The enchiladas came with some rice that absolutely blew me away. The perfect orange tint with the powerful flavor of lime was perfect with the mild refried beans sitting atop the crunchy tostada shell. The enchiladas came with green sauce and had perfectly tender chicken.This is definitely the spot I frequent when in the area and I love coming here!\"},\n",

Half the people there are ordering or waiting for their takeout when I went, but YMMV. The parking lot is TINY (like under 8 spots I believe) so you will probably have to end up finding street parking. We parked a block over on a side street and walked over but definitely bumper to bumper parking, it\\'s tight.I\\'ve came to Santa Barbara a few times but surprisingly have never tried Los Agaves. This is pretty much like the #1 rated place to eat on Yelp in Santa Barbara, so I knew I had to check it out. You can order at the counter and they give you a number to self seat in their back patio. I ordered the camarones guajillo and a strawberry margarita (FYI they have happy hour 11AM-5PM everyday for their margs). My friend ordered the Enchiladas Guadalajara.We were easily able to find a spot in the back patio, and were promptly served with chips and a few sauces. I loved their green sauce it was so good. We really devoured the whole basket and even asked for more sauce! The food did take about 40 minutes to come out, but the chips definitely shortened the wait. I also got my strawberry margarita within minutes, and it was delicious! Not so much strawberry taste as their was alcohol, it was pretty strong LOL and I only got a small. I loved the tajin rim, it added a nice touch.Anyway, our food finally comes and we are geeked! Like definitely ate a good amount of chips to be somewhat not hungry but I didn\\'t come here for chips! Lol. My dish was MOUTHWATERING AMAZING. The sauce the shrimp came in was actually so delicious. The shrimp was so juicy and cooked to perfection. I loved the diced pineapples within the dish too as the sweetness complimented the shrimp very well. The guajillo chilis were very mild and I was able to eat them. The dish also came with a side of rice and their house salad. I don\\'t know why but the rice was SO freaking good! Loved the cotija(?) cheese on top. The house salad was also delicious. It was very sweet and more of like a \"fruit\" salad. The entire dish was so amazing. My friend loved her enchiladas too, but it definitely seemed more of a basic dish. But also a solid staple you can\\'t go wrong with.Los Agaves is THE place to be. Like I have never had Mexican food this good and I will be dreaming about this until the day I come back. THANK YOU LOS AGAVES!!'},\n",

There are hardly any vegetarian options. We ordered the nachos and quesadillas. The nachos were not great and everything just had a lot of cheese especially, the quesadillas. Quesadillas were not at all warm and the cheese was just solid. I ended up paying $9.73 for the Guacamole that is \"Market Priced\" was so disappointing as you clearly see under the pictures. Even our server said that the Guacamole should have been around $3.00-4.00. The one sad option they have for tacos is the Taco Rajas Con Queso which looks so unappetizing, I would not order this again. Fajitas were so hard to digest.

First come, first serve outside dining and luckily several tables available to accommodate our party of 8. \\xa0I ordered a tostada salad with shrimp ($10.50, add $7 for the shrimp) and a single Jalisco Margarita ($10.50): fresh squeezed lime juice, tequila, triple sec, and agave nectar. Jalisco Margarita is weak and watered down. \\xa0My tostada was good and it came with a slightly sweet, creamy dressing on the side. \\xa0Shrimps were big and tasty. \\xa0Honestly, the free chips and several different salsa are my favorites. Not because they were free, lol. \\xa0See my pic -two of the salsas (there were 4) featured on my plate were the spiciest and taste the best. \\xa0Very small, free parking lot. \\xa0You're best bet is to find free street parking around the restaurant. \\xa0Overall, it was good enough restaurant to have a post-adventure meal at. \\xa0Stay safe and healthy (mind, body and soul) Yelping out there :)\"},\n",

Let me say, the food here did not disappoint. We decided to treat ourselves and ordered 3 entrees, and our order came with the usual complimentary chips with 4 different types of sauces (red sauce, green sauce, pico de gallo, and a darker salty sauce I'm not familiar with!)Agaves Burrito: They drenched that thing in their amazing chipotle sauce. It came with a side of rice and salad. You never usually expect much out of a side salad, but this one was actually pretty good! It had dried cranberries, tangerines, corn- and all the flavors worked very well together. As for the burrito itself, the fillings definitely were not distributed very well (one end of the burrito was all lettuce, and the other end was all the good stuff like shrimp/fish/guac,) but altogether it was very delicious.Mole Enchiladas: All their sauces are a hit, and the mole is no exception. It has that beautiful smoky sweetness, and came with a side of rice and beans. Chile Poblano Campestre: Looks-wise, not really sure what it is the way they presented it, but eating it was delicious! The description lists it as 2 corn tortillas with a poblano chile stuffed with meat and cheese, but in reality it was more like they cut the chile in half and flattened it, then put a layer of meat and cheese on top.\"},\n",

Food: We ordered the Chile Poblano Campestre with steak- delicious! Grilled perfectly with a fragrant smoky grill flavor, topped with cheese. Yummy. Al pastor tacos- i thought it was pretty good but my boyfriend loved it. He said it was the best al pastor he's had. Also got an order of their beef taquitos. This was very good but the tortilla was a bit too thick. Service: when we walked up it was confusing because we didn't know if we should wait to get seated or walk up and order then seat like the other location. A server finally noticed us and told us to order first. We walked up to the register to order and the person taking the order was not paying attention so she didn't notice us for about 2 minutes. She seemed either still new and learning or distracted because she had a hard time understanding our order, which was nothing special. Just ordered straight from the menu. She was still nice nonetheless. The reason for the 4 stars is the inside seating area was a bit dirty. Their walls where we sat near the front entrance had tons of food stains and actual caked on food. We looked around and all the walls were dirty. Floors needed to be swept too. Overall- delicious food! Needs better service and clean your walls lol\"},\n",

I could probably get full off the ceviche alone and still have leftovers.

This was definitely a great choice and I will visit again if I'm in the area and craving pretty authentic Mexican food. The only con I have is that they didn't have hand sanitizer for those who were dining outside. Even though they clean the tables, having sanitizer is pretty necessary in current times.\"},\n",

I said I won't be there until after that so no worries see them soon. The order came to $49 something and I thought.. WOW.

And we were afraid the salmon would be dry but man, it was succulent and cooked to perfection! If you aren't a fan or pineapple, you probably wouldn't like it because this dish is packed with pineapple flavors.Normally we aren't a big fan or Mexican food but this one is an exception. The flavors are good and they weren't too strong-y-mexican-y. The portion is also not very big, so it doesn't keep you full for a whole day. We were able to eat a normal dinner afterwards.\"},\n",

It was the star of my meal. It had a nice little kick to it that made it slightly spicy, but just the slightest. I don't do well with spicy so this was the perfect amount for me. The burrito came with a salad that I wasn't expecting! I don't normally love salads but this one came with some fruit and was super sweet and crunchy. The dish also came with your typical Mexican rice.The Asada Nachos were a perfect table splitter for the group. My friend preferred the nachos over her dish! The nachos were a little soft and they kept breaking in half for me, but I was able to make do. They provided a generous amount of asada and guacamole so I was a happy camper. Very large dish and it was layered well that I could eat all the flavors with one chip.I would come back and maybe try other dishes, but I wouldn't mind getting these same 2 dishes again!\"},\n",

I forgot I came here years ago with my mother when we visited the mission and we loved it then. The difference from then to now is the COVID-19 measures they made. We ate at the back of the restaurant beside the parking lot. When you ordered the employees were all masked and wore gloves. We ordered at the register with a plexus glass separating us. All standard. They also cleaned and disinfected the tables and chairs after each guests left. The food was really good and definitely hit the spot after several hours of driving. The mole enchiladas was my favorite but that's not a surprise since I do favor ordering that. The ceviche was delicious and had plenty of shrimp. Both tasted fresh and had plenty of flavored. We also ordered from the children menu and ordered the cheese quesadilla which my son loved. Overall, I am glad I came here and again. The food was delicious and we felt safe from the measure taken by the restaurant.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'This isn\\'t my first review for Los Agaves since they have several locations, but this location happens to be where it all started. I remember my first meal being the \"Carne Atzeca\". It was a delicious grilled NY steak, with a stuffed Anaheim pepper, grilled nopalito, chorizo, and a cute little tostada shell bowl filled with their unique beans. Definitely a different take on mexican food that couldn\\'t be found elsewhere in town. The food, and presentation were on point and the amount of food was more than enough. Ever since then I\\'ve been a fan of Los Agaves but unfortunately, I don\\'t come here quite as often due to their increased prices. Now it\\'s a treat to come here whenever I have extra money to splurge.I will say that the Family meals they have offered for take-out during COVID19 are definitely worth the price! Ranging from $37 - $45; not only is the food served fresh, and hot, but the portion serving is more than generous! They also provide a nice range of their delicious salsas with tortilla chips. So, kudos to them for putting this together during hard times. You can find their temporary menu at the following link: los-agaves.com/temp-menu \\xa0OH! And let\\'s not forget you can also order beer or margaritas to go during their daily happy hour (11am - 5pm). They have some great margarita flavors to choose from such as Jamaica, mango pineapple, Tamarindo con Chile, blood orange, and their house margarita. The only catch is you must order food if you\\'re planning to take it to go. I went in to pick up my food for take-out last week and they appeared to be open for dining. I\\'m sure the capacity will be cut in half unlike Pre-COVID where it was always jam packed with people inside, and lines forming outside the door. As of right now all restaurants in town are open for inside dining with limited seating, and new guidelines. Be sure to take your mask regardless! Overall, I love supporting our local restaurants when I can, but it\\'s been tough during this quarantine. I greatly appreciate the cleanliness, and extra precautions all of our restaurants have taken to safely handle, prepare, and serve us.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"We stopped in for an earlier dinner this evening. This restaurant was both recommended by friends and highly rated on yelp which made it an obvious choice. Or so we thought. Overall, our resounding impression was 'meh'. Average at best. Especially at a relatively higher price point for an area with so much Mexican food available. The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio with plentiful seating and spacing between tables for distancing. The employees all diligently wore masks and gloves which was reassuring.We ordered the steak burrito mojado and the shrimp fajitas (about $13 and $20 respectively). We were given a number and told to pick our own table. Unfortunately, we had to ask for water three times since we weren't allowed to serve ourselves and the staff seemed to keep forgetting...The steak burrito was decently sized and doused with a red sauce plated alongside orange rice, guacamole and sour cream. The rice was tasty and the steak well cooked, but overall nothing special. I don't eat wet burritos very often so it could very well have been normal, but the red sauce was reminiscent of a marinara/tomato/Ragu type sauce doused over the burrito. Not so great. While the steak was well cooked, I felt the seasoning was more salt than anything. Difficult to enjoy the saltiness especially with no water...As for the shrimp fajitas, decently large shrimp on a bed of mostly bell peppers. The shrimp seemed well cooked but, alas, the taste was on the fishier side that overpowered the dish. Was hoping for better, but unfortunately Los Agaves was a miss. Probably wouldn't return unless we had to.\"},\n",

My first order was the Chicken Chimichanga and I will say it wasn't a great choice for me. The chicken was really dry and I was a little turned off by that meal, so much that I couldn't finish it. However, I've gone back because I've heard so many good things and had to give it a second try. The second time ordering was a...success! This time I got the steak nachos and it was a loaded and large portion that I was happily struggling to eat. That $11 nachos were looking more like a $16 plate with the size! I'm a hard nacho critic, so I say this with love, it was pretty good! It wasn't stellar and I wouldn't give that dish five stars because there wasn't enough cheese to get me through the billion perfectly salted chips, but the flavor and portions were good for the price. Now on to my next dish, which has earned this rating four stars...The quesadillas and tacos are amazing! I ordered the quesadillas for my mom and that's all she wanted for the rest of her visit to SB.

It's covid times and sweltering hot outside, so appreciate that the service was really quick and that they provided ice cold water. \\xa0Horchata was also especially refreshing. Also, the outdoor dining patio was shaded with umbrellas and tables were actually spaced far enough apart that I felt comfortable eating there. It was around 1PM (Labor Day Sunday) when we finished eating, and the line to order was still long, and still people waiting for a table. Would definitely come back again.\"},\n",

By the time we ordered, they had a table ready for us and the food arrived pretty quickly after that. The salsa bar is a must! I tried a few and really couldn't pick a favorite since they were all loaded with flavor and the perfect spice. I was able to find a low carb/keto friendly option with ease here and it wasn't the normal fajitas. I ordered the shrimp and cheese stuffed poblanos with a side cesar salad and roasted veggies. Everything tasted great, the filling was loaded with tender shrimp and tons of cheese.The portion was huge! I ended up taking home a chile for lunch the next day.Definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area.\"},\n",

They don't really add anything of significance to the Molcajetes experience.This would have been a four stars, but their yelp prices are vastly different than what I paid for. I paid over 20 dollars for their legendary Molcajetes.Over 20 dollars is way too much. Even with steak.But the Molcajetes was pretty good. It's supposed to be a spicy marinated tomato based stew. However, it really wasn't that spicy, rather \\xa0hot. I needed to add jalapeños to give it more heat.They have a pretty big salsa bar, and everything is homemade including their tortillas. I wasn't sure what to do with the homemade tortillas to be honest. You can put the chorizo or whatever you ordered (steak, chicken, shrimp) in it, but to me, it makes it messy, and the tortillas don't really serve a purpose.For Twenty dollars, I was expecting more meat. Instead, it was mostly broth based. If you are to make a sandwich from the tortillas, probably best add in more to justify the twenty dollar price tag.\"},\n",

All of the margaritas were decent however my absolute favorite was the house. The classic Jalisco was refreshing as well as the perfect balance between sweet and tart. Overall the house margarita was a little bit more complex in taste then the other offerings ironically. The shrimp taco with the black salsa will change your life. Honestly the black salsa on anything makes it 20 million times better however my favorite food items are the crunchy chicken taco as well as the shrimp taco with the black salsa.

Honestly the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Order from the counter, take a number, and wait for your food to be delivered to the table while you snack on complementary chips and salsa. Speaking of salsa, their salsa bar is LEGIT. 8-10 verities of salsa ranging in spiciness. Unlike many salsa bars they let you take as much as you want which is music to my condiment loving tastebuds. I've had the land and sea mocajete, loaded with shrimp, fish, chicken & steak. It was literally still boiling by the time out meal was over. Their pinto beans come as a side to most dishes and are served in an adorable tortilla cup. They are adequately staffed so service is quick and food arrives 10-15 minutes after ordering, sometimes way sooner. Don't miss this spot, it's especially perfect if you need a bite before a event at the SB Bowl (right down the street)!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I ordered COVID era take out this last week. Looking around: this unit is very similar than the unit in which i usually eat on De La Vina. They had their COVID regulations in place with no service inside except for take out orders. They offered waiter service outside where the tables were appropriately spaced.The details seemed all in place for a nice outdoor dining experience but one tempered with the rules of doing restaurant business in this very difficult year, 2020.Also: plan your visit here carefully because there is an inordinate amount of road work and construction in what used to be a sleepy eastside area of SB particularly around lunch time.In any event i ordered:2 Chile Relleno Burritos with rice and guacamole.An order of Mole enchiladas(we received a big bag of freshly fried chips and a trio of their super good salsas.)One thing was a bit off-putting: El Precio total! \\xa0are we really at the point in our food restaurant history where 2 burritos and a plate of enchies cost 50 bucks??Now the food:The Chiles Rellenos are famous here and rightfully so. The Chiles used are not out of a can and i assume roasted or grilled and stuffed here and it is plenty big for 2. Biting into it it burst with cheesy goodness as well as the taste of a savory grilled Pasilla(?) chile. this burrito was mostly chile and cheese with a little rice and beans. Good Stuff.The Mole here is one of my favorites but this order of enchiladas was not up to par with too many bits of overcooked chicken almost ruining the experience. But the super primo Mole sauce here is one of the best i have ever eaten anywhere including in Oaxaca, Mexico (where probably this recipe originated...just a guess). The Mole is obviously built with layers of garlic, onions, several types of chiles, chocolate, etc. their Mole person really knows what she is doing. I bow down to her/him! (in reality i would bet that the Moleria is a woman...)Service was quick and pleasant though it is a little odd to see the insides of the restaurant bare: actually set up for a DISCO! experience.Very Good food and service today at a Los Agaves unit that i visited for the first time.Cheers!'},\n",

       "  'review': \"Personally, I think the hype for Los Agaves is a bit too high. But with so many Yelp reviews and long lines, I insisted that my girlfriend and I give them a try during our recent trip to Santa Barbara.My first question is: What happens to the people that dine-in and have no place to sit? Considering my girlfriend and I barely found a seat, I'm guessing the crowds that piled in after us were forced to take all of their food to go?Anyway, Los Agaves offers up Mexican food. A lot of Mexican food. The menu attempts to cover a lot of ground - probably too much, in fact. The food is priced as more of a mid-tier sit-down restaurant, but done using an order at the counter approach.Los Agaves isn't bad by any means. My rajas con queso and carne asada tacos were both decent - with the asada being far, far better than what I experienced the previous day at Lilly's Tacos. My gringa al pastor, which is a greasy, cheesy quesadilla wasn't too bad, but by no means the best version I've ever tried. My girlfriend's Enchiladas Guadalajara were fine, but once again, weren't quite anything memorable in comparison to some of her favorites.Beans and rice were both on-point, while guacamole was also what you'd expect.Maybe for Santa Barbara's limited options, Agaves is a gold-mine. But if you're well acquainted with good Mexican food outside of the area, you'll realize that Agaves isn't really anything special. In other words, there's nothing here that feels exclusive.In the end, it's worth a visit, but probably not a place I'd ever return to in the future. But for tourists and locals, it's easily a solid choice.\"},\n",

Every time we have guests visiting, we bring them here!You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. For starters, the horchata is the best I've ever had and is housemade. Yes! You get free chips and salsa with your order. My favorite item on the menu are the mole enchiladas, but I usually get them with shredded chicken. I also love their chile relleno. The rice which comes with most orders is also the best mexican rice I, or literally anyone else who has been there has ever had! And the beans are perfect and come in a little tortilla cup. Last time I came here, I took my boyfriend to get ceviche for the first time in his life. It was the green ceviche on the specials menu. We both loved it! Oh yeah, did I mention that service is amazing too. You really feel like you're in Mexico when you step in because of how hospitable, kind, and accommodating everyone else. Se hablan español por aqui y they do an immaculate job of getting everyone waiting in line a table to sit at, even if every table is initially full. I don't know how they do it, en serio, but they do the damn thing! So don't be intimidated by the line or the the unfamiliarity of the dishes if you've never had authentic Mexico food before.

The only downside to the fish tacos was the slaw that they add to the tacos kind of over does it for me. I know it's the type of style when they flood your corn tortilla with a lot of the mango slot to give it a good contrast to the halibut, But I actually enjoyed the holiday just without that slaw. And the chips and salsa were complementary and the salsa was very good definitely made in house and on the spicier side. During COVID 19 I wasn't sure what to expect but overall I was extremely impressed with their staff attentiveness and the way I was able to come in order and sit immediately.

We found the place based on the high rating and number of reviews on Yelp. Once again, Yelp didn't disappoint!First of all - we came around 3 pm, and there was a short line to order at the counter. The cashier was super helpful and gave us great recommendations. After ordering, you seat yourself. Most tables were full, so I can imagine that it gets pretty crazy during the lunchtime rush!Once seated, they give you a basket of tortilla chips and there is a self-serve salsa bar by the cashier. The avocado crema was my personal favorite - creamy and super fresh!I ordered the molcajete with steak and absolutely LOVED it... It came out sizzling hot and smelled so great! I wasn't really sure how to eat it - they provided me with some corn tortillas but I actually preferred drinking it as a stew and dipping chips in it (with avocado crema on top yummmmm). It was a little spicy and smoky, but just the right amount. The stew looked like a lot of sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat that was hiding under the surface! And all super tender!We also got the ceviche as a starter, and my husband got the chicken nachos as an entree. Both were great, but be careful - the portions are all huge! We thought the ceviche would be a smaller portion, but it was as big as (or maybe even bigger than) a full entree portion. Also the nachos were a little redundant since we already had lots of chips & salsa.All in all, I would definitely come back here and order the molcajete again.

My favvvv thing to eat on earth, also in Santa Barbara. \\xa0Additionally, the Los Agaves location in Goleta is fun as well: they are the sweetest humans always offering a complimentary taco or margarita. \\xa0But alll I ever prefer is their sweet iced tea. \\xa0Parking is complicated be prepared to walk a handful of blocks or just walk off your tacos \\xa0afterward. Also, it's a cozy casual upscale restaurant which is perpetually appreciated over a taco stand, especially during this winter season.\"},\n",

Not sure you can tell by the picture how wonderfully rich and full bodied it was. The beans were also very good, authentic flavor without the frills. Appreciated all the vegetarian meals they offered since my kids hardly eat meat. My husband's beef and lamb barbacoa tacos were also very good. They gave a big bowl of barbacoa juice on the side, which honestly I could slurp right up if it wasn't for the after effects of heartburn. Great service during the pandemic too. Saw the staff constantly sanitizing tables and surfaces. They all wore gloves and masks, as did we until we ate.\"},\n",

The crispy taco was a bit on the greasy side but the chicken itself was a bit of a downer as it was dry and the only way to save it was to drench it in pico de gallo. As for the enchiladas they too sucked as the chicken were overly dry but since they were covered in sauces it was manageable. Presentation was good all around.

       "  'review': \"I was just passing by Santa Barbara for lunch and decided to stop at Los Agaves. It's apparently the most viewed restaurant in the area on Yelp. I got the garden burrito and it was STUFFED. It has pinto beans and lots of grilled peppers and zucchini inside. The pinto beans was like a sauce for the filling. Very flavorful and an amazing vegetarian option. It's definitely very popular lunch place because there's was a line to order food just as I was leaving the place. They have complimentary chips and a salsa bar. Highly recommend coming here if you haven't already!\"},\n",

The Agaves seafood burrito is covered with a drool-worthy chipotle sauce. This is one that you just have to close your eyes and savor -- it's that tasty. The chicken mole enchiladas were topped with homemade mole sauce. Delicious, yummy, mole sauce :)Portions were hearty, so my friend and I essentially had two nights worth of dinners from one meal. I will most definitely return, and I absolutely recommend this place!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I was really looking forward to coming to this place while on vacation with my family but sadly I was extremely disappointed. 1st the location is not too good. Not much parking and lots of transients around the area 2nd and most importantly the food is just not good. It is also not cheap which made me even more upset. My son ordered the mole enchiladas. He loves mole so we thought this was a good choice for him. When the tried his enchiladas he spat them out. He said all he could taste was cinnamon. He ended up only eating the rice and beans. I ordered a wet burrito with steak. The cheese inside was cold, the burrito itself had no flavor. It was so bland and I wondered how even the red sauce it was smothered in was so flavorless. I am truly surprised how this place has such high reviews. Then again both of my parents are from Mexico so maybe I expect more from Mexican restaurants. But all I wanted was some flavor. Oh well now we know which Mexican restaurant to avoid when in Santa Barbara.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Was recommended to come here as this was a \"must eat\" when you\\'re in Santa Barbara and it didn\\'t disappoint. Definitely lived up to the hype for me! Although it may at first seem a little pricey, but the portions and flavor/quality of the food live up to their price. I came around 5:30pm on a Friday and had to wait in line for about 25 minutes (we were at the door). Definitely come in earlier than later, the line was around the building as we left!This is not a traditional sit-down restaurant, instead you order and pay first and then either self-seat your party with a number or a staff member can help you find/organize table. I feel like the line only went slow because people did not know what to order when they got to the register. There are plenty of menus, so use the time in line to figure out what you will be eating.SERVICE: There are a ton of people there and they are really good at multitasking. Food also came out very efficiently too, which I always appreciate.PARKING: Parking on the street or in the residential area for free. TORTILLA CHIPS: Free tortilla chips whoo! From what I know, they\\'re unlimited but one was enough for my boyfriend and I. BURRITO MOJADO: You have the option to choose between steak ($12.50) and chicken ($11.95). I got the STEAK and it was so good! This was a wet burrito that came with plenty of grilled steak, pinto beans, and monterey jack cheese with queso fresco and salsa roja on top. This was so good!!! It also came with rice, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, and pico de gallo on the side. I definitely could not finished this by myself and shared it with my boyfriend. Would hands down get this again! TACOS DEL MAR: You get 2 tacos and have the option to choose both shrimp ($14.50), both pescado ($13.50), or 1 of each ($13.95). I got the COMBO and definitely liked the SHRIMP better than the PESCADO. There were 3 shrimp in the taco and they were all very flavorful! The pescado one was just average to me, nothing stood out about it. The corn tortillas did fall apart easily, which made it difficult to share...prepare for a little bit of a messy meal! This also comes with a side of rice and house salad (surprisingly liked their sweet dressing with sour mango bits on salad) which I enjoyed both of. If I were to get this again, I would get just shrimp. SAUCES: They offer a self-serve sauce bar. Here\\'s what I tried.-SALSA CHIPS (Mild): This was more tomato-y and was great for the chips!-SALSA TOMATILLO (Medium): I enjoyed this as well, but have a preference for red sauce over green. So I would choose chipotle over this one. -SALSA CHIPOTLE (Medium): This was my favorite sauce to use and the kick was perfect! Maybe teetering on too much, but this was my favorite.-PICO DE GALLO: Great!!-SALSA AGUAMENTE (Medium): This was more of a mild spicy if anything and more of an avocado salsa. Liked it too!Definitely want to come back in the future! We saw someone\\'s order of al pastor tacos that were LOADED and want to order that next time! We also kind of wanted to try the molcajetes, but figured that was difficult to share between just 2 people.'},\n",

So of course when I made my way to Santa Barbara I had to stop by.I came by for lunch on a Saturday and the joint was PACKED OUT!!!!So the way it works is as follows:You wait in line, while in line you should look at the menu instead of like me wait til I get to the counter (lol).Once you're at the counter you gotta put in your order AND pay. Then go ahead and find ya seat and the most agonizing part is waiting for the food....I actually look for the opportunity to come back and try a better option.I ordered what I thought would be the BEST EVER BURRITO!!! That isn't the name of what I ordered, just my expectation....I ordered the Agaves Burrito....The burrito was straight up MASSIVE!!!I ordered with something about lit just didn't add up well. The fish and shrimp plus the chipotle sauce just messed it up! I think I would order without the chipotle sauce. On the other hand My friend ordered the Enchiladas GDL!!He enjoyed them so much! They also had this dish with a HUGE PORTION!!He let me try and I was def a fan of them.See ya next time Los Agaves :)\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat at in the Santa Barbara area! The prices are about average for the area, but Los Agaves ups its bang-for-the-buck ratio by giving you pretty generous portions. I've never left Los Agaves with extra room in my stomach.Their Burrito Mojado (wet burrito) is highly recommended. The sauce that's poured over the burrito not only makes it more flavorful, but reduces that heavy feeling you get from wolfing down a burrito. I also appreciate the guac and rice that's included with the order. The chicken nachos are super delicious. The portion size and the nature of nachos make this order great for sharing amongst a couple of people. There's a lot of flavor coming from the guac and sauces, and even the chicken is flavored well. If you're looking for a visual feast to go with your uh, feast, the Beef Molcajetes is a nice switch-up from the standard Mexican cuisine food. It comes in a stone mortar, complete with sauce, nopales (cactus pads), avocado, cheese, and your choice of meat. It's served with tortilla, and while it's visually impressive, it's not quite as filling as the other items, in my opinion. In addition to its delicious food, dining in also gives you the luxury of unlimited chips and salsa! There's a complete salsa bar with onions, cilantro, a countless variety of sauces, and more. My personal hack: in a small water cup, mix cilantro, pico de gallo, onions, and the green guac-colored sauce. Add a dash of lime juice, and mix it all together. It's my favorite sauce combination to pair with their chips!\"},\n",

Originally, we wanted to eat at La-Superica but didn't want to wait 30+ min for food. We found Los Agaves on yelp and decided to give it a try based on their stellar reviews! Glad we did! Food was amazing! Not a typical sit-down restaurant. You order and pay for your food at the counter, find a seat, and wait for your food to be served. They also have an array of sauces at their sauce bar - ranging from mild to spicy and provide unlimited baskets of homemade chips to your table. YUM. I ordered the Enchiladas Guadalajara - Two enchiladas with shredded chicken or beef topped with our homemade salsa verde or salsa roja, melted Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream. SO DELICIOUS. Huge portions too! Flavorful but not overpowering. It came with a mango creamy side salad that I enjoyed. Ate it the next day as left overs and it was just as good! The bf ordered the Carne Asada Fajitas that was also delicious. The steak was tender and full of flavor. Definitely a go to spot when visiting Santa Barbara!\"},\n",

The burrito had shrimp and fish inside with their special chipotle sauce on top w/ pieces of mango. The burrito came with a side salad & rice (you can sub the rice or salad at no extra cost.) The employees were so nice, helpful and efficient. It was a bit busy the evening we went (Sunday around 2pm) but they still managed to take our order within a few minutes and bring out our food as fast as posible.

No regrets especially since the foods were beyond delicious! The same molcajetes would cost at least $25-$30 back in LA. Loaded with every protein imaginable (giant shrimp, flakey white fish, thick cut chorizo, diced chicken, sliced beef), topped with bubbling cheese and fresh sliced avocado, paired with house made fresh corn tortilla = meal made in vacay heaven! Agaves enchiladas - The enchiladas were well made - bursting with fish and shrimp. The fresh citrus, cranberry salad and fluffy rice paired nicely. I however didn't love their house special enchilada sauce. I thought it tasted too similar to ranch dressing (maybe with a dash of tomato sauce/salsa).

I would describe it as a more upscale Mexican restaurant, but with very quick service! They always seem to be crowded but I've never had to wait long for my food. One of my favorites is the Tacos Del Mar. This dish comes with 2 loaded tacos, a rice pilaf, and a side salad. Of course, I can't forget the basket of chips and accompanying salsa bar. You won't leave here hungry. I recommend getting one shrimp and one fish taco. You also must try the enchiladas! I love the chipotle sauce they use to top the Agaves Enchiladas, so much that I wish they had it on the salsa bar. Speaking of the salsa bar, they have about six salsa options, cilantro, and lime. By far the best is the avocado salsa. Sometimes the other salsas are a little inconsistent depending on the day.\"},\n",

The cheese added too much savoriness for the seafood, where I wanted something with a bit more punch to it. I thought the chipotle sauce on top would be the thing, but that ended up tasting less spicy or tangy, and more like straight mayonnaise and sour cream mixed together. All in all, it overpowered the rest of the burrito, and I found myself just trying to extract the fish, shrimp, and bell peppers from the chipotle dosed tortilla.I tried a few bites of the tampiquena. It had a lot of flavor, and was definitely better than the agaves burrito, but still nothing to write home about in my opinion.\"},\n",

In addition, tons of Santa Barbara locals tell me that this is the best Mexican restaurant here.My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday at 7pm and got in a line that almost went out the door. We get our chance to order at the front at 7:20pm. We both get the agaves enchiladas and enchiladas guadalajara. After we put our order in, in which we expected him to repeat the order, he tells us that they ran out of rice. Not sure how a restaurant runs out of rice during the dinner rush on a Saturday. Nevertheless we asked if we could have extra meat or beans instead. He said that we can only have extra salad on the side. I assumed that we could be compensated for the missing rice.So we got extra salad because that was our only option. We sit down to the table and luckily we get our food within 15 minutes, hence the one star given.The reason why this restaurant is given only one star however is because the meat in our dish tasted very dry and under seasoned. We left the place rather unpleasant. We could have had our dish replaced (something we could've done on our part) but we were too displeased to do so.\"},\n",

There are menus you can look at while you wait so once you're up at the front, you can tell the cashier what you want to order. A number is given, and you find a table. It was crazy busy so the waitstaff helps you find a table. If you order a margarita (made with wine), you have to wait for it on the side. PROS:*Homemade everything- their tortillas, all their sauces, most of it is made from scratch and you can taste it*Price vs portions is well balanced- we had plenty of leftovers!*Fajitas Del Mar- I give a 4/5. They went a little overboard in cooking the bell peppers and onions in too much oil. Shrimp and fish pieces were meaty and well flavored*salsa bar- you help yourself*Nachos- cheese, black beans, hard to go wrong and the dish is huge*hubs ordered the well liked Agave burrito which is a fish burrito, wet style so it is served with plenty of sauce in top*good service- despite how crazy it was inside, all of the servers were working hard and friendlyCONS:My gosh, it is crowded. One restroom for women and the line next to the ordering line was over crowding the drink and salsa bar line. It was mayhem. Parking is on the streets, we parked quite a bit away uphill.

The Chile's Norteños included perfectly cooked shrimp stuffed into beautifully charred poblano - the combination of smoke and spice was incredible.

It is important to come with an appetite as the portions are quite large, most of what is on the menu will be great so it's very easy to finish it all but try out the tacos and horchata (I recommend the Tacos Norteño - something with a N which includes steak, bacon, and guacamole).Make sure to ask for the horchata in a glass (less plastic waste) and hit the salsa bar afterwards for the chips they immediately bring to the table. I also suggest making a trip up to Franceschi Park after or before a meal at Los Agaves for a wonderful view of Santa Barbara (although they really should cut the trees to open the view).\"},\n",

They were so filling and so delicious and they do not jip you on the meat. The carne asada was so delicious and not dry all. Its different in that the meat is like cut up steak rather than the kind of meat you see at food trucks. It also comes with your choice of black or pinto beans in a crispy tortilla cup and mexican rice on the side. I thought I'd still be hungry after this, but I couldnt even finish my plate (at least the beans portion).They also have a selection of drinks and beers to choose from. The horchata was very good, not too sweet and not too cinnamon-y. Theres also a bar for limes, sauces, cilantro, onion, salsa, etc. at your disposal. The meal also comes with complimentary chips while you wait for your real meal to roll through. You order first then hopefully you can find a table right after ordering as this place is sometimes super packed but definitely worth it.\"},\n",

I got the combo plate with an enchilada roja and a soft taco, and both were great. The arroz rojo tastes like my mom\\'s, and the carne asada, gently wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla, was tender. The beans came in a little taco shell bowl, which was cute (and also tasty). I try to reserve 5s for food that\\'s unique or outstanding, but I\\'ve bumped this review up to 5 because the restaurant itself was nicely decorated, the food was pretty good, and all the employees were friendly and efficient. I\\'ve never been a fan of burritos, but my boyfriend had the chile verde burrito and describes it with the following caveman-like description: \"Big hunks. Meat. Juicy.\" Clearly only one of us is a Yelper ;)Being from the Bay Area, I\\'ve started paying close attention to bathrooms - there are TWO individual bathrooms here, one for each gender. We parked on the street nearby with no problems, though it looks as though you could easily park in their lot as well. They make it easy to figure out that you order at the counter and seat yourself.

I tried 4 different kinds and every single one was outstanding. And I appreciated that their salsa cups were a generous size, none of those short flat cups here. BAM!I And the guacamole. Hands down... WHAM! SO good!Thought the \"order at counter\" was great but it had a great sit down vibe.I\\'ll be back the next time I\\'m in town.Fantastic!'},\n",

We love this city and try to do a lunch at a different spot each time. So beyond happy with lunch at Los Agaves. From the moment we walk in, we just felt so welcomed by all staff despite how busy it was. I loved the fast casual concept. We step to the counter and ordered and received a number. Local brews and SB wines available which is amazing. I hit up the salsa bar.... and I'm a salsa bar enthusiast. So many options! All so done so well and delicious! We sit and not too long after, we receive our appetizer. We ordered the chorizo queso fundido. Served with delicious homemade tortillas. This was ooey, gooey cheesy goodness. Entrees arrived shortly after. At this point, we've already had several people ask us if we needed anything or if they could get us anything. Service was top notch, better than most full service sit down restaurants. This was such a unique concept and I fully appreciated it. Back to the food. I ordered the arrachera and it came with a stuffed pepper and my husband ordered the enchilada suizas. Both were just perfect and tasty. My meat was tender and grilled perfectly. The cheesy pepper was just cheesy deliciousness. My husbands enchiladas had perfect big chicken chunks and just full of flavor. Beans were a miss but everything else was tasty so I didn't really care. I saw the managers and owners working so hard. I think it was all family. The older man who I believe was the owner stopped and touched every table, including ours, with a big genuine smile. I saw a younger manager looking guy running food and doing the same. They tidied up the salsa bar often, pre-bussed tables and kept the restaurant clean. The bathroom was immaculate... with a Dyson AND paper tables to appease all preferences. Aside from the incredibly tasty food, I was just blown away by the level of service, care, quality, and attention to every detail of this establishment. I know why they're busy and I would return back time and time again if I was local. I now understand why they have almost 3k reviews and remain at 4.5 stars. I'm so impressed with this place and can't wait to return on our next stop in SB. Come to OC, Los Agaves! Spread your love south!\"},\n",

There was not one empty dish in the house . we not once felt rushed or stressed . I ate my favorite dish which was stuffed peppers with cheese and meat ( yummmm) and my husband ate the wet burrito ( which was a favorite ) . I know very well that not everyone reading this will be coming here to celebrate their wedding but if you wish to support small business this is the spot .

The only negative was a homeless woman came into the restaurant, wandered around, staff seemed to ignore her but it was disturbing for guests, she was obviously on something. I feel compassion for people in need but as a paying customer think the staff should not allow this. As we were leaving, the woman was eating food from a takeout container near our car. Nice for the restaurant to help her but as mentioned wish she didn't wander around while we were eating.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Los Agaves does not disappoint! Usually my biggest complaint would be the order line, which is also totally understandable because this place is so good. Even so, we have always found a table by the time our food was ready. This time we found only a couple people ahead of us for our late lunch. And the food came practically flying out as it arrived with the complimentary basket of tortilla chips. For my order I was almost swayed in so many directions but stuck with one of my favorites, the tostada salad and wife got some grilled fish tacos that were delicious. The salsa bar offers many great fresh options, which I dished straight into my taco bowl to avoid the wasteful plastic containers. Perhaps our biggest delight was that they now have real tequila! We felt obligated to support this development with a couple of Agaves margaritas and a fresh draft Modelo beer back. \\xa0I also joined their new reward program on Thankx app for $5 off (if joined prior to order) and a rolling reward which I entend to cash in on.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Los Agaves was one of the top rated places to show up on yelp when I was looking for a place to eat in Santa Barbara. My boyfriend and I decided to drop by to grab some dinner when we were in town. Turns out you walk up to a counter, place your order, and then seat yourself. There are two large dining areas with tables so the place is pretty big. I think there is a small parking lot also right behind it.As first timers here, we weren\\'t sure what to order. The menu is pretty big and there is a large board with specials above the counter. I guess it looked like we were thinking hard because one of the staff members came by and talked to us about the menu. He was really nice and mentioned the molcajetes. We didn\\'t want to get two large meals so we ended up ordering the sea and earth molcajetes along with two fish tacos (from the side orders section). Our food came out and we realized that what we ordered could\\'ve sufficed as two large meals.Sea & Earth Molcajetes -- I think the sea and earth molcajetes was a bit overpriced. It\\'s about $18 and it comes out in a large stone bowl (just like what you\\'d see if you searched for \"molcajete\"). In the bowl you\\'ll find a tomato based soup/stew that\\'s filled with some seafood and meats (I think there was some chicken and chorizo). You\\'ll also find some other things such as cheese, onion, and avocado. The stew has a nice little kick to it and it\\'s pretty good - very flavorful. The molcajetes also comes with a few tortillas.Fish Taco(s) -- The other item we ordered was the fish tacos. The two tacos took over a plate and they were overloaded with the filling. Unfortunately, there wasn\\'t much flavor to them. I can\\'t put my finger on it but something was causing them to be bland - it was like there was something missing. Definitely a bit overpriced for being $5.50 a piece.I think Los Agaves is supposed to be a big deal. When I was in line for the restroom I saw an article pinned up about Los Agaves being the #16 on Yelp\\'s top 100 places to eat in the U.S.. I definitely want to go back the next time I\\'m in Santa Barbara and try something different!'},\n",

       "  'review': \"My wife and, while on our mini getaway to Santa Barbara, were looking for quality dinner options on a Monday night. We actually checked out both Yelp and TripAdvisor and Los Agaves kept popping up high on their list. It seemed like a no brainer to check them out.We arrived right before 6:00 PM and the parking lot behind the restaurant was quite empty...we even thought they weren't open quite yet, but they were.Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly staff member, Jamie, who informed us we just needed to check out the menu as well as the menu items up on the wall behind the counter, place our order, fill our drinks, find a table, then display the number handed to us and a server will deliver our food to our table.Before long, fresh tortilla chips were delivered to our table and my wife was off to the salsa bar with their myriad of delectable salsa choices with varying heat. She opted for the tomatillo (medium) and pico de gallo and I tried the salsa made with some grilled peppers. I think we liked the tomatillo best.My wife ordered the chili verde burrito served with Spanish rice, sour cream and guacamole. I inquired about their molcajetes as one was served past us as we were making our choices, but in the end I opted for the steak picado served with Spanish rice, beans and fresh corn tortillas. Both our dishes were full of flavor and my wife loved how tender the meat was. Portions were also quite generous.In addition to the flavorful dishes and huge portions, service was friendly and attentive. We liked how the manager, Ray, interacted with the customers and eagerly communicated how the owners were from Mexico and travelled extensively throughout Mexico to pick out dishes for inclusion into their menu.All in all, a very good experience! Dinner for 2 came out to just over $36 but we left a generous tip on top of that. We'll have to come back here the next time we're in Santa Barbara.\"},\n",

I knew Julia Child, ate Breakfast with her in Aspen, and she never mentioned anything about Tacos! I go to Los Agaves because it\\'s extraordinary!!! Standing in line to order I\\'m tempted by all the dishes people are eating! Do I order the Molcajetes, the enchiladas, the tacos? Maybe a combo plate? It\\'s impossible to decide! Each dish is perfect in execution!!! Today my wife and I shared an order of Guacamole and the House Special Molcajetes Arrachera, basically a carved lava mortar and pestle bowl, that is filled with Arrachera (skirt steak), grilled nopal, Monterey Jack, chorizo, grilled chambray onion, avocado, grilled peppers and salsa! It radiates heat as it has been sitting on an open flame! It\\'s boiling hard. I dip a homemade flour tortilla into the hot spicy red broth just for a taste, and my mind exploded!!! My wife was equally stunned! It is not often, being from Los Angeles, with a wife from New Mexico that we encounter something completely new and off the charts in Mexican Cuisine. In many ways this dish reminded me of the originality of food found in New Mexico or the \\xa0Tlacoyos and Tlayudas found in Oaxaca neighborhoods in Los Angeles! This is a dish that took my breath away!! Los Agaves is wonderful! The entire experience is! The service is very quick, very friendly! There was a huge line, out the door and down the street at 2:00Pm on a Saturday, but it moved quickly, and in the process I discovered something new to eat!!! Bravo!!!'},\n",

I decided to get the shrimp fajitas which was a great choice!! They were one of the most expensive things on the menu ($17) which isn't bad and speaks to the inexpensiveness of the restaurant. After we ordered food, we found a table and enjoyed chips and salsa. Their salsas weren't my favorite and the chips could have been hotter. When my food came it was steaming and looked amazing. Pretty big portion and huge shrimps!! It tasted amazing! The veggies were delicious and so were the shrimps! It was a good mixture of shrimp to veggie ratio. The only thing I was missing was maybe a zucchini in the fajitas but that's it! They were so good and really well seasoned! My plate came with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream!

       "  'review': \"We first went to Los Agaves in January 2018. We loved it so much that we ate there twice over a weekend. In my mind, it beaconed as a reason why going back to Santa Barbara on its own.I'm kind of glad we did not because we had lunch there last Sunday on our drive back from Cambria.I could say that I am more accustomed to Mexican food after moving to LA, but I was far less amazed than a year and a half ago. It is good, but not amazing. Especially, I remember the Molcajetes was far richer, more creamy and tasted long cooked, with lots of cheese melted inside, and overall darker with the meat melting inside: this time I got the chicken molcajetes, it was more tomato-y than spicey, and the chicken was regular grilled chicken that was thrown in just before. I actually seem to recall that upon our first visit they told us that the molcajetes would take longer to prepare, while this time it arrived instantly.On Sundays it is very very crowded. It's perfectly fine, but it also means that as you eat the staff will be constantly rearranging tables and chairs around you to accomodate the patrons as they arrive.Due to the chaos, service was so-so: we were not offered any refill of salsa, and the guacamole we ordered never arrived so that, at one point, we asked if we could had another Margarita instead: they obliged, but I don't know which one was more expensive. Now that I think of it, being past 2PM, we clearly lost at the exchange.Basically, either the quality went downhill in a year, or I got much more acquainted with the SoCal Mexican food scene so that I was less impressed... one thing for sure: avoid this place on Sundays at rush hour.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm so glad I stopped by on my trip to SB! My friend said they had the best chicken torta he's ever had and it was also recommended by a friend who goes to ucsb, we had to try it. Parking-Not sure if theres a lot behind, but there's street parking available. You get in line and order first before sitting down. All the empty tables have a number on it but you give them the number that was on there once you sit down. I think it's so customers who order first have a table reserved for them. Also if you plan to order to go, I'd recommend calling your order in. There were a lot of people standing by the salsa bar while waiting for their food. Also you can't really tell who's waiting in line for the restroom and who's waiting for food since everyones just standing around. My bf and I tried a bunch of different places before coming here so we wanted to split something small. We couldn't find the torta so we asked when we ordered and the girl said they only have the torta at certain times of the year. hopefully the next time I stop by, they have the tortas. We got the beef enchilada plate with a beef taco on the side. You get chips once you sit down and grab some salsa from the salsa bar. The chips were so good! I don't know if they make them there but I really liked it. Also the salsas were really good. the green/avocado salsa had a kick to it but I loved it. the enchilada was really good and had a lot of meat inside of it. The rice.... omg SO GOOD. probably the best I've ever had. Also the beans were really good too. I really don't like beans and they had the refried beans but it tasted so good. I could actually eat it with my food. The taco was also good too! my bf really liked it. overall I really liked the food here. Tastes really good, fresh and authentic. Def will be back for those tortas (if you're reading this and work for los agaves, please bring back the tortas!!!!)\"},\n",

Ive been to the Los Agaves in Goleta and on De La Vina street on a few occasions and none of them comes close to the consistency of this location. After living in San Diego for several years I've developed this insatiable desire for good Mexican food on an almost daily basis. The Agaves burrito here is one of the best wet seafood burritos I have ever had; it comes with halibut, shrimp, guacamole, and monterey jack cheese. They also throw in a delicious side of fried rice and house salad that's topped with fruit and vinaigrette. The portions here are gigantic and could easily feed a couple people so come hungry. In the main room it also has an open salsa bar that's constantly well stocked with a ton of variety sauces from pico de gallo to spicy tapatio. \\xa0The service here is quick and they do a fantastic job keeping the restrooms and tables clean. It was a busy tuesday afternoon and they had my burrito out to me in 4-5 minutes tops along with a delicious cup of horchata. Parking can be kind of a pain in the evenings especially in the 7-8pm timeframe. The menu also has a wide selection of different enchiladas and tacos that I will be back to try again soon.\"},\n",

Arrived on a Saturday around 11pm and there was already a huge crowd. Good sign. We were seated right away and we got :Guacamole - So fresh!!! So vibrant! They have a full salsa bar as well so you can almost make your own nachos 0_0Sea & Earth Molcajetes - I died and went to heaven. My sister in law kept trying to eat my molcajetes and I had to shoot her dirty looks. I dont mind sharing food but not when its this good! Has a little heat but not really spicy. The seafood is huge and fresh. They also give you handmade tortillas and when you make little tacos out of the sauce and the protein its magic. Enchiladas - So soft so delicious! Mother in law loved it. Sister in law had a fish dish that was topped with pineapples but it was a special of the day. Again the seafood here is amazing and so delicious. We all left very impressed by the service an the food. My mother in law asked me for the business card so she could bring my father in law. All the way to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles. That good.Cant wait to try the Westlake Location in Los Angeles. I pray its as good as the one in Santa Barbara.'},\n",

I'm happy to report that Los Agaves were incredibly great about accommodating vegan requests. Their food overall is just how I remembered it: fresh, homemade where possible, and absolutely delicious! I couldn't wait to have my daughter's left over rice and beans, sipping their flavorful horchata (sipping* because I want to relish it!), and chomping down their chips and multiple levels of spiciness salsas. The hubby inhaled their mushroom tacos, and I had a delightfully filling and healthy salad (SO hard to come by in a Mexican restaurant!). \\xa0The cherry on top was the service: all smiles and occasional visit from what looked like the owner to make sure our group was doing well.

When and by whom, I'll never know, but I'm hard-pressed to disagree.At 5 PM on a Friday, Los Agaves was plenty packed. Thankfully, the structure of the restaurant entrance is set up so that you can stand off to the side and decide what to get from their large menus. I have friends who are big fans of their burrito mojado, flautas, enchiladas, mole, and even their chips and guac, so it doesn't seem like you can go wrong here.Last week, I sprung for their tacos plaza de toros, which include carne asada, chorizo, and chicharron to top it off. The plate comes with a roasted pepper, fried garlic bulb, and a mini tortilla shell filled with pico de gallo and guacamole. While their carne asada isn't nearly as flavorful as Lilly's, their chicharron and chorizo shone. The pico de gallo is also a winner, using fresh jalapenos. The portion, at roughly $12, is more than enough for one average stomach. Heated up after a Santa Barbara Bowl concert, the last taco tasted so good.Milpas is a hub of delicious Mexican food and the flavor of Santa Barbara's Eastside, and I'm happy that Los Agaves is just down the street from my housemate's workplace. If you're a tourist in town, this is the one place you absolutely must try!For Santa Barbara natives, Los Agaves is on Axxess!

The fish and shrimp were delicious and I loved the addition of the pineapple bits on top. I didn't feel as bloated as I usually do eating burritos. The rice and beans were on the side so you can decide how much to eat in every bite. Even the salad and the salad dressing were good!Chicken Molcajete: Very spicy and VERY hot so be careful! It comes in a pestle and mortar type bowl. It contains chorizo, chicken, and some crumbled cheese on top. The avocado on top was a great remedy to the heat that the dish brought.

Los Agaves offers a wide selection of dishes and features an extensive salsa bar as well!

I ordered the tacos del pastor which had 3 tacos with a combination of meats and guac on the side. Not a bad entrée as it definitely filled me up. I also tried their margarita which wasn't too bad. The salt was a bit too much for me in my opinion. Generally this place is great and the atmosphere is lively.Things to be aware here:1)Park along the residential area and not on the main road. It's easier to find parking on the smaller side streets. Most street parking have a parking limit so read the signs carefully!2)One must order first to receive a number and then wait to be seated.

She leaned \\xa0and stretched her neck trying to read the screen of the phone, but not trying to hide that she was doing it. I put the phone down and continued our conversation.

I was very uncomfortable with her behavior, questions, and approach.

After he spoke with her she seemed satisfied enough to back off a bit but stayed nearby, no more than 5 feet away. I am at a loss as far as making sense of the situation as I have never encountered a situation like this. I found her behavior extremely unprofessional.*******As far as my other experiences:Full disclosure, I\\'m not a fan of Los Agaves food but I do like some plates here and there. I stick to the agaves salad, nachos, or ceviche. Sometimes they have a lime-cucumber-chia seed agua and I love that! I do not recommend their margarita, it was so bad it upset my stomach. I have been to all locations and service and quality of food is always consistent. I have noticed that they can be very sloppy with to-go orders, it would be better if they took the time to plate neatly. For example, I once ordered and agave salad with grilled shrimp but they topped the salad with the hot shrimp and closed the container, so the lettuce wilted by the time we got home. The setting of the restaurants is nice, they\\'re usually bright and airy, very clean, but can get very noisy and crowded.'},\n",

Our group of 10 were \"Buggie\"ing near the beach all afternoon and were sort of famished by the time we arrived at this restaurant. Service:We were not sure how the setup worked. We must have arrived at peak time as there were at least 10 patrons in line ahead of us. There was not an empty table anywhere. I guess you order and then they set up a table for you? Half way through our wait, we noticed a larger group leave the restaurant. We politely queried an employee if we could reserve the just vacated space. The employee VERY happily obliged. He called another employee and between the both of them cleared out the soiled dishes, and set the table up for us within couple of minutes. *Claps* Each family in our group ordered individually, took our token and seated ourselves. Food was brought to us in the order that we had ordered. We waited at the maximum 5 Minute for the entire party to have something to get started. Employees in general were hustling like there was no tomorrow. Every staff member was enthusiastic to be there, and was assisting any questions patrons might throw at them. Atmosphere:The place was bumbling with activity. I had a cafe kind of a vibe until I placed my order and sat down. From that moment on to the time we left, it felt like an authentic dine in Mexican restaurant. There is a lot of seating inside. It is good for small as well as large groups. Parking was a tad bit difficult as their own lot is rather small. However, there is plenty of parking on the street. Food: I ordered a Mole Enchilada (~$13), Side of Steak (~$6) and a Horchata ($3). Mrs ordered a 2 item combo with Chile Relleno, Grilled Chicken Taco and 2 portions of Rice (~$13) \\xa0Mole was delicious. Horchata was very smooth. Steak was prepared well with spices and was not chewy at all. It was good quality meat. The Grilled Chicken Taco was VERY good. Ian had a good time devouring it in record time. \\xa0This is a must try restaurant for all you tourists visiting the SB area!'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Stopped in here for lunch during a day trip to SB. We chose this place based on the reviews, and specifically for the mention of the queso fundido. We enjoyed it, but I understand why the reviews are mixed. Here\\'s what you need to know before going:The food IS great; very flavorful and unique and not just a standard Mexican food spot. My boyfriend called everything \"excellent\" and he\\'s not often free with praise for restaurants. I was very happy with both tacos i ordered, and it is worth noting they are a substantial size. When another reviewer said the tacos were art, I thought that meant they\\'ll be tasty but the size of a half dollar. Not so! They were very nice sized and i almost regretted ordering two since they were so filling. The queso fundido was not quite what we were expecting and they were out of chorizo for it, but it was definitely a take on queso I hadn\\'t experienced before. Service was a little wonky, so I get where some of the previously aired frustrations are coming from. We got 2 items almost right away, but then the rest was very staggered as they realized they were missing ingredients for some of the order, and entirely forgot about my 2nd taco until I brought it up. I will say all staff was very friendly and apologetic and the issues were resolved pretty fast. We were lucky to have found seating. That seems like it can be tricky and there are always other customers hovering waiting to take your seats. As such, maybe not the most relaxing dining but you just have to decide to take your time and enjoy your food, and kind of roll with the potential chaos. Again, everyone on staff was very helpful and nice. Maybe this place just needs a bigger space.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'I was excited to try this top rated place in SB however I was wholly underwhelmed for the price we paid. There was just nothing distinctive about the flavors - I couldn\\'t really put a finger on what it was missing, maybe salt or spices? It was just \"fresh\" but otherwise not that tasty or memorable. However, I did enjoy the salsa bar (regular and green sauces were the best). Presentation was great, food was okay, and service was extremely mediocre (they kept asking what our order was even tho we had a man order number on our table and waiters kept bumping into me and were not nice at all about it). Ordering also felt a bit like being at Chipotle - you get in a long line, then are rushed to order, they just swipe your credit card without a word, and you struggle try to find an open table. If I had to describe this place, I would say it was \"good\" - not worth going out of your way for.'},\n",

While I did find the dining rooms a bit cramped, it didn't seem to prevent patrons from filling up every available seat and enjoying their meal. The food is pricey for a Mexican restaurant, but that may largely have to do with the location (Santa Barbara CA is expensive). They start you off with warm tortilla chips and an unlimited variety of salads and sauces to choose from. For my meal, I picked the Enchiladas Suizas, which was loaded with green chili verde sauce and Swiss cheese. Beans in a taco shell and rice comes with the entree. Everything was delicious, and I especially liked how much chicken they loaded into the enchiladas. The spicy green sauce didn't have much spice at all (I wanted spicy). I give this place a 4-star because the chips, salsa variety, and food was good. The lack of much elbow room and the high pricing was a deterrent for me.\"},\n",

You might be wondering why cause of course, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants all over the area. The reason is cause of their unique sauces.They serve a complimentary basket of chips whenever you decided to dine in, so I tasted their salsas first. They have a guacamoleto, which is a better version of El Pollo Locos green avocado salsa. cause you can actually taste the avocado in it. They have a regular salsa chips as well, which tasted like a marinara blend found in Italian cuisine and it is unique/ creative/ taste so good. My girlfriend ordered their Agaves burrito, which is a seafood burrito consist of shrimp and fish. Their secret salsa sauce is smothered in the burrito. It is served with salad as well. I tasted it and I wanted to just grab it from her; that's how good this burrito is! \\xa0I, on the other hand, ordered their steak/ seafood sopes bowl; the best Mexican soup I ever had. The bowl is like a wizard just crafted this for me; the bowl looks like a cauldron of goodness. They serve it with corn tortilla, too.

It has a spicy kick into it, but I still keep on eating it. I don't like spicy food, but surprisingly I would eat this in a heartbeat.

We tried to come one night and the line was out the door so we came back the next night around 5PM to beat the rush and the line was still long but it dispersed quickly. I thought it would be a sit down meal with a server but you order at a counter and are given a number and people bring the food out to you as it's ready.The place didn't seem super clean, maybe because of all the foot traffic throughout the day, and there were only two bathrooms inside but one was out of order. There was a sign that said there were portable bathrooms outside for patrons to use which I actually should have tried because some lady was in the bathroom for, no lie, 20 minutes...I don't even want to know what that was about.Once we got the food, I wasn't that impressed to be honest. I find the Mexican food I get in Connecticut was just as good or better. Maybe I came here with the wrong expectations.\"},\n",

Every bite you bite into, you find large chunks of halibut or whole shrimp! They don't skimp on the shrimp! The sauce was spicy and thick and creamy. Yum! Oh, the side salad was also delicious! The yogurt dressing was so refreshing with the mini orange and cranberries. Loved it! Mojado Burrito: Wet burrito with steak: another amazing burrito! The steak was truly a steak! All the ingredients that went into the burrito was so fresh! The red sauce was not spicy but definitely added flavor to the burrito. This burrito is like a steak fajitas all wrapped up nicely for me! Again, fork and knife required. Loved! The salsa bar was plentiful! You got mild to spicy salsas! Onions, cilantro, and lime to add to your dishes. All orders come with a basket of chips! Yes, please!Horchata: sooo good! Tastes so...authentic? Yes yes, if I must say so. Hibiscus juice: too sweet. I'd skip it and get a Mexican soda instead!This is a quick sit down type of eatery. You order then find a table to sit. Don't be intimidated by the number of people in line or already sitting. There are plenty of spaces for everyone. Because of the nature of this eatery, people eat pretty fast so the turn around time for an open spot is also quick! Enjoy!!\"},\n",

The seafood enchilada was one of the best I've ever had - the tangy citrus salsa balanced the seafood perfectly. The fish along with the seafood gave it a nice heft and meatiness. I'd eat this all day, every day if I could. The tacos al pastor came with a good amount of meat, which was nice, but I found it a little too salty and a a little too sweet/one dimensional. The camarones guajillo was just okay. Great smoky flavor and the shrimp were large and fresh, but compared to the seafood enchilada, this couldn't compare. Overall, get the seafood enchilada, that alone is worth the trip.\"},\n",

I watched four large tables being held by 2 children and 1 adult while the rest of their party waited at the end of a very long and slow line, while those who had already ordered and we're looking for a table we're not able to be seated. Had waitstaff intervened others could've eaten and left by the time the larger parties food was ready.\"},\n",

It is located off the tourist path on Milpas. The food is pricey for a casual dining experience, and the food is mediocre at best. The service is probably the worst in Santa Barbara. I had to hunt down my server for everything...even the bill! Even then, I had to wait by the front cashier for about 10 minutes to get the bill, and the server was rude. You have plenty of other choices for Mexican food in Santa Barbara , you would be better off eating somewhere else. I would have given Los Agaves ZERO STARS, but it is not an option.'},\n",

The shrimp diablo and the chicken fajitas were good. I really enjoyed their rice I actually loved their rice, very soft and very flavorful. The fajitas were good but could have been a little more flavorful but overall good especially when you mix it with the sour cream, lettuce, guacamole and tomatoes it comes nicely eith the tortillas.I definitely would come back and try their other stuff on the menu.

Like the kind of delicious that would make you want to buy buckets of this amazing stuff. I was curious but skeptical. Can salsa really be that good? Um, yeah...it can! He hyped it up...A LOT and it STILL lived up to the hype!What I didn\\'t expect was the variety. So when I got to the salsa bar, I asked him \"which one is the best one?\" and he said \"get all of them!\" Well shoot, here we go! bit.ly/1Lodg67My favorites were the chipotle one, the avocado salsa, the salsa verde, and the salsa negra. Habañero salsa was delicious too but WOO its spicy! :DAs much as I would love to say that we came here just for the salsa, we also ordered dinner entrées. I inquired about the Garden Burrito to find out if the rice is cooked in chicken stock and the gal behind the counter confirmed that it was. But then she took the extra initiative to inform me that the beans they typically serve are not vegan either but they do have vegan-friendly beans. She made sure that it was used in my burrito. Then offered me extra beans on the side in lieu of the rice. So helpful! I appreciate it when employees go above and beyond :) We also nixed all the dairy ingredients. This burrito was HUGE!!! Filled with grilled zucchini, green and red bell peppers and beans. It also had lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo on the side. bit.ly/1KJ9euNTrust me when I say that I covered every bite with so much delicious salsa!

       "  'review': \"I will give this 5 stars. Yes.So online, there were a few reviews that recommended another place (not Yelp) that was really closeby, another Mexican place. Me, just being on Yelp, found Los Agaves on the Top 3 for Santa Barbara. So I was like...let's go to both places!This place was the clear winner. Seriously.Agaves burrito ($13.50)- Fresh halibut and shrimp, roasted red peppers, onions, Monterey Jackcheese, lettuce,guac, topped w/ chipotle sauce. Served w/ rice, lettuce, sour cream, guac, and pico de gallo. And an amazing salad.Burrito mojado ($10.95)-Wet burrito w/ grilled chicken or steak, pinto beans and queso fresco topped with salsa roja. With salad and rice, lettuce sour cream, guac, pico de gallo.They bring a bag of chips that you can eat and nibble at first. (Sauce is on the side)With agaves burrito- the salad was amazing. There was a mango and balsamic addition which was made by them. Tasted amazing with mixed greens. It was really really good. :O It was a little bit spicy for someone who can't handle at all, but even if you can handle a little... it's okay. The shrimp and halibut crunched in our mouths. Omg so good.Burrito mojado- the wet burrito was really interesting, At first- how do I hold it? Use a fork. Makes life easier. It was muy delish! The steak was really moist and the sour cream and guac on the outside was an excellent addition to it. OH so good MUST TRY. 10/10They have a lot of sauces on the side that you can try and add. Mild, medium, hot, and mas!Oh dear god I was so glad we came here first. When I have a chance to write another review, I'll write about the next taco place we ate at.PLUS 2 burritos make 4 people full. :OWe're still talking about the agaves salad. SO GOOD\"},\n",

Like a fool, i forgot my purse and drove back home to LA without noticing. I called and they graciously had my purse with everything in it the next day.

The food was authentic but served western style. This is probably the first place I was served enchiladas with rice and salad. Usually the sides would be pinto beans or retried beans with rice but here it was salad. The dressing used in the salad was bomb. It was amazing. The halibut & shrimp with peppers and onion filled enchiladas with chipotle sauce topping was perfect. The food was fresh and hot. The spice level was moderate and wasn't like fire. This allowed for the taste buds to realize other taste in the food. The salsa bar was of wide choices and freshly made. Will visit this place again.

They made her get up since we had not put in our order yet... Seriously! They didn't heck in on us after the food was delivered, one of the meals was incorrectly delivered and the waiter spoke no English so I had to point to the menu to tell him what our other meal was...

I thought it was pretty good but not hot enough. Weird. Then I tried my husband's burrito and it was good but also a bit on the cold side. The flavors were wonderful as always but the temperature off on both. On our return trip we decided to stop in again (3days later) and this time I was starving! My hubby ordered his usual burrito and I got the Agave burrito with shrimp and fish. Cold again. This burrito has always been my favorite. I love the sauce and chunks of shrimp but there was so much cold guacamole that the whole burrito was cold. My husband's burrito was better. I hope it was just a fluke. I still gave 4 stars for flavors and service. I don't want to give up on this place so we'll be back but I hope I get a hot meal.\"},\n",

Great mole, great molcajete, more than enough nachos, grande burritos, chile verde are among the best here. But the list goes on. It's not a sit down order kind of restaurant but the inside is just with authentic Mexican ambiance. They have enough great choice of beer just wish their agave margaritas can come in pitchers order. Great tasting indeed but small glass it comes in. Friendly cashiers, overall staff seems always in a rush to keep up with serving food fast enough to get you out for patrons waiting always to get and find seating after order.

Anyway, we waited in line and ironically the man in front of us also asked for vegetarian food at the counter and we over heard the waitress telling him that all the enchilada sauces and salsa's also are cooked in meat? We weren't sure what to make of this situation so we ended up leaving the line and going to another restaurant because we did not want to risk it.

Also, they have amazing varieties of Salsa. Food gets prepared pretty quickly but lines can be quite long during peak lunch and dinner time. I usually call and order ahead of time so that it's ready when I get there (usually only takes 15-20 mins for them to prepare). Great ambiance and probably one of the best restaurants in town.The servers that work there are quick, attentive and efficient.\"},\n",

The flavor were perfect and the portions are very generous. Oh yeah.. the rice was SO good. I normally don't eat too much of the rice but it was so well seasoned. It was just perfect! The sauce bar also had a great selection! The agave margarita was good too :) Service: I don't mind the idea of ordering at the counter and then finding a seat.

It's popular for good reasons!The food is cooked with love and lots of flavor! Did I mention the huge portions already? We could have easily shared one meal but went overboard and ordered way too much food. The hard potato taco was packed with flavor and the chile relleno filled with Monterey jack cheese and topped with salsa roja, sour cream and queso fresco was outstanding. And then the Plato Placero de Arrachera which is a fun way to make your own tacos came with chopped tender steak, melted cheese, grilled chorizo & nopal along with pinto beans and guacamole. So much food! But everything was on the money. We also had agave and blood orange margaritas and both were great. You order your food first, then grab your drinks, sauces and sides. Then you'll be seated by one of the many employees who are working non-stop to make sure everything keeps moving. This place is a well oiled machine!\"},\n",

Servers dropping food off knocking into our table as they walked by.There were four of us and all four entrées came at completely different times. My wife's meal which I think they actually forgot to make until we complained arrived a good 20 minutes after all the other food.Lots of potential here with this place doesn't know what it wants to be, a nice restaurant or a fast food joint.\"},\n",

The sides that came with the tacos... rice OMG what a delicious rice, so puffy! \\xa0The salad was good as well.Cons:Thankfully my friend were sharing the salad and the baja tacos, had we not, one of us would have had to wait for their food for an additional 20 minutes, I'm \\xa0sure there was a flaw there, as other order were coming out faster than ours even if the clients showed up after us. \\xa0Again, we had a chance to finish our salad, but I wanted to take a bite of each. \\xa0The agave wine maragritas: They were a bit salty, almost too salty to drink. \\xa0I wonder if this is always the case, because if it wouldn't have been for the saltiness it would have been super amazing.

It's this boiling pot or in Spanish called a Molcajetes (imagine that) with this great sauce and chilies and other good stuff in it.

We came here because our friend suggested it and were so so happy with the recommendation. There is street parking around the restaurant and the interior is pretty large - which worked in our favor. For a Saturday at brunch time, it was suprisingly not that busy. It's a casual spot; you order and pay at the counter and the staff then brings the food to your table. The chips/salsa bar were almost enough to fill me up before our food came.I had to try one of their signature molcajetes (which are served in a very large molcajete - aka a stone mortar bowl). I had a chicken molcajete (without the chorizo) and it was amazing. First of all, the portion size is HUGE; definitely enough to split between 2-3 people. The bowl was akin to a chicken stew; very flavorful, slightly spicy, and piping hot. It was served with three warm corn tortillas and so so delicious. My husband got the chilaquiles with verde sauce and scrambled eggs, and they were some of the most delicious chilaquiles I've had - this was also a very large portion. It came with breakfast potatoes and a side of beans in a cute little tortilla bowl.We were super happy with the food and service here, and will definitely come back on future trips to Santa Barbara!\"},\n",

The variety of sodas, beer, aguas frescas is refreshingly diverse. Menu items is deliciously extensive - Mole, nopales, al Pastor, chicken, carne asada, fish, shrimp, lamb, chile rellenos just to name a few and wet your appetite:))Service is wonderful from beginning to end. \\xa0Hector, Manager, is welcoming, and very pleasant. \\xa0It's nice to be greeted.

I've had most of their menu and I can tell you that you won't go wrong with any of the items you choose here. From their fajitas, chilli rellenos, green enchilladas to their amazing guac and sides!They have a buy one get one 50% off axxess deal which comes in handy, but even if I didn't have that I would come visit this restaurant many times over. The care they take in their service (fast food, always dropping by, water filling), make your experience here amazing. You order at the front and then take your number to your choice of table and are graced with delicious chips and salsa.The portions are big enough to fill you, flavorful, and have an authentic but healthy Mexican taste. I definitely recommend!Cheers,J\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"Great food, the weird thing is that the star of the show for me, wasn't the main event.After a day at the beach, my friends wanted to grab something to eat, so this place popped up on a yelp search. Located on a busy main street, be sure to find a good time to look for parking, because there isn't much around the place. It was a busy weekend when we went, so we parked a little far away, but it wasn't a big problem for us, but it can be for some.The restaurant itself has a nice feel about the atmosphere. It's not a usual taqueria you would find in the middle of the city, it has an old-time feel to it with nice cultural decorations that fill up the multiple rooms inside. The flow of the restaurant is a little awkward though. There's almost always a line for ordering food, so where we sat, it was a little cumbersome to move through the line to get fountain drinks and salsa, which is in the corner.This brings me to the point to why didn't give the place 5 stars, the salsa was the highlight of my visit. I took many trips to the salsa bar to grab more of the (chips) salsa, because it was that good. It's my favorite type, where it isn't chunky, and it tasted fresh. I even smothered my Burrito Mojado with the stuff. The burrito was okay, plenty to eat, but it wasn't as tasteful as some places I've had. A lot of the menu items are pretty expensive, expect to pay upwards of $7 or more for the bigger items. But I guess the quantity makes up for it.If I were in town, I'd definitely check this place out again to try more of the menu, and to get more of the salsa (with the complementary chips). Check this place out!\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"So I have never had a bad experience at Los Agaves until today. I had gone in a couple weeks ago and noticed they added an awesome looking happy hour from 2-5 mon to Thursday. So finally got a chance to check it out and we barely made it there by 4:45 pm. Just in time to order a couple awesome items.We get up to the counter and ask for nachos on the happy hour menu and they inform us for no reason they are not doing happy hour for that day.There are happy hour menus on surrounding tables, this is an advertised and public menu and for no reason say they are no longer doing happy hour.The best part is we are ordering just plain nachos, same ones on the main menu as the happy hour menu... so we want the same exact thing and they are telling us there's no happy hour.Well why are there posted menus everywhere advertising it?? And why can't you give us your advertised price of the happy hour nachos.For a restaurant that makes a ton of money, this is absurd. Also if you are an consistent repeat customer, asking for an advertised item on a menu displayed at the restaurant that you have in stock is ridiculous. So if your interested in checking out a happy hour, apparently for whatever reason the Los Agaves advertised happy hour from Monday to Thursday 2-5 \\xa0does not exist. So don't get stoked if your chillin at Los Agaves one day and see a sweet looking happy hour menu on your table. It's not real! It's all a lie. Now I'm left wondering if taco Tuesday still exists at Los Agaves. Sure don't want to show up and see if that's not really anymore.Lame, super duper lame.\"},\n",

I appreciate dishes like the seafood enchiladas with chipotle cream sauce paired with a green salad dressed in a complimenting balsamic redux and a subtle nuance of vanilla (according to my tastebuds). One star off because the ordering situation really lacked in many ways. You order up front and its a mess of people ducking and dodging one another to score a table. The salsas- while delicious, are not maintained frequently enough and disorderly for my taste. In my opinion, the lack of a table side server reduced the overall dining experience of an otherwise nice meal .\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'We were ridiculously surprised and happy with how amazing this place is! We came by back in December to see the place closed for the family being on vacation so we were kinda bummed but hey we made it back now and were extremely happy with our whole experience!The place sits on a corner with a small parking lot in the back, don\\'t expect to find parking there and opt for the street parking which allows 90 minute parking, plenty of time to eat.entering the restaurant we were hit with the crazy heat from the kitchen which is just behind the ordering counter, but luckily there is another dining room to sit which is much much cooler. at first we were looking up at the board thinking that was the menu, but then a cashier hands us menus to read in hand so we thought those were the same. that is, until i looked up again while ordering to see the items on the board were the \"specials\". ah well, next time we will take a better look at the menu board.we ordered three plates that you don\\'t normally find at a mexican restaurant, seems here they do more \"hard to come by\" menu items that don\\'t necessarily succumb to the gringo pallet. we also ordered horchatta which was cool, sweet, and smooth, as well as a pacifico beer. each of the salsa was also surprisingly flavorful! usually these spots have a bunch of salsas that either all taste the same or all you taste is spicy concoctions of chiles. BUT the salsas here each had their own unique and tasty flavor. we are so used to adding salsas to each of our meals we felt bad when all we used the salsa for were the chips and barely used any for the food itself. the first dish we ordered was the Tacos Plaza de Toros, which is three tacos each topped with steak, mexican chorizo, and chicharron, and a side of guacamole and salsa. initially i thought each taco would be a separate meat, i.e. one steak, one chorizo, one chicharron taco. BUT come to find out, each taco contains all three meats, which isn\\'t bad at all! the steak is tender and flavorful, slightly dry. the chorizo was also a little dry but had a great kick to the taco, and the chorizo was more like bread crumbs but piled on nicely atop each taco. the tortillas were soft and fresh, and the guacamole was absolutely delicious! i thought about adding salsa to the meats since they were kind of dry but then the flavor was still so good i didn\\'t want to ruin or change the flavor of the taco!the next dish we had was the Chile Nortenos which were two giant poblano chiles stuffed with monterey jack cheese and shrimp with a chipotle sauce. the chiles were huge and open face, tons of melty ooey gooey cheese, perfectly cooked shrimp all in a delicious chipotle sauce with a tortilla underneath it all! this was absolutely delicious, filling, comforting, and so so good! it came with a side salad and rice too which was hardly touched as the salad was kind of an odd side dish and the rice would just be wasted space in the stomach. but i did have \\xa0abite and the rice was good. our last dish was the Quesadilla de la Esquina. three puffy quesadillas stuffed with oaxacan cheese, poblano chiles, huitlacoche, sour cream and other herbs and spices. this also came with a big side of guacamole and salsa. The puffy quesadillas were warm, crispy, golden brown, the cheese was stuffed and loaded into each quesadilla, the veggies and other fillings were all delicious and covered in the delicious flavors and ooey gooey cheese! oh so good!at first you think this place is kind of expensive, but then when you actually see the plates, with how much food and how much guacamole, then all the salsas available, and then the quality and taste of the food, it is definitely worth it!! our meal was about $50 but not a single penny was wasted or thought to be overpriced. we will happily return and enjoy another meal!'},\n",

       "  'review': \"Woops I thought I already reviewed Los Agaves! I have now been here twice. I initially came here because of the tremendous reviews here on Yelp (Thanks, Yelp!). Los Agaves is a nice little Mexican restaurant located in the heart of Santa Barbara. There's actually quite a bit of competition for similar type foods down the street but it appears that this has really risen to the top!Los Agaves doesn't look like much on the outside but you can tell it's something by the number of cars parked on the outside. When you get in you are drawn to the long line of people ordering. Remember to order at the counter first then sit yourself down and bring your order number with you so they can serve you. The Mocajete is what people come here for which is a boiling lava rock pot of food that you can serve yourself in a corn tortilla that comes with the meal. Be careful of your white clothing! You can get stains from all the bubbling that happens! You can choose from several different types of meats and enjoy yourself!For those looking for something a little less messy, your tacos and burritos are great choices. Try the appetizer quesadilla zucchini flower. It's amazing and very tasty. The cheese they put in there is thick and they actually fry the tortilla before the fold it giving it great taste and texture. I always get the carne asada which is nicely cooked and then I flavor it with some great salsas that you can get at the salsa bar. They are quick and large portions. Probably a little more expensive than what you might expect from a food place like this but they make up for it by the quantity of food you get.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"With all the reviews, not sure mine matters much but here it is.Let me cut to the chase -- I ate here and had a fantastic meal. Then I came back twice driving a few miles from my hotel room.Apparently, after a delicious and healthy feeling meal, my wife had left her purse and sweater in a seat at the restaurant. I went back to ask for it and the staff was super friendly and yes, there they were.I returned to my hotel the hero and my wife's first question was if I got our daughter's sweatshirt. Ah ... This time, I called and they had that too. So back I went and they retrieved three of my family's items with no complaints.As for our meal visit, they're super popular and we had arrived before 6pm on a Saturday. By 6:00, the line was well out the door. When we were walking in, we noticed the local fire fighters were getting food to go (fire truck was outside) -- always a good sign when fire fighters or law enforcement dine at a place.You order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Even though it's counter service, the food is high end.Food came out super fast and it was delicious.I had two halibut tacos with rice which was delicious. My wife had a veggie tostada and daughter had a crispy chicken taco but mostly ate chips and guac.I can see why this place is popular. I really, really appreciate the staff for recovering my family's numerous misplaced personal items left behind. They were friendly and helpful all three times I was there.Parking is a challenge. The lot in back is small and there are some restrictions on neighborhood parking. It's so worth driving around looking for a space.Definitely going back next time I'm in SB. Already looking forward to it.\"},\n",

The line was out the door when we came and we had a toddler and a 4 year old, so we wanted to make sure we had a table. My husband asked a couple of the wait staff if we could sit on an empty table, unfortunately, they told us we had to order first. That was a bit annoying. When we got closer to the cashier, the same Asian lady we had asked told us she had a table ready for us. Excellent customer service, five stars for that alone. Then came the food. Fish tacos were absolutely delicious. Fish was crispy and lightly battered, tortilla was homemade, and portions are out of this world! You will definitely get your money's worth. I had a taste of hubby's lengua, and it was melt in your mouth superblicious! I didn't taste any gamey-ness at all. My toddler loved the chips and salsa. The chicken quesadilla was filled with loads of grilled chicken and cheese. We had a great experience here. The wait was worth it!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I definitely don\\'t see myself ever coming back here! Was in the neighborhood and with a group ready to have lunch... we were hungry and wanted to try someplace new in SB. Yelp lead us here... The reviews seemed great and we knew exactly where it was. Upon arrival it was packed- this usually indicates a good sign right ? Boy were we wrong. We ordered and then found a seat. Our drinks arrived to the table and they were great! (This is why and the only reason I\\'m giving one star). I had the Michelada which was perfect. Then came the dishes ... this is where things went south, fast. I had the los agaves sea food burrito. It sounded amazing. Too bad not ONE piece of sea food in the cold burrito drenched in some strange sauce. The tortilla was soggy and was too messy to pick up while the knife they provided wasn\\'t sharp enough to cut into it either. Then finally once I did manage to cut it in half I found nothing but wilted lettuce and veggies inside. Naturally I let the waitress know and her reply ? \"Oh, I guess I\\'ll bring you another.\" I was shocked ! I let her know I was fine and would just share with my group and nibble off their dishes as it was almost time to go anyway and there was no point in waiting on another dish. As we got up I let the manager know of this experience and asked for a refund since I had not eaten a single bite of this over priced dish that was sent back. He thought I was a liar and questioned me before agreeing to cash out my refund. He said there should have been tons of sea food inside as this was the best seller on the menu. I replied, yeah and that\\'s why I ordered it! It sounded great but what was served to me fell very flat. I\\'m a fair person and i realize it could have been a mistake or one off in the kitchen. It happens. But what baffled and shocked me was the way this was handled....every single person in this restaurant had a horrible attitude and I then realized on our way out that the only reason it was busy was because of the college kids who filled the place up as their near by study/ lunch spot. Will never return nor will I recommend you visit here either. Not to mention the place was a bit of a dump. Very dirty tables and flies all over. Save your money go anywhere else on state street instead.'},\n",

I then went for just a salad with shrimp(he said the shrimp was not marinated in onion) and he also put an allergy to onions on my salad.Well when the salad came out, there was a piece of onion in it. I kindly told the server there was onion in it. She came back to the table and said \"they said they didn\\'t put any onions it\\'s probably just one piece.\" I\\'m sure it might have been one piece but that\\'s enough to give me an allergic reaction. Almost making me feel as if this was a preference and not a food hypersensitivity. I asked for a new one, hoping they would take better caution. Some time came, a new one came out and sure enough.. more onions! (See attached photo, there were more through out the salad)I am very disappointed in this place.

I ordered 2 soft taco\\'s carne asada & pollo & they were packed with ALOT of meat & I got it with a side house salad. The salad had cranberries & mangos. Boy, that was my favorite. I\\'d prolly order it as a entree for something light. Taco meat was made perfectly BC it wasn\\'t dry it was tender. Chilli renello with el pastor. It was a huge chilli & good quality cheese. The taste was full of flavor & fresh. It\\'s a causal but elegant place. It is listed as \"Yelp top places to eat in 2016\"Chips are complimentary & fresh salsa bar. With roasted chili, avocado & more chilli salsas. Super delicious. This was my birthday dinner :) Good service :) thanks'},\n",

You order at the counter, and then you either find a seat if it's slow or you'll be directed to a seat if it's busy (it usually is). They bring you chips, and they have a really expansive salsa bar. There are milder ones like pico de gallo, and also spicier ones with roasted peppers. They're all really tasty.I've had their breakfast and really enjoyed it, but I prefer lunch/dinner. The Agaves Enchiladas have a chipotle sauce that is DIVINE. Also, the dressing they use on the salad that the give you as a side is amazing.Come towards the beginning of the day to avoid the rush, or just get it delivered!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'My boyfriend and I were on our way back from a road trip and yelped for local restaurants. After reading a couple outstanding reviews my boyfriend had to try it as we are big \"fucking Frisco foodies\". I personally took the reviews with a grain of salt being from Oakland /SF and half Mexican. I know good Mexican food. We got there and ordered the recommended plates and holy testicle Tuesday! The food was ugh drool. The presentation was drool. The smell was drool. I\\'m drooling just thinking about it. I ordered the land and sea dish which was served in a big molcajete. They are not stingy with their meat I tell you. It had fish,shrimp, beef, chicken, clams cooked to unison perfection in a thick soup sauce. The tenderness in the beef. The snap in the shrimp. Even the cactus was perfection! And the fresh gordita tortillas... I can\\'t. Food orgasma! My boyfriend kept sampling my dish. My boyfriend ordered the Agave burrito. The creamy special sauce... I think I just wet myself thinking about it. Everything inside cooked to perfection. And the salad that came with it... Ugh drool. I\\'m a big salad person. Usually Mexican restaurants suck at salads. You usually get some chunks of iceberg with a couple slices of tomatoes MY PEOPLE, THAT IS NOT A SALAD. \\xa0But this place; tangerine, mango bites, romaine lettuce drizzled with some fucking fantastic magical mango dressing and fetta cheese. NOW THAT\\'S A SALAD. And if that wasn\\'t enough, the service was unhumanly kind! They ask if you want more chips with a genuine smile. Are you guys food angels?! Am I in food heaven?! (The salsa for the chips were good too)Their courtesy made me want to eat more. It was clean in there too, even the bathroom! \\xa0Definitely worthy of all its great reviews.

       "  'review': 'While researching restaurants to try in Santa Barbara, Los Agaves appeared in nearly every local food blog and dining magazine. It was even recommended to me by the hotel that I stayed at as a \"must try\". Just about everyone in town knows about this place I guess. I was not surprised to see that this eatery has the most Yelp reports written in the SB area. When I entered the restaurant, I found the dining area to be very open and casual. Customers would order at the counter and then find a table to sit. The system reminded me of fast food service. There were many tourists and foreigners.Los Agaves\\' menu was unofficially split into two sections: \"specials\" and \"boring items\", the latter including burritos, salads, and quesadillas. It would be a waste of time to come order them, so I selected two specials from the black board, the molcajete and cochinita pibil. Neither of these dishes are native to Guadalajara, which is where the chef-owners are from, but the chefs at Los Agaves appear to be talented enough to cook food from other regions of Mexico in order to label them as house special items.When the food arrived, I thought that cooking and execution of the dishes were elevated to a totally different level than expected. Everything exceeded expectations.Land and sea molcajete was truly heaven on earth. Every element of the Oaxacan style molcajete was absolute perfection, from the extremely blend of spicy tomato base to the fresh ingredients such as grilled nopales, queso fresco, chorizo, fish, and scallops. The steaming hot salsa base was extremely flavorful and versatile enough to pair with every single meat in the molcajete. What pushed this dish over the top was the inclusion of homemade corn tortillas. The tortillas were thicker, more hydrated, less crumbly, and had more flavor than the store bought packaged versions. You can\\'t eat the molcajete without these fresh tortillas.The other dish we ordered, cochinita pibil, is a traditional delicacy of Yucatán and common to find in Cancun. Despite the use of whole spices in this dish, it was significantly less spicy compared to the molcajete. The cochinita pibil featured pork shoulder meat that tore apart effortlessly and had somewhat crispy edges (texture somewhat like pulled pork). The meat was drenched in a pool of thick citrus-earthy sauce that had an addictive flavor. The inclusion of pickled onions in an interesting pink-purple hue not only added color but brightened up the overall flavor profile. On the side, creamy black beans and a very spicy grainy salsa accompanied the meaty cochinita pibil. I could not stop eating the pork and beans in the supplied tortillas, so I had to order a second round of homemade tortilla. The combination was that good!Finally, I have to mention that the 6 salsas available at the salsa bar were all exceptionally complex. Each salsa had a distinct flavor and spice level. The variety was several notches higher than all the salsas I\\'ve tried at Mexican restaurants in LA. My favorite type was a red, thin, mild one that had strong roasted and slightly bitter flavor. It reminded me of the taste of a mole I had before, and it was great with chips. \\xa0Perhaps the main reason why the food at Los Agaves is so addictive is because the chefs use natural ingredients, nothing from cans, and everything from the salsas to tortillas are prepared daily from scratch. The meal tasted like something a Mexican grandma would serve at home. Los Agaves will definitely be my first stop the next time I return to Santa Barbara.'},\n",

There was a long line when we got there at around 12:45 pm. At first, I thought we have to put our name to be seated, but it turns out, you stand in line to order. Once you placed your order and paid, you look around the restaurant for an empty table. The staff is very good at finding you a table, so no need to worry while you're still waiting for your food and there's still no table available... you'll get one before your food arrives. Now with the food, we ordered ceviche, one item combination with soft steak taco for me, my hubby got the steak plate and my daughter got the plain burrito. Everything was good. We did not expect the ceviche to be big, but it was big and we have to get it boxed so we could eat it while on the road. My daughter's burrito was huge, so we have to box that as well, and she had it for lunch the next day. My steak taco had a lot of meat in it,and once you put some salsa from their salsa bar, it was perfect, plus the rice and beans were tasty. Hubby killed all his food before i finished mine, so that just tells me that he enjoyed it. I'm so glad we went to this place because we had a wonderful lunch.\"},\n",

(I recommend green salsa from their salsa bar)The atmosphere of the restaurant was good but it was kind of too noisy for me. The only thing I did not like about the restaurant is their restroom. They only have a restroom for a person in the restaurant, so I had to wait for so long (they have one more outside, but that one was smelly and dirty that I did not want to use it)'},\n",

This says alot as we live in Oxnard which has pleanty of authentic mexican restaurants. We opted to try something different this time and ordered a molcajete, one of their specialties. We ordered the sea and earth, which came with shrimp, chicken, steak, chirizo, and fish. This dish was packed with flavor! Very glad we ordered it.We also shared a ceviche tostada which was great. Very fresh! Their Micheladas are also very good, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to micheladas....This place is always busy, so expect a line. It moves at a good pace though so before you know it, you will have made your order and found a table. Trust me, the wait is worth it.We will be back again and again!\"},\n",

A counter where you order your food yourself, but with waiters who take care of you and ask you if everything was ok. I liked it. They had a huge choice of food and for me a bit over average priced. But then I realized why. The food was massive. I had a Burrito that was the thickest I have ever seen. One dish could feed two people. My friend had sopes and the toppings completely covered them so you could only see the topping and no more sopes. At the same time it made feel like they wanted you to get full instead of eating good food. I couldnt sleep that night and my belly was grumbling from all the beans. Still, quite recommendable if you have a large tummy. I also suggest not to have late dinner there.'},\n",

I wish they had labels saying which one was which. Because of the lack of labels, we ended up getting one of everything. Different textures (smooth and silky to chunky) and spiciness. Basket of chips are refillable! Don't be shy! The beef in the crispy taco was not the ground beef variety bit rather the shredded beef. Both that and the chili releno were packed with flavor. I loved the presentation of the beans which were in a tostada shell (no cup necessary!), but my favorite part of the dish was the Mexican rice. Usu I'm not much of a fan of Mexican rice, but theirs actually had more flavors that blended well together.Service: You order at the counter and seat yourself. The tables and chairs are so close together. You are literally just about back to back to the next table. This is def not the place if you want some wiggle room unless you come in when it's not packed (which was actually rare during the 2hrs we spent there).Price: 2 combo with a small drink was $13.50 (tax included). With the portion sizes you get, this place is super reasonable. You are belt loosening stuffed at the end of the meal.Bottom line: Go here for your Santa Barbara Mexican food fix!\"},\n",

I didn't find one I was super in love with, but that's probably because five people were elbowing me out of the way as soon as I got front and center. The food itself was probably the best Mexicanish food I've had. It's not hole-in-the-wall, so it's not the same authenticity. But for what it is, I loved it. The green enchiladas were really good, and my boyfriend loved his nachos, although there were so many they got soggy quickly in the car. Los Agaves, I may live in LA, but I'll be back soon!

       "  'review': \"This place is NO JOKE. I thought that the reviews might be exaggerating a little bit, but they are not. Los Agaves has some of the absolute BEST Mexican food I have ever had in my life, and I grew up in Southern Texas, have been to Mexico many times, and my parents live in Southern California. If I lived in Santa Barbara (which unfortunately I don't...), I would be here every week.You order at the counter, then get a number to go find a seat and wait for your food. The line to order was a little long, but it moved quickly. We were behind another out-of-town couple who said they come here literally every time they're in Santa Barbara because it's that good. By the time we made it up to the counter, I was so excited! My husband ordered the chimichanga and I got the chicken mole enchiladas. By the time we got our drinks, picked up a few salsas, and grabbed a table, we already had a waiter bringing over chips. And literally, 5 minutes later, we got our food! I couldn't believe how fast the food service was. First of all, the salsa bar is not to be passed up...I was very impressed with all of their salsas, especially the verde avocado one (sorry I can't remember the name). Our food definitely lived up to the hype. My chicken mole was absolutely fantastic, and a mole is not easy to make. My chicken was cooked well, the mole was well-balanced, and even the sides (rice and beans) were tasty! And the servings were very generous. I would definitely come here again!\"},\n",

(He would have preferred less sauce on top of the burrito, but it was good and he was able to scrape off the excess).

What we ordered:- Tacos Baja: 2 fish or 2 shrimp tacos. I asked for 1 of each. If you are a fan of fish tacos... THIS IS IT. Upon my first bite, I was in heaven. Both the fish and shrimp tacos were amazing. They are beer battered, so very crunchy. At the same time, really juicy. I still stare at my IG post of these tacos sometimes (pictured). - Agaves Enchiladas: Fresh halibut and shrimp enchiladas. They are NOT battered. Drenched in chipotle \\xa0sauce. It was really, really good. - Halibut Ceviche: really big portion; I didn't even get to try it bc I was busy devouring my fish and shrimp tacos, lol. But my dad and brother said it was good amd really fresh. They give an entire avacado, which is always nice since I love avacado.- Agaves margarita was really tasty!

       "  'review': \"This is a 4.5 star restaurant, but I'm giving it 4 stars as the sea and earth molcajete digests in my stomach while I type from the Los Agaves parking lot. Maybe the 3rd time will be the final charm, and I'll update the rating to 5. One thing is for sure, I'm definitely coming back, and bringing my friends...Why 4.5 stars? Well, the food is 5 stars for sure. This is no taco bell or cheap Mexican hole-in-the-wall. And you pay for what you get: most entrees start at $12 and the median is probably $13 or $14.I've had the molcajete and the wet burrito (mojado) and both were on point. Especially the molcajete, which Los Agaves is known for. It's a stew with different meats or seafood inside, that you eat with a spoon or dip tortillas into (they give you 3).When you walk in, you stand in line, order and pay at the register, and they give you a number to take back to your table. Be sure to visit the salsa bar and load up on the 6 or 7 types of salsa they have. And warning: the habanero is very hot, and may kill your taste buds for the coming meal. The food comes out pretty quickly. I guess most of the staff is in the kitchen, making that food delicious and served quick.By now you must be thinking that this place sounds pretty perfect. And it almost, almost is. So what could have gone wrong?I've been here twice this week. The first time, I had the burrito mojado, and was 3/4 finished with it when I decided to go the restroom. When I came back my plate was being spirited away. Now, I'm not one to eat trash, but you never, ever take my food before I'm done. It's one of my biggest pet peeves. At least err on the side of caution: if there is even a crumb left on the plate, wait for the OK from the customer to take it away.I felt like a fatty, or like George Costanza eating out of the trash, when I asked for my unfinished burrito back. And that didn't feel good. Minus one star.The second time, which was tonight, it again almost went perfectly. The molcajete, sea and earth, includes a healthy amount of meat and seafood, enough for any bodybuilder. Not only that but I devoured the three tortillas very quickly, and, needing more to dip into the remaining meat and sauce, asked the kind 6'0 blonde manager for more. He got me 3 more, even though the kitchen was closed. By the way, the blonde manager deserves mentioning, because he does a great customer service job, making sure everyone is happy.But I have to mention that when I stepped up to order, the cashier, who had actually beckoned me to come up, was distracted, and barely acknowledged me. It took her a good 4-5 seconds to actually look my way. She was talking to someone in the kitchen. Why she chose that moment, after acknowledging my presence, was baffling and unprofessional. So that didn't feel good. After I ordered, she didn't give me my receipt or the table number. I had to remind her and ask for the receipt out of her hands. It was probably a minor slip-up, as it was late at night and the restaurant was winding down.But the details matter if I'm going to give you 5 stars, and when the prices can run $15 for one person (my meal: sea and earth molcajete and a beer, ran $22).Finally, the last slip-up which doomed (hyperbole much?) Los Agaves to 4 stars, happened, literally, as I was debating whether to give 4 or 5 stars. I was eating the last 1/4 bowl of my tortilla chips, because I'm a fatty like that, when the busboy started taking away the chips mid-bite! Seriously guys, take a second and see if I'm still eating something before you take it away. Give it like 10 seconds at least, or at least ask me. Never, ever take someone's food before they're done! You can ruin someone's entire dining experience that way.Still, the food is so good that I'll be returning a 3rd time to try the other menu offerings. And hopefully by then they'll have fixed their service blemishes.\"},\n",

I got my Granny a gringa al pastor and got a quesadilla ...said my food was sent out to another table without offering any apology. ..person checking food should be trained to perform with better skills...I would have given a 3 stars at least but Manager should have known how to fix a simple customer complaint.

I ordered the seafood tacos (one mahi mahi and one shrimp) and my husband ordered the ceviche. The seafood tacos were delicious. I recommend ordering just the shrimp as they were juicy and more flavorful than the mahi mahi. They aren't puny little shrimps but nice big tiger/prawn size.

You order at the counter and then find a seat, so they don't take reservations, but they were nice enough to gather several tables together for our large party.Food: I ordered the Los Agaves salad with chicken and dressing on the side. The chicken was delicious! Flavorful and very moist! Probably one of the best places for chicken ever. The salad itself was also tasty! They gave us chips and they have a pretty good salsa bar. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food also. Drinks: A good majority of the girls ordered margaritas to go with their meal, but we ended up with a couple extra being delivered to our table! Oh well, the more the merrier! Apparently they make them right out there, fresh each time and they are tasty!Would I return? Most definitely if I'm in the area and wanting Mexican food!\"},\n",

We ordered our dishes with no cheese coming in, but they put it in regardless which caused a mix up in the dishes. However, it didn't seem to increase the wait time. The dishes came out extremely quickly, and the place definitely does a good job on combining fresh food with traditional Mexican cuisine.\"},\n",

It's a cute restaurant with several tables inside. There were couples, families, small groups and large groups eating here.Don't be intimidated by the really long line of people. The line moves pretty quickly. The way this place works is you wait in line, order your food, then the waiters/waitresses will help you find a table for your group/party, and they'll bring your food quickly to you.What we ordered:*Agaves Enchiladas - Amazing! These enchiladas were filled with shrimp and halibut and covered in a chipotle sauce. It came with a side of salad dressed with a mango dressing. *Enchiladas Suizas - Very tasty! Nicely grilled chicken with lots of cheese. The rice and beans were well done too!*Horchata - The perfect drink with the meal! We waited 30 minutes for freshly homemade horchata and it was worth it!Service was awesome! There are several parking spaces in the back. But there also seemed to be ample parking on the street in the residential areas.Overall, I was impressed with the amazing service, the quality of the food, and how quickly everything came out.

Came here during me and my boyfriend's vacation to Santa Barbara because I found out it was one of the Top 100 Places To Eat on Yelp for 2014. The Yelp Elite in me HAD to check it out!PARKING:Kinda rough. They have a VERY small parking lot that holds MAYBE ten cars. We were SO lucky and found one spot! Other than that, just neighbor/street parking. Very narrow streets..AMBIANCE:Pretty standard Mexican restaurant. We entered through the back door so it didn't seem that crowded at first... There were a lot of different rooms/eating areas/tables, which was great. However, there's the main front area where the line and kitchen are, and that area was SUPER crowded. The line takes up the majority of the space and nearly backed up outside. It was super noisy in that area, but in the other eating areas it was relatively quiet. You order at the counter, and then they give you a number and you sit wherever you like. I was really disappointed because I read on Yelp about a dish I REALLY wanted to try, and then when we got there they didn't have it! Such a bummer! I ended up getting steak quesadillas, and my bf got the wet burrito. Prices were pretty average with most sit down Mexican places. FOOD:Food was good, but not MINDBLOWINGLY good. My quesadillas were very delicious, but I've had some that tasted exactly like these at other places. It was yummy but nothing set it apart from other quesadillas I've had elsewhere. My boyfriend got the wet burrito which thought was very good and enjoyed a lot.Overall, I did like my food, I just didn't see why this place made the list for one of the Top 100 Places To Eat. It was on par with other Mexican restaurants I like, but nothing that made it unique or special.\"},\n",

Also tried a sample of a friend's nachos and they were very good as well. Prices were reasonable given the portion size. Service was a bit of a letdown (not overly friendly, forgot to bring out another friend's entree). That's the only thing keeping it from being 5*. The place certainly met the hype.

The warm spiced stew was pretty wonderful-It's like cioppino but better! =) (big enough for 2 ppl)Ceviche was so fresh. It came in this huge plate, almost like a salad. WOW!

       "  'review': \"I was super excited about trying this place but was not so excited about the subpar customer service. First, you order/pay at the front and then are taken to your table with a number. But besides getting your food out to you, the staff is not too attentive to your needs. They forgot to give my boyfriend the side dish that came with his fajitas and it took about 10 minutes to get their attention. It then took another 5 minutes since we had to ask two different people- the first one had forgotten about us. In that time I just started eating my food because I was hungry and my food was getting cold (but I did share!). Besides the service, the food was good, but maybe not quite as good as I expected a 4.5 star restaurant to be. -Baja tacos ($14): I loved the sauce and corn tortilla. But the fish and shrimp were a little too fried for my liking. -Steak fajitas ($16): the steak was more on the well-done side. Tough/chewy. One highlight was the complimentary chips. These were fresh and crisp, and their salsa bar is pretty great with a variety of different salsa, as well as lime, onion, cilantro, and pico de gallo. As for other things: -wait: we came on a Saturday for lunch and waited about 20 minutes. Line was to the door but went fast. -parking: street parking all around the block. -price: on the steep side for Mexican food. I'm not sure that with my experience I would come back. I think I'll stick to LA's cheap and casual Mexican food.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"This place has been a go-to since it opened nearly a decade ago. The staff has always been polite and helpful, and the gradual expansion and upgrade of the dining space are great!I recently had the mole (mo-leh, not mole like the rodent) chicken enchiladas (with rice and beans), and chicken taquitos as an appetizer. The food quality is top notch--clean, fresh, with an appetizing presentation. There really is nothing quite like seeing enchiladas doused and buried in the darkness of the mole. The taquitos were a pleasant golden crisp, not undercooked, not over-fried. Important note: the complimentary chips and salsa are standard here--not every Mexican restaurant offers this, thankfully Los Agaves does. The food left me wanting. You can definitely notice the attention that goes into the preparation, but the flavors weren't as strong as I would have liked. It may just be my taste, but I wanted a stronger flavor to the mole and instead got something a bit bland. I also notice when restaurants use dairy-based additions (cheese, creams, etc) to supplement for food flavor, and cheese covered my beans, rice, and taquitos, which wasn't necessary. It didn't give me a chance to taste the different parts of my meal, and ends up offering up a salty flavor. None of that is necessarily bad depending on what you expect. But for the prices at the Santa Barbara locations, I'd want a bit more than atmosphere--I want great Mexican food, which isn't expensive to make.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"The appeal of Los Agaves isn't just the standard menu, though everything on it tastes very good. It's the specials board, with incredible and unexpected dishes like chile en nogada. And the specialties, like Molcajetes (bubbling hot-pot action!) and mole. The beef here is better than most (try the Tampiquena if you're extra hungry). The salads are pretty good too, though I got weirdly rubbery chicken on mine a couple of times.Brace yourself because the place can be busy (especially the Milpas location) and you order at the counter even though it's a sit-down restaurant.\"},\n",

You will always find a table so don't worry about that. If you grab a table before ordering you will throw off the whole flow. The avocado salsa is spicy and has great flavor. The salmon tacos are amazing. Homemade corn totillas and good quality salmon topped with mango and a spicy sauce. Served with rice and a salad with the best mango salad dressing. So good we ordered the salad dressing to use for the salad at our wedding. If your really hungry AND have someone to SHARE your meal with, get the nachos! They are huge and piled high with yummyness! No matter how hungry you are, share them. There will still be leftovers.\"},\n",

Maybe it's because we're not used to eating such large portions. I gave them 4 stars, because the customer service lacked a bit, especially from the older cashier lady.\"},\n",

You walk up to the counter and order your food. Once your food is ordered, you take your number and find your seat or an employee will assist you.

While it's been 4 years since my last visit to Los Agaves, the food was just as delicious as I remembered. Being from California, I've had my share of Mexican food but I can honestly say that this has to be my absolute favorite. They were in the midst of remodel so the place was a bit cramped but some food this good - who cares? The only reason didn't rate them a five is for two reasons. #1 The order taker at the counter was sooooo unfriendly. I observed his interaction with the customers in front of me and after me just to make sure it want just me. He didn't say hello or greet me in any way. I just got the blank look until I just started to place my order. He told me my total, I paid - again, no response or even a thank you. Wow. Ok, but the food is good. A guy who appeared to be either the owner or manager was working the room clearing tables. He stopped by and asked how our meal was with a warm smile. The guy at the counter should take a lesson from him. #2 Not enough seating. Hurry up with the remodel of the second room already!\"},\n",
