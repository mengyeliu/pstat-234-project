4/11/2021,"San Francisco, CA",so I forgot to take pictures except for the first plate they brought out but that just tells you how good the food is. I came by on a lovely sunny Santa Barbara sunday around 3 PM. they said it'd be around 45 minutes for a wait and it was a little less. We walked around and sat at the beach while waiting so the time passed quickly. they have both outdoor and indoor seating during COVID and a hand sanitizer bottle on the table. the bottle is unlabeled so we thought it might've been something else but nope.. hand sanny! garlic baked clams: (4/5) I've never had baked clams so I didn't know what to expect but it was pretty delicious! seasoned super well and it has some bacon on top. it doesn't really taste like clams to meclam chowder: (5/5) we got a free cup of chowder with the seafood pasta we ordered. it came out nice and hot. I thought the cup wouldn't be enough but that wasn't the case. flavored really well!!fish and chips: (5/5) the fish was SO nice and moist and the breading was really light (almost like a tempura). It didn't taste too oily or heavy at all which I appreciated! I would for sure order this every timeseafood pasta: (4/5) comes with quite a bit of cheese grated on top. the seafood pasta has scallops and shrimp but I felt it didn't have enough seafood in comparison to the pasta. It had good flavor but maybe a bit undersalted? overall I just felt myself wanting a bit more flavor but I loved it nonethelessrice pilaf: (1/5) you get a side of either fries or rice with the seafood pasta and we opted for rice since the fish and chips came with fries. BIGGEST regret though. the rice was so bland and the texture was off...DEFINITELY get friesgreat service and great location. I love this place and I will treasure it forever. I just wish they had more seating because of the wait times,5 star rating,Stephanie N.
3/9/2021,"Berkeley, CA","This is the 3rd time I've come to Brophy's and I live in Nor Cal. I feel like that says a lot since the few times I've visited SB, I've gone to eat here. I really love the oyster Rockefeller and I've also tried the fish and chips before. The oysters are so creamy and cheesy with the right amount of lemon and onions. The clam chowder was so warm and buttery and had really big pieces of clam in it which I loved. We went on a Monday and our wait time was 30 mins, but waited 20. They are being really safe during COVID by spacing everyone out, cleaning the table down and wearing masks.",5 star rating,Francina O.
12/6/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","If you're in Santa Barbara, you have to come here for seafood!! Yes, they are open for outdoor dining and yes, there are heat lamps.They do have a bit of a wait so we got drinks nearby. The drinks here are decent but not as cheap or as good as the other place. First, I have to say the service was impeccable. Our waiter made sure we were well attended to and anticipated our needs before we even needed them! Also, he's got jokes! LolSo my friend had the blackened seabass and I had the shrimp scampi. We both got clam chowder and French fries as our sides.This clam chowder is really tasty. It's creamy and the seafood flavor is perfect and not overpowering. Drowned my bread in it and finished the whole bowl. Perfect for a cold night. Mmmmmm.My shrimp scampi was SOOO GOOD. It's a little on the pricey side but it is so worth it. The garlic butter is not overly buttery and it has the perfect amount of garlic in it. (Not going to lie we took the sauce home....) Just dip all the things in it! I wouldn't recommend getting rice pilaf as your side though cause that might be too buttery. The scampi was a 5/5!!!!I am definitely planning to come back here and have the same exact thing....I'm drooling just thinking about it....",5 star rating,Elayna N.
5/27/2021,"Solvang, CA","Brophys restaurant & clam bar is a must if you're local or visiting the Santa Barbara area expect weekday wait times 15-25 minutes weekends are a different story 30 mins plus but it's worth it.Hands down Cioppino, Hot Combo is a must. Seafood pasta is a hit here just like the famous Brophys New England Clam Chowder.Enjoy",5 star rating,Patrick D.

5/14/2021,"San Francisco, CA","Visiting SB for my birthday weekend and the receptionist at our hotel had recommended Brophy Bros, so we decided to give it a try! We were seated immediately inside after being told an outside table would be about a 20 minute wait, but quickly asked our server if we could relocate to a table outside as we saw a party leave. They immediately moved us with no issue and I'm so glad we asked! The view from our table was beautiful- you could gaze out at the entire harbor. Our server, Mason, took really good care of us. His service was absolutely perfect and the food matched! My salmon dinner entree was delicious. Will absolutely come back next time I visit SB!",5 star rating,Rachel S.
5/16/2021,"Inglewood, CA","Love this place  so much! Been coming for years. I went by myself , so I think I was able to get seated quickly. Great view outside look at the boats. I love their fish and chips. I came to SB for dinner from LA, knowing I would come.",4 star rating,Tiffany W.
5/28/2021,"Hawthorne, CA","The food was pretty good. We got clam chowder, oysters rockefeller and a bacon cheese burger....all for a fair price. We left happy and full..with a few dollars left in our pockets. Bottom line, I will be back",4 star rating,Tiffany J.
3/21/2021,"Valencia, CA","First Time in Santa Barbara and I looked up the best fish n chips and was directed to Brophy Bros!  It is located right on the Harbor and the Setting is beautiful. You can look out and see all the boats in the harbor as you eat your meal. We sat inside though, because it was a little too windy to sit outside but it's still really nice inside.My girlfriend and I decided we were going to try some new things so we ordered the garlic made clams, and the fried calamari. They both came out really quick. The calamari looked amazing it was all rings and it was seasoned and fried perfectly and tasted even better. Their tartar sauce and cocktail sauce are on point. I've never had garlic baked clams before but I can tell you I will definitely be having them again. It comes with six clams and they are cooked with Parmesan bread crumbs and bacon and oh man they are so good. I'm super glad I Tried them. My girlfriend got the clam chowder and salad and I of course got the fish and chips. We had about three different types of clam chowder this weekend and Brophy Bros was definitely the best out of all three. The clams are cooked perfectly and it had potatoes and it was a beautifully creamy and delicious soup. Even the dressing for the salad was tasty.Now onto the fish and chips, it came with three very good size pieces and fries and I got a salad. The fish was nice and crusty and broke apart so easily and was beautifully white inside. Man it was definitely not a let down . SOOOOOOO GOOD !!! Flaky and scrumptious. I strongly recommend trying everything at this place because the 3 things we tried were on point and I couldn't get enough of any of it.  So if your in Santa Barbara , I have to tell you stop by Brophy Bros. You won't be disappointed . Our server was super friendly and awesome too. I can't remember her name though but she was great. It was an amazing around awesome experience !!",5 star rating,Ryan K.
5/5/2021,"Fountain Valley, CA","Stopped for lunch and got a perfect table to enjoy the view. Wonderful heat lamps kept us comfortable on a foggy cool day. We started with the calamari and sourdough bread and were quite happy with the freshness of both. Great precursor to a good lunch. We had their fabulous clam chowder with salad and tuna melts that were served with fries and slaw. The melts were a single sourdough slice piled high with tuna salad and cheese all melts on top. Edges were just a bit crispy from being under the broiler. French fries were cooked perfectly to our ""extra crispy"" request. Slaw was good too.  Our server was Juliet, and she was very sweet, efficient and attentive to our needs.  A definite place to return to.",5 star rating,Lisa M.
3/1/2021,"San Jose, CA","I was making a day trip to SB with my sister and we wanted to go to a place that had great seafood to eat! We both love raw oysters and clams so we decided to go to Brophy Bros because they seemed to have pretty much everything we wanted to eat there!We got seated very quickly and had a great view of the harbor. We really wanted to eat ASAP so we ordered a dozen half shelled raw oysters, the Hot Combo appetizer, the seafood pasta, and the Cioppino. The seafood pasta came with a side of Brophys New England Clam Chowder and some french fries. The Hot Combo consisted of smaller portions for most of the appetizers they offered like Oysters Rockefeller, Garlic Baked Clams, Steamed Clams, Steamed Mussels, and more!First off, the oysters were very fresh and sweet tasting. I had six to myself but was really tempted to get more to be honest! The Hot Combo was the perfect amount for us to just try all the appetizers without getting too full! Each component of the Hot Combo was made well and tasted amazing. The clam chowder had a good amount of thickness and great chunks of seafood in it, making it a nice plus since it comes with the meal.The seafood pasta was good. It was well made but honestly was not super special. I think definitely the appetizers here are the star of the show. The cioppino was great! They give you a good amount of mussels, clams, and other seafood and the broth was very refreshing.Definitely coming back next time I vacation here!",5 star rating,Caroline L.
2/2/2021,"Irvine, CA","First time here. Knowing Santa Barbara specialty is seafood, we searched on Yelp and decided to order from this restaurant. We got the fish+chips and seafood pasta to-go. Ordered through their website, found parking nearby (there's a sectioned off parking lot where you have to pay, but there's a neighboring lot that is free to park). Unfortunately, even with COVID, the area was super crowded. It didn't seem super clear whether our order was ready. My bf had to go into the store to ask for the update on our order.Price wise, not cheap, but that's expected seeing that this restaurant is located at the harbor. We got our order, walked over towards the beach to check out the views, then headed back to the car to eat. Sadly, the fries (came with both the fish+chips and the seafood pasta) got all soggy. The complementary salad for the seafood pasta was pretty plain. The pasta was pretty good, but the noodles were kind of sticking to one another because of the cheese. Seafood was good, but overall it was kind of a disappointing meal. Huge portion though (we ended up bringing it back home to finish the remaining ~2/3). The fish and chips were also okay, but definitely not a ""wow.""",3 star rating,Ashley K.
3/22/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was great!!! Food, service, location!!  We got the Garlic Baked Clams (GBC's)!!! Hella bomb!

5/10/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Solid lunch/dinner spot. Waited for 90 minutes on a Saturday which was expected since it was Mother's Day weekend. Staff was incredibly nice and attentive! I got the burger which I ordered medium but received well done. Still good though! The calamari was pretty great and so was the fried shrimp, clam chowder was tasty too!!",4 star rating,Kevin L.
2/6/2021,"Riverside, CA","This place is so popular, so be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations. We came here on a Saturday around 5:30 PM, and we were told the wait would be 1 hour. It's good they give you a pager to tell you when your table is ready so that you can explore the harbor. We only had to wait about 30 mins before our pager rang, so we were pleased that the wait was shorter than expected. Unfortunately due to Covid, indoor dining was not allowed, so we had to sit outside. It was quite chilly (even with the outdoor heaters) so make sure to bring a jacket! I got the seafood pasta, and I was pleased that it came with clam chowder since I was craving clam chowder. The entree also came with a choice of rice or fries (all da carbs!). The entree portion was HUGE and so worth the price (~$22). The seafood pasta was definitely solid. I enjoyed the scallops, shrimp, and the pasta flavor. The portion of seafood was relatively small compared to the pasta, but this was because the pasta was legit ENDLESS. Even though I was constantly stuffing my face, I was barely making a dent in the meal. Overall, I definitely would say the meal is very worth the price for what you get. So stunned to have the entree come with clam chowder AND rice/fries. You will be stuffed after eating here! Service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly, but we did have to wait a bit towards the end for our bill (probably bc they were so busy). Still would say we had a pleasant experience at this restaurant!",4 star rating,Jennifer H.
2/9/2021,"Santa Ana, CA","I have a tendency to order with my stomach and eyes but with that being said, the left overs were just as good as it was fresh! The clam chowder was perfect and creamy. The Rockefeller Oysters & Garlic Baked Clams were seasoned well. The seafood pasta was flavorful and the fish & chips was one of the best I've ever had, crunchy on the outside and flakey inside.",5 star rating,Justine A.
1/31/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Santa Barbara's premier seafood restaurant. When I think of GOOD New England-style clam chowder, I think of Brophy's. This place practically puts the soup on the map for some of the best out there. It's thick, creamy, substantial, and full of flavor - and clams! So fresh and always hits the spot. There is usually always a wait and the front lobby area is small and awkward, but the view once you sit down makes it worth the while. I love their oyster shooters and their fish n' chips entree, but you really won't go wrong with anything on the menu here. I'm also a big fan of the pre-meal bread. It's served warm and is just delicious. Not a tourist trap, but a true locals' spot through and through. I can't wait to come back.",5 star rating,Eric G.
2/1/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","We don't really eat all seafood, but we do consume fish and this was one of the popular choice in Santa Barbara. We visited for a late lunch and parked near the Yacht club. From there, we walked around to try and figure where the restaurant is. We realized that people were dining upstairs, so we followed the group heading up. When we got to the restaurant, there was not a host in sight. Whilst trying to figure out where the desk/hosts were, a guy noticed our ""lost"" group and pointed to where the supposedly entrance was at. Mind you, this restaurant was fairly small, so being ""lost"" just meant  there were no instructions anywhere by the door. Once we headed to the ""right"" entrance, we were fortunate to sit outside with the marina view. The host was very nice and our server was also very nice.We ordered the fish and chips and I instantly loved it. So much so that we ordered it to-go for my sister ( 2 hours from where we lived).",3 star rating,Myrtle P.
8/20/2020,"Menlo Park, CA","Outstanding find in Santa Barbara in the harbor area--a BIG thanks to the valet guy at the Bacara Ritz resort for recommending this place to us. The food was outstanding--very fresh seafood,excellently seasoned and perfectly cooked. The wait was bad on a Monday night....75 mins, but it was worth it. But they have a small roadside cafe type place located downstairs that offers similar foods to what they sell in the main restaurant. The grilled cheese made with 3 kinds of cheese, tomatoes and avocado was one of the best I've ever had. (I ate half of my kids' it was that good...sorry Kekoa...)We sat on the upstairs outdoor balcony that had tons of wind rolling through (good during these Covid-19 times). Service was outstanding too. She checked on us, made recommendations, knew where her fish was caught and how (line caught, etc.) and seemed legitimately interested, that we were all doing well, multiple times during dinner. This is exactly the type of service that sets the bar for all servers. I took her recommendation of the locally caught halibut, which was outstanding. Perfectly cooked--tender and well seasoned. Absolutely you need to come here and really enjoy your Santa Barbara ""staycation!""",5 star rating,Ron M.
9/7/2020,"Irvine, CA","This was the highlight of our trip to Santa Barbara. If you are planning to eat here, arrive before it opens or be prepared to wait over an hour. We had the baked/grilled clams, clam chowder, and fish and chips. Everything was perfect, including the view. I'm happy we waited for a table upstairs because that's where you get a view of the marina. Can't wait to come back here again!",5 star rating,Sabrina G.
1/31/2021,"Irvine, CA","I know this is a tourist hot spot but it delivers. I love order the largest clam chowder so my husband and I don't have to fight over it.Fish and chips were great as well.

4/10/2021,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA","And the search goes on.....Our August '20 Hawaii trip got shut down by that states governor, so we decided to do Santa Barbara instead. Like getting an AMC Pacer for your loaner car while your Bugatti is in the shop! No offense, Santa Barbara!Now, this was back when indoor dining wasn't allowed. So when I was making plans to stay I was searching around for restaurants. Being Santa Barbara, I felt seafood would be apropos. Wasn't easy finding places that specified outdoor seating, and even fewer that took reservations. One place had both, but not open on Mondays! Jagoffs!So, I decided to leave dinner to chance. Well, as chance had it, this place was closest in walking distance from our hotel. Maybe half a mile. When we got there, had to put our name on a list and was told about 45 minutes. Well, I abhor waiting, but we roamed about the harbor to pass the time. We were finally seated our issue, upstairs overlooking the ocean. Nice views. Had the cold combo app, clam chowder, wife went with seafood pasta, daughter had some shrimp, and I went with the swordfish.  Combo was good, chowder very rich, wife's dish looked yummy, as did daughter's shrimp. Swordfish .... not so much. You see, I once had swordfish. Circa 1992, in the little seaside town of Kirkland, WA. An intimate Italian restaurant. And it was so effin' good! And for many years, if I saw swordfish on a menu, I'd order it. But disappointment followed disappointment, until I basically gave up on trying to recapture the magic of that perfect swordfish I once loved and ate. When I saw it on Brophy's menu, I felt those butterflies in my stomach once again, like the first time a girl says you have a cute butt. I mean, they're a seafood restaurant. They freakin' specialize in seafood! I gotta do it!!Magic was not recaptured, and yet again, the search goes on....",4 star rating,Michelangelo B.
9/9/2020,"San Francisco, CA","Sadly this was the only place that left me disappointed. After having Splash Cafe Clam Chowder, Brophy Bros' clam chowder was just meh. It wasn't as tasty and just very clunky. The oysters were pretty decent, but also a bit of sand. The view was nice and service was very friendly. I probably won't come back given the amount of better food in Santa Barbara. The walk along the harbor was super nice though. Also there's 90 min free parking in the lot.",3 star rating,Art C.
4/11/2021,"Walnut Creek, CA","Our 1 night in Santa Barbara and we tried Brophy based on the great reviews. Note to self, anything in a touristy spot will get a ton of reviews and usually is a miss since it's more hype due to the location. This was no exception. Located on the wharf we had about a 45 min wait around 5:45pm on a Saturday. There was indoor & outdoor dining. It's a small place. While I was waiting for our table we watched local fisherman unloading live crabs. So yummy! Unfortunately no crab on the menu here (sigh). Once we were seated hubs got the burger, my daughter and I split the seafood pasta & my son had fish and chips. The seafood pasta was underwhelming. The sauce was liquid, shrimp & scallops. It didn't have much flavor and the sauce was so watery it needed to be thicker like a sauce. Clam chowder was good. My son said the fish was good but the fries were lacking. Overall I'd say 2.5 as the price was not outrageous but the food definitely needed improvement.",2 star rating,Jules K.
10/4/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","A rare eatery that deserves the lofty reputation. Consistently good seafood, nicely-sized portions, friendly staff, and gorgeous views all combine to create a great atmosphere and wonderful experience. The seabass is perfectly cooked and full of flavor, fish and chips are a classic, the appetizers are a meal in themselves, and the chowder is a winner.",5 star rating,Mark Y.
12/30/2020,"San Jose, CA","My family and I only got the clam chowder as we just wanted a little snack so I feel like I can't give any more than 4 stars since I didn't really try much of their other menu items. There was a line waiting to pick up their food, so I'm assuming that it must be good. We ordered online and we didn't wait long to get our clam chowder which is great. I like to think that if you ordered something small like a clam chowder, they should be able to get it to you quickly. With the clam chowder, they gave us some bread too which was really nice if you wanted to dip it in your soup. We really liked the soup, so if we're in town again, I'm sure we'd like to try other stuff on their menu as well!",4 star rating,Kaitlyn C.
3/25/2021,"Oakland, CA","I had a craving for fish and chips. Lots of times, it's a disappointment. Not this time!  It was a three piece serving wit light batter, not greasy or doughy. Really meaty fish with great tartar sauce. Fries were great too. Hubs had clam chowder, I loved it. It was full of potato and tender clams, not chewy and not too garlicky. Fast service. I will definitely come back and get fish and chips and chowder.   Side salad and slaw were so-so, a bit bland for these foodies but Ok.",5 star rating,amy j.
12/21/2020,"Union City, CA","My friend recommended that I come here because he claimed that they had the best fish n chips he has ever had. He was right. The fish is so fresh and so crunchy and went deliciously with the tartar sauce they provided! I also had the fried calamari which were just ok. They were cut in the ring form where as I prefer there to be fried tentacles too. I think it ended up being too much fried food in the end. The best surprise was that the raw oysters were really good! So fresh, and they went down so smooth.",4 star rating,Danny L.
7/4/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","The open air ambience was nice but the food was just ok. Only the fresh oysters and giant fresh clams were the stars here. Other than that, a nice place to enjoy some drinks and view the harbor.Two orders of half a dozen oysters (4/5) they were one of the freshest oysters we had so far in Santa Barbara. Pricey however but goodCioppino (2/5) this was ok. Barely had any seafood to the tomato broth ratio. The tomato flavor tasted like canned tomato. Steamed clams (4/5) light and juicy. The clams are big here. Overall a 3 in my book. Would be back for shucked oysters and steamed clams",3 star rating,Tina V.
3/9/2021,"San Jose, CA","Wow, I must came on a bad night. It was me and my bfs anniversary weekend and wanted something delicious. We came to a conclusion we'd try Brophy's from hearing so much about it. I was so excited for this place but it left me feeling empty. Checked in at 6:40pm for a table and was told it'd be 1 1/2 hour wait. They make you give an id card in exchange for a buzzer. I went next door to grab a quick bite so I wouldn't be starving. By the time I got my food, the table was ready (40 mins later) Scarfing down my sushi as I head up  to my table, I was seated by a lovely young woman. Now time for the fun stuff. The waitress was busy and said I'll be right with you with some waters. 10 mins later. Nothing. I didn't mind because I am always having good conversations while waiting. 15 mins later and our waters are here but before the waitress can leave again, I let her know I am ready to order.Calamari App, fish n ships, seafood pasta comes with rice and soup. Another waitress comes by and notices we that we don't have any bread on our table and quickly brings one out. Oh this is getting good no?!Wrong. The calamari came out, great crunch to it so we're off to a good start. Clam chowder is next and boy it is in my top 3 favs! Too bad there was barely any clams! dun dun dun....... Seafood pasta with rice  and the fish n chips follow. Seafood pasta just looks like they dumped cheese on it, which it was, and if you read other reviews, it'll state that as well. The scallops smelt bad and dark colored. I ate one and left a nasty taste in my mouth. I didn't complain or mention anything, as it was such a busy night and the waitress was already running around too much. The pasta was more sour than a light lemony flavor. Shrimps were the only good thing about the darn plate. It came with about 5-6 shrimps!  Rice was a big fail, too much water. I ate like 4 grains and left it. Fish n chips were oily and fries were not all that. Me and my bf left more than half our plates and quickly paid. We left a nice tip, as the waitress looked like she needed a break. We left and was very unsatisfied. For being a seafood restaurant right next to the darn water, the food should at least be fresh! The menu is not expensive at all, making me feel like the food should excel at what they have?!",3 star rating,Emily L.

Seafood lovers is a must go place for you. We ordered few dishes bcoz I went with my family. Everything was good except tuna sandwich. I am not sure that sandwich was bad or tuna itself. Our server was so kind when I mentioned her about this tuna sandwich which my son absolutely hated she politely removed it from our check and suggested us other dishes.

The batter was so light and airy it was amazing. I will say i was very very disappointed in my waitress. The hostess was so sweet and professional that i even asked to speak to her Manager to tell her what a wonderful job she was doing but said she was busy. Our waitress on the other hand was difficult. Didn't seem like she wanted to help us, give suggestions or refill anything. We had to ask her several times for water and bread and other things. Not sure why she treated us like this.

3/14/2021,"Goleta, CA","Brophys has a special place in all of Santa Barbara's hearts. If someone comes to town, I recommend this place as a great place to have lunch. The view, the people, and the bloody Mary's a perfect way to start your day. It's a great family place. Something for everyone, even if you don't eat fish. My daughter loves the hamburger. My son, gets the spaghetti with butter. There's also a chicken sandwich and really tasty salad you can order. I do miss the full menu they had prior to COVID. It's understandable to downsize the menu as most restaurants have but please bring back the breaded scallops that you dip in their house made tartar! Our family frequents Brophy's at least once a month. If your visiting or want a fun family staycation, take Little Toot (a water taxi) over to the pier and back for fun!

We ordered the poke salad, salmon with clam chowder, and the garlic baked clams. The poke was fresh but the salad dressing honestly wasn't that special. However, the clam chowder and the clams made up for the poke! The clams were large and packed with flavor. The clam chowder had a lot of clams in it too and perfectly seasoned. I would come back but probably won't order the poke and try something else. I'd definitely get the clam chowder and the clams though!",4 star rating,Emily L.

We were seated immediately and in the perfect spot outside facing the harbor. We had calamari to start and then clam chowder with a side salad.

2/24/2021,"San Diego, CA","Food is barely acceptable, and the restaurant was very unorderly. I got the cioppino, the flavor is quite nice but the fish were all in small flakes. There were some dead mussels and clams that did not open up. I ordered ahead of time and payed in advance, but when I came to the restaurant, no one helped me to grab my order. The takeout were all lined up on the bar and it took me a while to find mine. The bartender seemed way to busy to handle the takeout. I grabbed my bag and left, but really, anyone could come in and grab a random bag and no one would notice. Even my local chipotle does better than that.",3 star rating,Sophia S.
12/27/2020,"Redwood City, CA","I've consistently enjoyed their array of seafood offerings over the years, especially the clam chowder with sourdough bread and fish & chips. A harborside location is always a bonus in my opinion. After several straight Brophy seafood meals, I opted for the burger after learning the owners wife doesn't like fish so they also offer an excellent burger and steak options. Have always experienced helpful and friendly bartenders over the years. During the covid situation the hostesses aren't always as attentive or gracious as they should be so I'm deducting a star.",4 star rating,Sonya B.

2/5/2021,"San Gabriel, CA","Stopped by Brophy's for a quick lunch during our little road trip. During covid, outdoor dining was closed so we placed an online order togo and ate on the grass. We decided to order the garlic baked clams, they were delicious and didn't disappoint. It was probably our favorite dish, super garlicky and the clams tasted fresh. We also ordered the fish and chips based off of Yelp reviews we read. They were so good! The batter was light and the fish was flakey, the fries were crispy and delicious as well. I wish they gave more tar tar sauce though. We also ordered the seafood pasta, we didn't know it would come with salad, and fries. I wish we could've subbed it for soup since we already had fries and cole slaw from the fish and chips. The pasta was okay, I was expecting the sauce to be thicker and creamier, but it was more watery. It did come with a good amount of scallop and shrimp though. We barely dented the pasta cause we were so full from the other food, we ate the rest of the pasta for dinner. Overall, the food was good and I would definitely visit again when I'm back in SB.",4 star rating,Wendy T.

10/1/2020,"Tustin, CA","WORTH THE WAIT. OMG BEST RESTAURANTS IN SB!!my first time in SB and saw this was highly rated on yelp and the yelpers were not wrong. santa barbara shellfish company aint got nothing on brophy bros... we walked from our hotel and arrived around 6:20pm on a friday night. we found the wait to be over an hour and they had so many people there that they ran out of buzzers and told me to return twice to receive one, but they never had any. we spent our hour wait walking the walkways near the beach, water and boats. plus, there are plenty of seats outside nearby to wait. alas, 7:30pm we were seated on the upper deck outdoors (since they only served outdoors during covid).THE FOOD:-FREE BREAD... YES THEY HAVE AMAZING FREE SOURDOUGH BREAD THAT MY BODY COULDNT GET ENOUGH OF :D-garlic baked clams ($15.95) - comes with 6 clams and these were VERY rich, but delicious. my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about them. I think since they're so rich it is great to share among a group. but definitely try these out and pour lots of lemon juice on them!!-seafood pasta ($21.95) - OMG... so we didn't realize entree specials came with cole slaw, clam chowder or salad, and fries or rice pilaf... ARE YOU SERIOUS?! this is enough to feed 3 people LOL amazing. totally worth the price. HOWEVER let me detail each item:-seafood pasta - DO NOT ORDER. I dont know why this is a thing, but it was fresh seafood with watery, no flavor linguine. it made me never want to eat linguine again. get something else.-cole slaw - disappointing, but comes with a lot-clam chowder cup - HOLY MOLY. MY FIRST CLAM CHOWDER AND AM BLOWN AWAY. 10x better than santa barbara shellfish company down the street. comes with the oyster crackers and the flavor of the clam chowder is out of this world. PLUS with the free sourdough bread I dunked the crap out of it. MUST GET.-fries - came with so much!!!!!! these were perfectly delicious and just banging. LOL get it!PROS:-SWEETEST server. 9/11/20 served us at 7:30pm on the upper deck. female with dark hair. she was so sweet and nice. even the other gentlemen working the deck were nice when we encountered them. JUST 10 STARS for the staff working the tables.-free bread...-best clam chowder-beautiful view-MADE US FEEL SO DAMN SAFE during covid. omg. I haven't really been dining into restaurants except this trip and they had a hand sanitizer bottle of GOOD hand sanitizer (not the bad smelly ones) sitting on the table and you could tell they were very clean and respective of our space and wearing masks.CONS:-seafood pasta is just a no for me-staff at the front taking names down aren't the nicestOVERALL:im recommending everyone to come here. worth the wait. left a lasting impression on us during our first trip out here. thank you brophy bros!",5 star rating,Jennifer Q.
3/1/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Not worth it. We waited for a table for 1.5 hours, but I didn't mind due to the rave reviews I read on yelp. I thought this place would honor the delicious natural flavor of the local seafood but instead they cover everything with parmesan or deep fry it. We ordered the most recommended dishes: garlic steam clams tasted more like bacon and parmesan. You could not even taste the garlic. The seafood pasta was covered in parmesan and extremely heavy. I couldn't taste the shrimp and scallops in in. All I tasted was oil. Also, you get a side of either french fires or rice with your order of pasta. Why? I have no idea. The seabass was breaded and just okay. The fish and chips were pretty good, but nothing I would go back for. The clam chowder was good, but again I have had better. What was excellent here was our waitress. Very attentive and fast. 5 stars for her! But this review is specifically for the heavy heavy meal. Perhaps I should have gone with the ceviche. Otherwise, I highly suggest taking some alka seltzer with you to prepare for your meal.",2 star rating,Mansta A.

3/17/2020,"Fresno, CA","'Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference.' An unexpected act of extreme kindness was just what we experienced when ate at this restaurant. You see, we had been in town for a local festival that was cancelled abruptly by the recent virus going around. Having limited activity options, we gave up and came to this area in search for some good food. We had intended to eat at another place, On the Alley, but were unable to because of their seating situation. We left 'On the Alley' and had no clue where we would go next. Thats when the girl from On the Alley came running outside and said she would go up to Brophy's and inquire about us eating there. The only problem, in our mind, was access since one member of our group is in a wheelchair and Brophy's is located on the 2nd floor. Initially confused why the girl from On the Alley would go up there, we gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited for her return. In a moment that restored my faith in humanity, she returned w/ the Manager of Brophy's who said that she would be opening their downstairs restaurant JUST FOR US!!! That's right, the WHOLE DOWNSTAIRS that was closed to any and all would be opened just for US!!! As I write this I am still in awe of their generosity. I just cannot express how thankful I am...(I'm not crying, you're crying). As we settled in, the Manager brought us menus and waters along w/ some warm sourdough bread to start. We all decided on the Fish N Chips and a cup of Chowder, when in Rome...I'll get to the food in a minute, but I want to shout out the Manager who not only opened up the place for us but who worked her butt off, not just running up and down to the stairs to put our order in, bringing us our food, refills on drinks and bread, worked in vain to try to turn the music on...but that she did ALL of that and with a genuine smile on her face. It really touched my heart. Hungry passerby-ers tried stopping in, but she ever so gently let them know that the restaurant downstairs was closed, but that they could dine upstairs. I'm sure they were confused, wondering why were allowed to dine there, but she didn't make it an issue. Our food arrived not long after ordering and wow...it was good. My opinion is unrelated to above and beyond service we received. Sure it helps, but had we not been in the situation I know I would've loved it just the same. The fish had a VERY light batter, fried to perfection and the fish was flaky w/ NO fishy taste...fresh. It was served w/ poppyseed coleslaw and fries. It comes 3pc to an order but that was just enough. I was able to take 2pcs back to my Hotel that night to enjoy for dinner and had the sauces to dip it in since she went and got us lids for all of the condiments. We were just a couple of humans in need, GOD presented an opportunity, and the Managers kindness made ALL of the difference.",5 star rating,VeeVee N.
9/17/2020,"Long Beach, CA","Stopped in for lunch last week. It looked pretty active . The hostess told us it would be a 30 min wait and she needed my ID. Ok, that's fine. What to do for 30 min?Well luckily for my girl and I there was a liquor store and it sold alcohol. So we grab a tall can and walk along the wharf. 5 min later and two drinks in our buzzer goes off. I guess at this point I should be happy but I want to finish my beer. We get there and we are seated in the  patio that's adjacent to the main restaurant. It was a warm day but I'm assuming the weather changes and can get breezy/cold as they had the heaters on - so be weary it can get warm if you're wearing a sweater or extra layers of clothing. Our server I believe her name was Kat - that's what it said on the receipt. Hope that's her name ( we were there for lunch 9/10 around 3-3:30)She was wearing a mask but the way she spoke to us and her cheery attitude made me feel like she was smiling every time she came to check on us.  We ended up ordering a cup of Clam Chowder, the Cioppino, and a side order of fries to share because who doesn't love fries. The chowder was good. Meaty and creamy and wasn't clumpy. I wasn't really in the mood for chowder but I'm glad I was able to taste it. My girl enjoyed it and it would definitely be a nice welcome on a cold day. The Cioppino was really tasty. The tomato broth was very good - when we weren't jamming on the delicious pieces of fish, mussels, and clams, my girl and I were fighting over the bread to soak up the delicious broth. Overall it was a nice day date. Bloody Mary's, seafood, and a nice view. We will definitely be back when visiting SB again.",4 star rating,joe R.

The seafood pasta, scallops and shrimp, comes with soup (clam chowder or salad) I ordered the clam chowder, I'll say I've had different not better. It's more thicker, starchy but it's really good. Compared to some make thinner with a creamier/taste of sherry and more clam and less potato.Absolutely loved the crab & shrimp salad the dressing let's the seafood shine and the greens are perfectly sized and tastes like farm to table.I love this place and they have the freshest seafood!!!!Looking forward to when they are fully open to enjoy the upstairs bar while waiting for a table, and they have done a fantastic job with dealing with the shutdown!!!!This place has always been a Hit!!!

There is the option of sitting upstairs, on the patio or right in front however we chose the patio due to less people walking by us. I I got the seafood pasta with white wine, the pasta had both shrimp and scallops. The shrimp was great, but the scallops were pretty undercooked. The entire meal was hearty, as I was only able to eat about half of it before getting full. The special also came with a small clam chowder which was great, as well as a side of either rice pilaf or fries, neither of which seemed to pair well with the pasta.

2/27/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","ORDER EVERYTHING but make sure you can eat it all! We ordered mostly appetizers for two people. We were lucky to be seated outside where we could see the docks and the sunset.We started with the ceviche. It's mostly fish for the seafood I believe. I don't remember any shrimp or any other kinds of seafood inside. Lots of lemon taste and well seasoned. Has a slight kick but not spicy. I loved their chips. Very thin and crispy. Reminded me of Chipotle chips minus chipotles lime salt. Then we got a oyster shooters without alcohol. This has very spicy hot sauce inside so beware!! It was also topped with cheese, it was actually nice. I didn't expect it to taste well with a fresh oyster but it worked. We of course got half a dozen of the oysters and the little neck clams. So fresh. So good. Order extra because I loved the clams. Oh yes. We would describe it as ""ocean-y"" in a good way though. Add lemon and it was good just as is. Add some sauce and horseradish and wooooo it was a party in my mouth!! We wanted to try everything so we got the clam chowder cup as well. My tip is to eat this all for yourself because it was THAT GOOD. It has a lot of potato in it. I'm not a potato fan. Usually I take the chunks out when I drink soup but these potatoes were a bit disintegrated so it was part of the soup whether I wanted it to be or not. However this worked in its favor. There was a LOT of clams in this chowder. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm telling you again, don't share. Get your own cup or even bowl!! Lastly we got the calamari appetizer, good to share for more than two people. This came last so it was a bit tough to finish. It was just okay in my opinion.. stick with their fresher seafood. You can thank me later PS they serve really nice bread!!! If you get soup, save a slice or two to dunk in!!! I would come back to Santa Barbara just for this meal.

1/4/2020,"San Ramon, CA","After a Holiday traffic nightmare on the road, we decided to just get off the 101 rest and wait out the craziness. Brophy Bros. is a Santa Barbara landmark and usually stop in when we are in the area. They open at 11 am and is constantly packed with locals and tourists. The main dinning room / bar is not large and they do have outside seating on the terrace with a bar downstairs too. Brophy Bros. is a seafood raw bar restaurant and IMO has the best clam chowder in Santa Barbara. Its chunky with tons of chopped clams. On our recent visit we ordered the following:Seafood combo comes with ceviche, shrimp, oysters and clamsLittle Neck clams on the half shellFried CalamariA big bowl of the clam chowder.The raw clams and oysters were very fresh and the hot fried calamari was excellent.

7/6/2020,"San Rafael, CA","It was a beautiful day in Santa Barbara and we knew we wanted to eat somewhere with delicious seafood and a great view. Brophy Bros had just what we wanted. Their seafood is pretty popular and their restaurant is near the harbor. From most tables, you can get an amazing view of the water. We ordered a bunch of their specials. The blackened cod was very flavorful. Adding the drawn butter that they provided with the cod made the flavors stand out even more. The swordfish was very tender with some light grill marks to provide that delicious smokiness. It came with guacamole and salsa, which added a refreshing element to the dish.  If you want to try a little of everything, the hot combo is a great way to do so. This seafood combo has steamed shrimp, mussels, and clams, as well as baked clams with breadcrumbs and ooey gooey oysters Rockefeller. The seafood pasta also has a good variation of seafood with scallops and shrimp. These paired with a light white wine and lemon sauce over pasta is excellent. ​There is nothing better than eating magnificent seafood with a breathtaking view.

Half dozen oysters of the day which were from East coast. They were big and super fresh. I love the cocktail sauce served. 2. Clam chowder was nice and thick and filled with clams. Not salty and could have probably done the bowl versus the cup! 3. Ahi Poke tuna salad was refreshing with a ton of tuna chunks and won ton strips. It was a generous proportion in which we split and still could not finish. 4. Shrimp scampi came with about 6 jumbo shrimps, cole slaw, and fries. Super fresh with a nice clean taste. Didn't feel heavy at all. Atmosphere/Service: Great service. Servers often check in to ensure everything is good. We loved the outdoor dining upstairs that had a great view of the water and boats.

10/12/2019,"Simi Valley, CA","As I told our nephew when the three of us went to Brophy Brothers last weekend, and he asked me how I found the place - ""I've been coming here since the 80's"".  As an old timer (as a patron of Brophy's), I was really pleased when they opened in Ventura, yet it's always satisfying to go back to the original location.I would gladly bestow five stars on this old favorite, except for two things on our visit.  One, we weren't served their delicious sourdough bread.  Yikes!  That's one of my main reasons for dining by the shore.  Sourdough and the salty tang of harbor air just go together so well.Our server, while very good, was about to go off shift, and perhaps a bit distracted. Also, maybe the busboy is supposed to handle the bread delivery?  Anyway, it was missed - mostly upon reflection later.The second factor for a lower score is that we were seated inside, instead of being able to enjoy a view.  It would have been a substantial wait for a table for 3, as the balcony is mostly 2-tops, and we were starving.  Missing out on the stellar view does take the experience down a notch.Still, the boisterous atmosphere, with its mix of guests from many different walks of life, is full of energy.  Oyster shucking takes place at the central bar, for a super-fresh taste treat.  The friendly staff keeps it moving.  They turn tables at a brisk clip here.I'd call it a must-do in Santa Barbara for a waterfront venue that's away from the touristy Stearn's Wharf.  Ultra fresh seafood with simply effective preparation will be your reward.",4 star rating,Lianne K.

10/8/2019,"West Hollywood, CA","We weren't sure what to expect in Santa Barbera. The main drag, State Street, was kind of generic in an upscale way ... you could have been in Corona, Naples, FL or Carmel. There wan't much distinguishing it and the restaurants and bars were all similar and brand new feeling.Way off the main drag near the Marina (about 20-30 minute walk) is Brophy Brothers. Its a seafood spot locals and tourists alike visit. The views are spectacular of the marina and distant mountains.We found the prices unbelievably cheap but the portions were smaller than many places. Thankfully, we weren't incredibly hungry and it was just enough to satisfy. The clam chowder was perfect (and this coming from a native New Englander) and the Cioppino was great. Not the best Cioppino I've had by a longshot but better than I expected given the location of the restaurant in a touristy area.The fresh baked sourdough bread was fantastic and a welcome addition to dip in the broth.The biggest downfall is that there is no draft beer. It only comes in cans for $7 each. As surprised about the low(ish) food prices as we were, they make up for it by charging $7 per can.If you are looking for no frills above average seafood at nice prices, Brophy's delivers. Get the chowder or Cioppino. Skip the scallops. Thet were small, tasteless and breaded way too thick amd served with unmemorable fries.",4 star rating,Adam B.

2/9/2021,"La Sierra Hills, Riverside, CA","Service kinda sucked. I placed a mobile order for literally 1 small bowl of clam chowder. I got there at the time given to me when I placed the order. As soon as I walked up to the podium outside I saw a bag on the counter inside .. so a server smiled at meBut did not greet me or ask if I needed help. She went upstairs  and did this a few more times never acknowledging me . Also the bartender kept glancing but did not ask what I needed either. I thought it was weird but just waited for help and also I understood with covid they may have had certain specifications but I stood there for another 15 minutes not being helped or even acknowledged. Then an older lady walked in and spoke to the bartender who I now see is the owner according to this Yelp page which is crazy and they spoke for a good couple of minutes and hung out then turned to me and said ""now we can help the next guest"" . Lol.. like they stood there for over 20 minutes doing nothing and couldn't even speak up to ask what I needed and sure enough when I walked up and let them know I had already placed a mobile order and my name she grabbed the single bag that had been sitting on the counter the entire time I stood outside. Just sh*t service and weird from the moment I walked up. Also two men had tried to walk in to place an order about ten minutes into me standing there and they told them to wait in line behind me . So still pretty unsure for the reasoning they had us waiting outside all that time while they were chillen . 3 stars for the simple fact that the chowder was good but wouldve been better had I gotten it right away when it was hot and packaged. I was here on business for the day so I had no way to heat it up so yeah ... definitely a locals only or f*ck off kinda vibe in my opinion!",3 star rating,Lauren P.

That said, it's crowded because the food is good, the staff is great, and it's got a cool vibe, perched as it is on the second floor of a building overlooking the harbor. Not sure how it has adjusted to Covid, but in pre-dystopian times they offered delicious chowder and beach pub food favorites. It's beloved by the locals who frequent it and the lucky tourists who stumble across it. If you've got the time, check it out.",5 star rating,Dare H.

10/31/2019,"Mentor, OH","Fresh seafood on the wharf. Very casual environment with very closely packed tables. Went in with the intention of having a cocktail with lunch and I didn't feel it was worth ordering a drink as I was not going to relax in the environment. The service was more diner style. We started with a mixed seafood app that was delicious! The oysters were wonderful, tender and tasty, as were the peel and eat shrimp. It was a little bit messy and came in a bowl of broth that we really would've appreciated some bread to sop up. Nobody really came back around to ask them for that though. We then tried the fish and chips and the blackened sea bass. The sea bass was delicious but very pricey for the size of the cut. It was a very thin tail end. It was wonderful and I have no idea why they served it with a cup of drawn butter as it didn't need it whatsoever and over powered the light fish. The batter on the fried fish was light in texture and flavor making the perfect coating just to adhere the tarter sauce to. The chips (fries) were blah. Obviously they are focusing on their fresh seafood and they are doing a fantastic job at that!",3 star rating,Kristen M.
9/5/2020,"Irvine, CA","So per Yelp Brophy is one of the top seafood restaurants in Santa Barbara so we had to come.  Wait was long, the venue was small, old, and dirty.  Ordered the sea bass which was highly recommended to me by restaurant, but it was blackened with overpowering spices.  Fresh fish should not be cooked like that.  And their bathroom was disgusting.",2 star rating,Catherine Y.

I  had a quick detour home from a weekend Solvang trip and my bf found this spot via yelp recommendations. I am so delighted to have stopped by here because their food is so bomb. I mean, seriously. I couldn't help but say that their entrees were delicious. We ordered the shrimp scampi, a bowl of new England clam chowder, and an order of fish and chips. To be honest, I absolutely loved their beer battered fish and chips! I cannot emphasize how light, flavorful, and tasty their fried fish batter was, not to mention, the fries were so crispy and fresh. We definitely had a big feast for 2 but I was definitely not complaining! For a Monday lunch rush, we waited about 45 minutes and I was able to take my little rsvp buzzer for a walk on the pathway by the beach. It wasn't too bad of a wait, and they did offer us a table inside (limited indoor seating due to Covid-19), but it was a really good experience. Our server (didn't quite get her name, sadly) was excellent and she made sure we were enjoying our meal. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a good meal and view!

Some of the best clam chowder I've ever had, and the view really can't be beat!Be careful - there's like a ""Brophy Bros Lite"" version downstairs - a bar and high tops with a limited menu. The real restaurant is upstairs with a more extensive menu and better seating.We wanted a table outside, and only ended up waiting 10 minutes. In the meantime, we were able to stand outside and enjoy the view and grab a couple beers standing at the bar window. It was a way better wait than what we expected. We ordered the hot combo, the clam chowder, and the shrimp cocktail. I would recommend all of them, and I don't usually even like seafood or shellfish!

8/19/2019,"Rosemead, CA","In the mood for some fresh and tasty seafood? You have come to the right place. I came for lunch on a weekday and there was a 45 minute wait. That's long but it must be good here, I thought. We started off with the Cold Combo which had shrimp; ceviche; a couple of oysters, clams, and crab meat. Really good and really fresh. Next came the garlic baked clams. Tasty, but the clams were a little small in my opinion. Seafood pasta... winner winner seafood dinner. Really good with lots of seafood and a delicious sauce. Fish & Chips.... pretty good. Large fish portions and plenty of fries and cole slaw. My only suggestion to Brophy Bros is I wish you had larger tables. Our table for 4 was a little small for us so we had to eat rather quickly in order to free up some real estate on our table for the next dish to arrive. Aside from that, food was great and service was spot on too.",5 star rating,Gabriel A.

I drove back to my hotel only to find a huge disappointment. I ordered the crab and shrimp salad. My salad had ZERO crab and maybe 6 shrimp along with egg ( which i don't like and was also not stated in the ingredients online) and bunch of other salad ingredients. I called the restaurant to see if I could get another salad made correctly but they didn't pick up.

It was cooked perfectly!  Slightly crispy, perfectly seasoned outside and moist inside.  I really liked the coleslaw side.  I probably should have gone with the fries, as I didn't care much for the rice pilaf, but that was my fault since I was attempting to be a bit healthier.  Casual atmosphere.  No reservations.  No wait at 9pm on a Thursday.  I think going after peak dining hours is key here.  Tessa, our amazing server, gave us awesome recommendations, friendly service, and got us in and out in an hour flat!  She's the bomb!",5 star rating,Sandee L.

12/31/2020,"Stanton, CA","This review starts with the blonde haired lady giving out orders and calling out names, going up to people to ask them their name, everyone except me. She literally looked at me and then went on to the next person and then she even left to go get change without saying a word to me. I was also the only Asian person there, hmm questionable. So i went inside and told the only guy inside I'm picking up my order for Christine. There was a customer there who said oh there's a bag with the name Christine here. But the worker man proceeded to ask me if it was through Grubhub, i told him i ordered it though Yelp. Then he said nope i don't see your name here and theres only Grubhub bag (the one with my name) so it's not ready yet. So i go back to look at my order through Yelp and it's telling me it's ready for pick up and at this time that lady is back, still wasn't trying to help me. So the customer ended up saying dude, i think that's your order. Frustrated, i went back inside, looked at that bag and low and behold it was mine. The worker should have asked me what i ordered and made sure it was mine before dismissing me. Who knows how much longer i would have had to wait. Thank you to the customer who was trying to help me out, unlike the workers. As far as the food, i ordered fish and chips and fried shrimp. The fish and chips were decent but not better than Gordon Ramsey's in Vegas. The fried shrimp was not good. Most of the pieces were soggy probably due to the fact that it was just sitting there. I do appreciate the sides it comes with, coleslaw and fries as well as tarter, cocktail and ketchup. Overall, i wouldn't be back due to poor service and mediocre food.",3 star rating,Christine N.

11/29/2020,"Sacramento, CA","Very expensive and very underwhelming. But this one star comes from a pretty bad experience I had here, and I try to be fair. First off let me say the clam chowder and the calamari was delicious, but that's a minor part of the meal, after getting that I was excited to get my entree but when it came it only brought disappointment. I got the swordfish with pilaf and it comes with coleslaw. The pilaf was barely warm and lacked any flavor - super bland, the coleslaw lacked flavor as well. Now this is where it gets bad, my swordfish was completely raw in the middle. When I brought it to the waiters attention he had me literally put it on a little plate. Now I've already taken a few bites off of it (it wasn't until a took a bite or two that I saw that it was raw in the next cut) - and the fork that was in my mouth had now been in the fish multiple times. He takes the swordfish back and brings it out fully cooked. I don't think that's very smart considering covid, now everyone who ate something grilled after that had shared what was in my mouth - just bad form. I was expecting a new fish. I honestly couldn't believe that they just cooked my already cut fish longer, first off recooking something that has already been cooked just loses its quality, second of all it's just not sanitary at all. They should have brought me a new fish. I was even half expecting them to cover the meal as that's what a restaurant should do when they mess up an expensive meal like that. Besides that, the fish really had no flavor - how about a sauce or something to go with it? It just wasn't flavorful at all, and it was raw then recooked - all for almost 30 bucks... I will stick to Lure Fishhouse - I'm never coming back here again.",1 star rating,Cameron F.

4/29/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I come to Santa Barbara for work a few times a year, and whenever I am in town I try to eat as much seafood as humanely possible before I venture back inland. Brophy Bros has been on my list for a while, so I'm happy I finally got to check it out!First of all, they have secured their place as my favorite clam chowder in town. As a former New Englander, my standards are high, and most of California simply has not gotten it right (no wonder tabasco is a common topping, most are utterly flavorless!). But Brophy Bros delivered! The clam chowder was perfectly flavorful and balanced, the seafood blending perfectly with the creamy chowder. Love it.The oysters were everything oysters should be--fresh, a bit fishy, but go down smooth, only needing a tiny squeeze of lemon and a touch of horseradish. The uni shooter was also my favorite in town. Don't just shoot it down whole, be sure to bite at least once to get some of that amazing flavor! The only place that I felt Brophy fell short was the fish. I got the blackened seabass and without the drawn butter it would have been a bit bland. Strange, since it looked to be heavily seasoned with cajun spices. The accompanying cole slaw and fries were fine, but for the price this was a bit of a disappointing dish.I'd probably do 3.5 stars if I could, but they win for the appetizers, ambiance, and service for sure, so I don't mind rounding up. I'll be back next time!",4 star rating,Ashley B.
5/28/2019,"Burbank, CA","A second story restaurant in a nice fun harbor. This busy seafood restaurant has waits of about 45 min to 1 hr, so if you are looking for a quick bite turn next door to ""On the Alley"" they share a prep kitchen and owner. I went next door for a quick bite just to keep the hunger at bay while I waited. Brophy Bros may be a little more expensive, it has a one large room and one large bar, it's small so it can get a little crowded. They have a 8- 10 beer selection, I ordered a fairly decent Michelelada, however my girlfriend had a watered down Bloody Mary. We had delicious oysters to start (order of 6, but fairly priced). We then split a pretty fresh shrimp and crab salad ($15). Overall the food is good and fresh, the drinks could be better, but they make up for it with a view.",4 star rating,Alfredo S.

They were very generous with their serving of big, fresh shrimps and crabs that paired nicely with the greens and thousand island dressing. Although, I would advise asking for the dressing on the side; my salad was drowsed in dressing. I also shared the Garlic Baked Clams with my friends. Nothing can go wrong with butter and garlic on fresh clams.",4 star rating,Ploy N.
6/4/2019,"Burbank, CA","When you're in the harbor and looking for a good seafood restaurant, this is the spot. It's quite popular so the main downside about this place is the long wait. We put our names in and it was about an hour wait. They give you a buzzer so you can venture a little bit or grab a drink somewhere. On the lower level, there are other more casual dining spots so you could even grab a little bite while you wait. The restaurant itself is located up a flight of stairs on a second floor. They pack the space with tables and seating so it can get a little loud and crowded. The tables outside look out to the harbor, all the ships, and the water. It's a gorgeous view. We ordered 6 oysters and the shrimp & crab salad. The prices aren't cheap but they don't break the bank either. The salad was really delicious, it's a big portion so you can share it with someone else. The ingredients tasted fresh. I enjoyed it and would order it again. Recommend this place if you're looking for a nicer seafood restaurant with a beautiful view, and you're OK with waiting a bit for a table.",4 star rating,Beatrice V.

11/30/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","They have here raw clams - a sure rarity in the world, sadly enough! The gumbo unfortunately was an experience that did not match - too watery, not flavorful enough. Not sure how many stars the seafood platter (cold combo) deserves, but overall I felt ""A-OK"" about this place. It's an older style restaurant whose saving grace really is the raw clams, and the look and feel go to match - laminated menus, wooden flooring and tables, the whole nautical-ship thing going on. It's a bit resort- cafeteria feeling, and yes, I'll go ahead and say it again - the raw clams are awesome, but the rest had me feeling underwhelmed.",3 star rating,Christopher P.

1/28/2019,"Goleta, CA","Brophy Brother's is a well-known seafood staple for Santa Barbara locals. After moving here, I had a handful of people say, ""Have you been to Brophy's yet?"" Now living here for some time and exploring other eateries in the area, I have some things to say. You come to Brophy's for two things, and only two things:1) The views: It's the quintessential postcard photo of Santa Barbara with boats in the marina, Stearn's wharf pointing at the Channel Islands and the Santa Ynez mountains in the foreground.2) Fish & Chips: They're pretty darn stellar. Beer-battered, fried well without being greasy, and reasonably priced. The fish is better than the chips which are fairly basic but still hit the spot.Instead of waiting in line at Brophy Brother's looking for ______...go to... _____ instead:-Strong drinks...go to...Harry's Plaza Cafe, Joe's Cafe or Longboard's Grill-Chowder or Lobster Bisque...go to...Enterprise Fish Company-Oysters...go to...Lure Fish House or Broadstreet Oyster Company-Flavorful/Spicy Seafood...go to...The Palace Grill-Seafood Brunch (Brophy's opens at 11 AM daily)...go to...Hendry's Boathouse-Same Fish & Chips without the wait?...go to...Brophy's On The Alley in Goleta.Whether you decide to take my advice or not, the bar is always quicker (and steals the best views) and there's 90 minute free parking right after turning in off of Shoreline Drive and before entering the pay lots.",4 star rating,Richie D.

10/12/2020,"San Diego, CA","My boyfriend and I came here for a weekend getaway and looking for some good seafood. It was a little later in the evening so we were happy this place was open. It was right on the water near all the docked boats so it was really cool. The place is cute and I liked the look and feel of it -very old school nautical. We were able to order drinks inside at the bar while we waited for our table. We understand they were busy but we waited like 5 mins inside before anyone even said hi to us and we kinda felt invisible. Once the bartender realized we were there, we were able to order our drinks. The drinks were decent, beware of the ghost chili vodka drink - very spicy! We sat down and loved the view from the second floor. Our waitress was nice but was always in a rush and didn't really take the time to chat or see where we were from. We wish there was more warmth in the staff and they weren't so robotic. Now forewarning, my boyfriend and I are seafood aficionado's and we frequently eat seafood in countless places in SoCal and Vegas too. We had the peel shrimp and oysters for starters and they were sub-par. The shrimp were small and fun to eat but nothing spectacular. The oysters were very disappointing. They were not flavorful at all and pretty mediocre. Again, we have a very spoiled and sophisticated palette which is why it was disappointing for us. What turned our meal around was the clam chowder which was very good and the seafood pasta. Again, the pasta was nothing to do backflips over but it hit the spot. We came to the conclusion this is a very touristy spot and they are constantly trying to get people through the door and maybe wasn't the right place to come for some bomb seafood. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience but we will probably try another spot in the future.",3 star rating,Deanna N.

We sat upstairs on the deck, the tables are a little cramped but everyone wants the best view. But anywhere here has a great view over looking the harbor. We had the clam chowder, it was on the thicker side and was absolutely delicious. I ordered clam strips with grilled veggies, it also came with slaw. The clam strips were cooked to perfection and the grilled veggie skewer was amazing. The slaw was a little warm so it was off putting. We also had a blackened fish sandwich, it was seasoned perfectly and the french fries were also amazing! Can't wait to come back and soak in the California sun!",4 star rating,Remee A.
1/2/2019,"Torrance, CA","The actual restaurant is located upstairs! They have a bar downstairs if you don't really want to wait or just want a small plate. ParkingIf you're lucky, you may be able to grab a free 90 min parking spot (right before the paid parking area) but there's less than 20 spots available. Paid parking is $2/hr. It is nice to have a view and sit outside, but your food may get cold quickly. Also the seagulls fly really close to you if you leave food unattended. -Clam chowder bowl- Probably can pass on this the next time you're here. I had high hopes for the clam chowder, but it was okay. It was also lukewarm when it came out and got cold in about 5 minutes. -Calamari plate- Pretty good, can't go wrong with this plate-Garlic baked clams- surprisingly pretty good too!",4 star rating,Tiffany K.

3/10/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Was told to come down to Brophy Bros for Oysters, and was pretty disappointed with my experience overall, and If you look at my other reviews, it takes a lot for me to give harsh ratings.Anyway, I come down to check it out, and the bar downstairs is packed. But there's an open table by the door, and no host, so I sit down and check the menu myself.I made eye contact and waved to the server multiple times, with menu in hand, showing I was ready to order. The dude walked past so many times it's like he didn't want to take my order. Walked past at least 6 times. Like come on man.So, he's cleaning a table across from where I'm sitting and then while doing that he asked what I wanted.  And I wasn't sure he wanted me to shout across the restaurant to him, but I did. Told him Oysters and Clam Chowder. It was interesting, when I said Oysters his demeanor changed like sort of giving a shit about service. But still, guy was amateur hour.No napkins, Silverware, or even Water refill, after I asked him multiple times for a refill. And also when I asked for Horseradish, the dude forget like three times.  So yeah, he sucked.The food though was alright. Oysters were prepared in away I haven't had before. Like spinach and cheese on top of it. Very good. Just remember like 6 of those for 15 bucks.  Almost worth it, but your call.Also got a cup of Clam Chowda, that was a winner, definetly should grab one of those if you're in the building.Bottom line the service is absolute garbage, the food is just alright, and was not a pleasant experience.  And remember, if you wanna blow more money on Brophies, they got a merchandise store next door so you can remember how terrible the service was, and just alright the food was.

2/12/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","This is for a Saturday night review!What I ordered: Ahi with rice pilaf and slawWhat Bae ordered: Seafood PastaFood: Our meal comes with a slaw and a bowl of clam chowder or tossed salad. Of course we both opted for the chowderIt's good but its forgettable. Nothing on the dish that would WOW you. I was embarrassed that I couldn't finish the second half of ahi because it did show that I didn't really enjoy my mealAs for the pasta, the lemon garlicky taste was good. I think they could've cut the scallops a little smaller. The seafood taste of it kind of overpowers the shrimp and the sauce.Clam chowder was delicious. I like that it doesn't have that strong seafood taste and that it was perfectly balanced with the broth. Potatoes were not mushy and celery tasted fresh. But I would say its not as good as Seattle or the Bay Area one. Price:  $$ It's pretty cheap for a seafood restaurantParking: It's a touristy area. Don't expect anything easy or free with regards to parking. For this one, its 90min free parking around the vicinityService: Our server was very attentive and got all our orders correct. We didn't have to wait for a table!Atmosphere: You will have a good view of the yachts and boats as it was just next to the pier. It can get chilly so don't forget to bring a jacket or sweater, ladies!Verdict: I'd probably not go back if I want seafood in Santa Barbara but I'd be cool having another bowl of clam chowder after a midday stroll!",3 star rating,Margaux S.

We are kind of fish and chips snobs so the expectations going in were high. Verdict: Disappointing. Soggy flavorless batter and fish was flat. Fries were meh, cold and blah. Same goes for the side of Cole slaw. Not much flavor there. Hubby had huge bowl of clam chowder which was so so too.

The reason I don't give them 5 stars is because they give you a buzzer, which the staff ""wipes"" before handing it over to you. However, I noticed that she used the exact same wipe for all the buzzers without spraying any fresh disinfectant onto it. They also ask for an ID to give you the buzzer. Who really wants to hand over her/his ID to somebody else during COVID times?!!! This could all have been avoided if they simply asked for you phone number and texted you when your table was ready.

8/16/2018,"West Covina, CA","Highly overrated seafood restaurant in Santa Barbara. My parents and I took a day trip to SB and, obviously, made plans to have seafood. I know SB is somewhat known for their delicious fish and chips, but for the non-fried route, we wanted to up the ante and splurge on a well-known spot. We were quoted 1 hour wait for our party of 3 but 30 minutes of waiting later, we were seated outside (by request) so we could enjoy the view of the marina. Partial sun (which was fine by my left shoulder is burned lol) but the breeze was amazing coming through the harbor. We waited a good 15 minutes until anyone decided to even take our drink order. I had waited that long to flag someone down to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was busy. However, plenty of servers were helping tables right next to us, but somehow, we were invisible. Very interesting. My family and I tend to stick out like a sore thumb in predominantly non-POC communities like SB. After a while, my parents started to get concerned, so I did what I do best and flagged someone down. Hey, thanks, water please! My mom got their mai tai. Slightly annoyed at this point. But service was good after that.We all have somewhat small appetites (read: my dad has a small appetite, my mom and I do not) so we ordered 2 dishes and an appetizer to share. Mom went with the blackened seabass with a cup of New England Chowder, ya girl went with the hot combo appetizer as my entree. For our appetizer, we shared the oysters Rockefeller since it seems to be iconic American seafood. It's also in the hot combo so we ordered a lot of them unintentionally. My mom liked her seabass just fine, great texture and tasted fresh! But rice pilaf was undercooked so it was hard and rubbery. For the hot combo, the clams, steamed and baked, were overcooked. They were rubbery and bland - difficult to chew so I ended up not eating quite a few. The mussels were just fine but... bland. The shrimps were also flavorless and it kind of sucked that the shells were left on. Cocktail sauce was served on the side which was pretty good, but for shrimps that size, they're usually already shelled ready for a dip. I didn't want to get my hands dirty so I ate them whole. Sigh not a great mouth experience! I'm paying good money for good seafood. Please don't make me work.I was let down after reading so many great reviews here! On our way out, I saw a man had ordered a whole order of the steamed clams. Poor man... you ain't ready for that sore jaw! I don't recommend this spot unless you enjoy overcooked flavorless seafood.

Our orders came through fairly quickly and both the dishes were delicious! I have had clam chowder from many places and they are usually filled with fillers rather than clams, but at Brophy Bros you actually get clams in your chowder! The crab cakes also were made up of primarily crab. Again, most places usually use fillers such as veggies or a lot of breading. You could taste the seafood and how fresh it was in each bite!The service was wonderful and very attentive. It is a very family friendly place to eat some great seafood right on the docks!

You don't have to sit at a stool, there are indoor and outdoor tables usually a short wait but u can have  a glass of wine or cocktail at the standing  outdoor bar. It does get busy and you may wait a bit, but it's worth the wait. It's hands down the best place to enjoy the boats, water, with picturesque views. It's great to  hang with the local people too. Love the girls now running Brophy's , friendly, thoughtful and they work hard , should be Brophy  Sisters now!  It's hard to brag about my favorite place,  as I don't want it to get too busy.  One other point that I love about Brophy's it is a great place for anyone to go alone, grab a stool and feel totally  welcome.  The staff are so friendly and there is always a local to ask questions about Santa B,  if you are visiting.

8/18/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","I was really struggling with the number of stars to give, but the food was just too good to not give more than 3 stars so I'll start with that. My boyfriend and I had started off dinner with the calamari and ceviche appetizers. Oh my goodness. Some of the best seafood I've had in a long time. Everything was fresh and I was surprised at how good the calamari was as it wasn't so chewy as I've had it at other places. I ordered a drink called the dark and stormy. It was good. I wouldn't say cocktails are their specialty here, but at least they've got a bar. Those two appetizers were so much food but we decided to order entrees anyway. I ordered the seafood pasta which had shrimp and scallops. There was so much flavor that I couldn't help but eat more even though I knew I was already stuffed with a few bites. I took the rest home and it was still delicious warmed up a day later. My entree also came with a cup of clam chowder and it was pretty good. I didn't notice the ratio of potatoes and clam, only the amount of flavor. My boyfriend wasn't too crazy about his salmon entree as he felt it lacked flavor and was bland. The part where I wanted to give 3 stars was due to the crowds right next to people trying to dine at the tables outside on the second floor. You could literally have patrons' butts in your face while you're dining. People kept brushing up against us as you're allowed to stand outside the bar window and hang out. It really took a damper on our experience as someone even dropped a glass right by our table that sent broken glass flying near our feet.

Sat dockside at the clam bar and got the fish and chips and peel and eat shrimp - good service, quick delivery - hot and fresh and very tasty!! A bit cheaper than the other spots around the harbor, too - we got to sit and watch the fishing boats come in and clean out their catches - and other boats, too- paddle boat groups and kayakers - nice atmosphere - really enjoyed the meal and the ambiance. Highly recommend if you are out this way.",5 star rating,Liane R.

2/18/2020,"San Diego, CA","Reached SB after a long CA1 drive from SJ, only to find our accommodation cancelled for no good reason and rest of the town completely booked. While we were trying to find a roof to sleep under, we were delayed for our dinner at Brophy's. These guys not only graciously let us order 10 minutes before closing, but the kind staff also gave wrote down some recommendations for us for alternate booking. We order the seafood pasta, tuna melt sandwich, and some chowders and everything exceeded our expectations. Google maps ended location abruptly, so we had parked a bit far and walked to the unassuming place. No one rushed us even though we were the last guests and the ambience was perfect for a seafood lover. Ultimately, we had to drive all the way to Los Angeles for our stay that night, but the warm service here  will remain our most cherished memory of Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Sid W.

We had a short wait for our table which gave us a chance to take a scenic walk along the harbour boardwalk. Before we knew it, our table was ready and we were warmly welcomed by the excellent staff here. I have to say the service was way above par! I had the ahi tuna salad that was such a refreshing summer dish perfect for what I was craving that night. The combination of enjoying the food with my family in this relaxed atmosphere while watching the sun set over the harbour made a truly unforgettable night.",5 star rating,Linda M.

The sea bass was fresh, flaky, and was bursting with flavors!  The swordfish was fresh and full of flavors as well!  We ordered fries as a side and it was yummy too!Location:Our hotel was a 10-minute walk to the harbor, so we just walked instead of being concerned with parking.  The harbor is small and peaceful.",5 star rating,Claire G.

8/17/2018,"Pasadena, CA","Heard that Brophy Bros was a classic SB spot but that it would get packed quickly, so we head over 15 mins before they opened to stand in line and were able to be seated in the first wave. This is one of those casual, no-fuss seafood restaurants where it's a bit noisy but the atmosphere is laid back.Because it was the first time we were there, I decided to split a hot and cold seafood combo with a friend to get a sample of a number of things. Hot combo is $18.25 vs cold combo $17.75. Both were good, but I ended up liking the hot combo more. While the ceviche, raw oysters and clams on the cold combo was good, there was a huge amount of salad that didn't have much dressing on it. The cold shrimp were good, but hard to peel. The fried calamari and clam chowder were both okay (chowder was on the saltier side). Another friend ordered the Dungeness crab platter, but was disappointed with how little crab there was in comparison to the amount of salad. Oyster shooters are standard price ($3.50).This probably wouldn't be on the top of my list of places to eat at in Santa Barbara, but I certainly wouldn't be against coming here again with friends.",3 star rating,Clarice C.
9/21/2020,"Las Vegas, NV","The service was wonderful! We started with a cup of clam chowder. It's one of the best I've had on the West coast for sure. I wish I got a whole bowl. There was definitely a lot of clams in there. Unlike some that have cheap fillers. It's a must try. The garlic clams were yummy; garlicky and quite filling. Our entrees were the ciopino and fish and chips. A lot of seafood in the ciopino. It was alright. Not terrible. But not something I'd get again. But i can see why its a popular dish. Fish and chips were on point! Fish was nice and crunchy on the inside, soft and flavorful inside. I used both the cocktail and tartar sauces. The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned too. Definitely a costar of the dish.",4 star rating,Ruby R.
1/15/2020,"Novelty, OH","Referred here by locals while looking for a local joint with seafood.  Wed night in January; cool weather but inside was packed and outside was comfortable for us midwesterners. Started with beer boiled shrimp which were solid.  Clam chowder was outstanding.  Could've eaten five bowls but one cup was very filling.  Entrees were both blackened fish; one sea bass and one mahi.  Both very good.  High point of the night (and really, of our trip in general) was the service. Everyone we dealt with was attentive and on top of things.  However, if you ever visit, we would strongly suggest you be seated at one of Gabi's tables. She is without a doubt one of the best servers we've ever had.  Friendly, knowledgeable and very outgoing. She made the night for us.",5 star rating,Jim A.

5/16/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Brophy Bros is such a classic place to try in Santa Barbara! It's located on the harbor so the best place to park is in the Santa Barbara harbor parking lot.  With the amazing views, delicious food, fun cocktails and amazing service what else can make this place even better?!This place can get very crowded so I would recommend to go here on a off day or night or just be prepared to have to wait! The restaurant itself is not that big which is why the wait time can be long but it's worth it!They have some of the best clam chowder I have ever had here! It comes in a bowl or a cup and they even have an awesome soup/salad combo! They have delicious mussels and clams here! Even the crab cakes and fish and chips are so fresh! I love the crispness on the fish it's so good and not too overpowering. This past time we finally decided to the sea bass and wow it was probably the most delicious fish I've ever had! The butter sauce totally made it and I loved it! The fish was very fresh and not fishy at all. I can't wait to come back and to try it again! We also tried the cocktails of la paloma and the mai tai! Both were super delicious!Overall I also have a great time here! With the freshest food, incredible views, and fancy cocktails this place is a great place to come any day of the week!

5/17/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","It's been a while since I've been here. Definitely one of my favorite stops in SB.Place is popular dining destination and often times there's long wait. Fortunately, We came on weekday late afternoon and it was hardly crowded. Got seated right away outside on the balcony which offers amazing view of the harbor. Definitely the best seats in the house. The restaurant is located on 2nd floor, accessible both by stair and elevator. They don't take reservation, but Worth the wait. We started off with a craft beer and a cup of the clam chowder. Their clam chowder was really good and had a good amount clams in it. Excellent texture and flavor...reminds me of delicious clam chowder I enjoyed during my visit to New England. Between two of us, we ordered seafood cippino and seafood pasta. Love the cippino, which in my opinion is best around. The broth was plentiful, super flavorful . It was loaded with lots of seafood, which was perfectly cooked to plump tenderness (check out picture and video that I posted. Be prepared to drool!) Our meal came with complimentary bread, perfect for soaking up the incredible juices. We must have requested at least 3-4 more helpings of bread, so addictingly good. Seafood pasta was fabulous too. The shrimp and scallops were big and juicy, accompanied with lovely sauce. We both ate every morsel, continuing to eat it for the flavor long after we were satisfied, probably would have licked the bowl if there wasn't too many people around...hahaha!All in all, fabulous seaside meal worthy of many more returns. Good friendly and quick service too.",4 star rating,Leo C.

11/22/2019,"Santa Maria, CA","Me and my daughter just happened upon this place on a Sunday while we were waiting to head to a baseball game.  We put our name on the list and was told there would be a 20 minute wait, the place was packed.  It turned out to only be 5 minutes before we were seated.We got seated outside right next to an open window next to a bar where people were also standing being served drinks and food.  So it was SUPER crowded.  The wait staff have a hard time squeezing through there, probably not the best place to let people stand.  They're literally right next to your table, and the table behind you is really close as well.  You can't scoot your chair out very far, you really have to count on others to be polite.  The gentleman behind me was not.  He kept bumping me.  But... beyond that.  The food was delicious and the view was beautiful.  We ordered the peel and eat shrimp to start and they were perfect.  I then got the clam chowder which was flavorful and hearty before my Swordfish which was served with rice.  The swordfish was flaky and delicious.My daughter ordered the shrimp pasta, which was way too much for her to eat.  We definitely ordered too much food but we wanted to try it all.  There may have been bread as well?  Everything was so good.Aside from the crowded area and people bumping into you, it's for sure worth it.  It's pretty pricey, it was around $70 for our lunch, but i will be back.",5 star rating,Brandi G.

4/24/2018,"Houston, TX","When asked where can I get the combo of scenery for lunch by the water, dining with locals, good seafood and no white table cloth in Santa Barbara..... I got several recommendations (including my Uber driver) that I needed to go to Brophy Bros. The +2000 Yelp reviews sealed the deal too!Settings: small quaint upper level resturant which sits in the Santa Barbara Harbor. Very very rustic with  a narrow deck with tables and bar overlooking the harbor with open windows. Resturant is small, so expect a wait but seems to turn tables pretty quickly. Food: Started with steam shrimp which is served w/ cocktail sauce and a lump of horseradish with the sauce. As an east coast it's been awhile since I've had good steamed shrimp. The shrimp were fresh, sizable and well seasoned. Definitely a starter I recommend. For my actual lunch I took a different turn. I had a shark sandwich. Coming from a area where cod and tilapia (neither I care for) is commonly offered in many restaurants, I thought I would try the shark. I would give the sandwich 3 1/2 stars. It was grilled, fresh (which I liked) but lacked seasoning but all in all not a bad sandwich. Sides slaws and fries.I would definitely go back to try other dishes including another round of the steam shrimp.",4 star rating,David G.

3/31/2021,"Mukilteo, WA","3.5 stars. Extra half for the delicious clam chowder. Tried this spot for dinner as last resort due to no reservations available elsewhere. Smaller menu than expected-maybe due to Covid. Outside seating only also from Covid restrictions. Nice patio with heaters around but not putting off much warmth. Wife chose bowl of chowder with side salad and after a few easily answered questions I chose fish sandwich with a side cup of chowder. Today's fish was Mahi-mahi, grilled. We both thought the chowder was very good. Stand your spoon thick, flavorful, and full of clams. She finished every bite and I easily could have eaten more. Her salad of mixed greens was pretty standard but the garlic Parmesan dressing was unique and delicious IMO. Another item we would have enjoyed more of. Unfortunately the fish sand was pretty much a miss. I will say the fish itself was darn good. But, who serves a fresh fish sandwich on sliced toasted bread? Where is the sturdy bun? Also, the bread had no dressing of any kind, just a tiny bit of tartar on the side. Leaf lettuce, a fat tomato slice, and some ridiculously thick slices of raw red onion. Once you put some tartar on it it just slid around and was impossible to eat like a sandwich, falling all over my plate. Once deconstructed and eaten with a fork it was tasty but not what I expected when I ordered it. Add in the difficult time it appeared the server to pay attention to our needs out on the side patio and we left disappointed.",3 star rating,Brian M.

6/10/2018,"Redwood City, CA","The restaurant wait here was ridiculously long. The heaters outside dont work very well and I was freezing throughout dinner. The hot appetizers were pretty good. Mussels, clam chowder, oysters, etc. Super fresh and tasty. However, the main entree (which took forever to be served by the way), was way overcooked and dry. Seabass is actually a rather forgiving fish, so I'm not sure how they could have eff-ed it up so bad. Service left much to be desired. The server didnt bother to let us know that our order was going to take a long time. They all seemed to just be standing at the entrance with the hostess instead of actually waiting on tables. It was a super disappointing experience to dine at the restaurant :( However, I highly recommend the bar downstairs where they serve drinks and food as well. You get your food much quicker, it is less crowded, and they have plenty of options. Oh, and their bloody mary is amazing.",3 star rating,Christina N.

There's literally no room to move around at the bar when it's super crowded, and people just leave their stuff on the counter to ""save"" their spots.We ordered:- hot combo: shrimp was very plain and a little overboiled/shrimp was old, oysters rockefeller tasted a little sour even before I squeezed lemon over it (which is a bummer because I LOVE oysters), the topping on the baked clams were really unpleasant and didn't work with the clams at all. - ciopinno: super fishy tasting, the sauce was incredibly bland. It came highly recommended so this was a disappointment too- mahi mahi: incredibly small fillet of mahi mahi, and really dry and bland. The side of salsa had no flavor either, which made me really sad.I really do not get the hype about this place, and I would definitely not come back.",2 star rating,Claudia C.

The wait can be ridiculous, especially in the summer, but taking a nice walk in the harbor and enjoying the ocean is the key. Plus, if in a rush, just stop at on the alley downstairs.

Reaching over your plate to pick up a used dish.... or forgetting that you asked for a straw, even if it was a paper one for 10 minutes... couldn't be that busy, social distancing right? Less clientele so why would it take so long? The food was okay I guess. Had way better dishes inland. My lady thought the chowder was really good but her bass was a little over cooked. Not pictured. The cioppino was not the best ever and at $17.00 don't waste your money. Sauce too thick, used what appeared to be canned tomatoes, who puts grated cheese on top? Throw in six mussels, three clams and three baby shrimp... tada! Nope. The calamari was really good and the house salad was delicious. The cole slaw was good too, probably out of a plastic tub. That being said I would go back but just to sit at the bar and look out at that view of the harbor, have a glass of wine or two and enjoy the view.",3 star rating,G S.
10/14/2019,"Simi Valley, CA","Three reasons why it gets three stars:1. The crab cakes were good and is a definitely must try!2. The shrimp scampi was actually amazing in the sauce that it comes with, so that's another must try!3. The real reason why it is getting three stars is because service is everything in ANY restaurant you go to. Service started off great, waitress was attentive, but once we paid the bill and left a 20% tip, my guests and I, which was only three of us, stayed at the table to finish our drinks and we're looking at funny videos from a trip we went to. Point is the waitress rudely told my friend to lower the volume on his phone, yet other guests were just as loud and we  were sitting OUTSIDE...where it is already a loud environment! I really want to give it 4 stars, but if I give 4 stars it changes it to, ""Yay! I'm a fan"", but I am not. The only reason why it's not getting 1 star, is because the food was decent, the view is nice and also the manager was extremely empathetic to the situation and it wasn't her fault at all that her waitress was obviously having an off day. I have never met a manager that attentive and she was incredible at handling and diffusing the situation. I cannot thank her enough for salvaging the rest of our evening for how poor the waitress treated paying customers.",3 star rating,Melissa C.

1/27/2019,"San Jose, CA","I came here for dinner today, on a Saturday. We came early, around 5. The wait was about 25 mins. First off, I really like the openness of the restaurant, you get a nice view of the harbor with all the boats right next to you if you sit outside. The windows are all open, so the restaurant merges itself with the outside really well. The kitchen is also an open kitchen and you can see the chefs at work. The restaurant has low ceiling and a nice old time cozy feel to it. The noise level is a little bit up there, so I'd say if you're looking for more privacy and quietness the environment here probably isn't for you.We had a light dinner and only ordered two items- the seafood boil and the clam chowder bowl with salad combo. The seafood boil was a definite star. The clams and mussels tasted very sweet and fresh. They were delightful. The broth it was in gave it a nice garlicky touch. They also included two rockefeller oysters and baked clams. The clam chowder is good, but no matter how many places that serve clam chowder I try, I think my favorite will always be Boudin's. The portion was very big however and the salad was delightful. In conclusion, my dinner here was delightful, the portions are good and worth it at its value.

12/1/2019,"Palo Alto, CA","Amazing seafood prepared to perfection!  Our party of five ordered the Dungeness Crab Platter for appetizer and we liked it so much that we ordered a second.  The fish and chips were moist and tender with a nice light crispy beer batter- best we have ever tasted.  The Seafood Chiopinno had a light tomato sauce which didn't overpower the fish or shellfish.  The shrimp scampi were tasty.  Even the french bread was great especially to dip into the New England Clam chowder.  Excellent service as well.Negatives were that we had to wait 30 minutes for a table (we were told it would be about 45 minutes).  Restaurant is very small and crowded, so much so that chairs are bumping into each other.  Would have been great to have crab in the chiopinno.  Overall, still a five star meal.  We will be back next time we are in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Drake L.

11/5/2017,"Allen, TX","My dude and I had a lunch date here. We thought we should be cliche and have a seafood lunch at the pier, thinking we would have a great view and the food would be ""just okay"" (as we experience with pier-side seafood restaurant). However, we were surprised with the food...Before I go into detail, let's talk about the restaurant. We weren't able to get a table right by the balcony but there was bar seating that faced the balcony (major props to whoever designed the restaurant layout). We had a great view while sitting at the bar. We thought we didn't order a lot but I guess we did: fried calamari, fish and chips, and a bowl of clam chowder and salad. Everything was delicious. The calamari was great, we devoured it. The fish had an awesome batter: super light, crispy, and tasty. The fries were great too. The clam chowder was hearty and delicious. They did not skimp on the clam... I had a good amount of clam in every spoonful I had. The salad... I forgot... haha. I was too focused on the seafood at that point. Props to the chefs alongside by the indoor seating area (more props to the restaurant design!)Service was great too. The bartender who took our order was really cool and friendly. The lady who served our food was also helpful and quick to serve our order. Side note: I thought it was funny when she gave our our last food item, asking if we really ordered the fish and chips, in which we replied, ""yes, we are fatasses, we didn't think it was enough food but I guess it was"" HAHA! Overall, we had an amazing lunch here. I was surprised with the quality of the food, along with the great atmosphere and nice and friendly service. I would definitely come back whenever I am in Santa Barbara, thanks!",5 star rating,Mafel L.

3/3/2019,"San Jose, CA",I honestly thought this place might be overrated but  I was pleasantly not disappointed! I came for lunch on Sunday so thought it would be super crowded. Parking was difficult but I luckily got a spot in the 90 minute lot (which is free). The wait was 30 minutes but we found a seat at the bar pretty quickly. If you can't get a seat outside then I actually recommend the bar because you still get a view (facing the water). My friend and I ordered the sea bass and seafood pasta. The portions are surprisingly big and all entrees come with sides like the clam chowder and salad. Both were flavorful and cooked well. Service was quick and servers were nice and efficient. Overall I would definitely check it out if you're in SB and want seafood at a casual place.,5 star rating,Stephanie K.

I'm three months pregnant, and craving these very specific fish and chips. Fresh seafood, light and airy batter with perfectly crisped fries. The service was was amazing, and the ambient was loud, cheerful and fitting for a harbor restaurant. The views of the gorgeous mountains didn't hurt either!  Wish this placed shipped food!

10/3/2017,"Silicon Valley, CA","The wait was definitely not worth it on a Saturday evening.Our group of six wanted a nicer seafood spot that could accommodate those who were craving fresh fish and ones who didn't want seafood. Brophy Bros was one of the first ones that popped up on yelp. We called ahead and they said it was first come first serve for spots, so we walked upstairs and were handed a buzzer and told that the wait would be 30-45 minutes. There's a beautiful harbor where all the boats are docked, so there's some view...but once the sun goes down it's huddle up and beat the cold! There are other eatery spots in the same area, but it's not a lot of diversity--there's sushi, and small tokens shop that helped us kill some time. We ended up waiting for an hour, and by then we all felt like we were students again pulling all-nighters to stay awake by 10PM.Immediately after being seated, we were given complimentary sourdough bread and butter--SUCH a lifesaver! We mauled through baskets of them, and the servers were all so friendly and kept on offering us more. I ordered the fish sandwich with fries, which was ahi for that night. I wish I could have asked for it medium cooked through, with a bit of rare ahi in the middle, but it's alright. The ahi was fresh and yummy...as well as the fries. I had a taste of my friend's clam chowder which was the best consistency--not too thick or creamy! It seems like those who ordered the seafood pasta loved it the best. My friend who ordered the crabcakes did not like it and ended up sending it back. We think she got food poisoning because right when she got home she threw up. However, none of us had seafood problems and our stomachs were fine.The space itself is great! It's homey and warm, and the service was very friendly and quick. They probably know how long we have to wait to get seated, so I really appreciate their service. Shoutout to the staff! The portion sizes are huge, and they really let us go ham on the complimentary sourdough bread. However, at that point in the night...for a large group of six, we were just done with waiting. I think the experience would have been better if we arrived earlier and didn't have to sit out in the cold for over an hour. Overall, a long wait...but not worth it for our party of six.",3 star rating,Jodi H.
9/4/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Everytime I drive up to Santa Barbara, my first stop is to Brophy Bros. Seafood is my favorite food and theirs is always fresh. I usually get the fried shrimp or fried clams, clam chowder and sop it all up with the fresh bread they offer. The prices are reasonable, in the $15 dollar range.There's usually a wait however it's located right on the marina, so there's a wonderful view in the meantime. I have never waited longer than 20 minutes. There's indoor and outdoor seating plus self seating at the bar. The noise level is high however you tune it out after a while. My waiter/waitress have always been friendly and attentive. My issue is with my last experience. I came in this past labor day Monday and was seated facing the kitchen. While I was eating, I noticed one of the cooks (wearing a black hat with a red oval and white center) pointing at me and saying something to another cook (wearing a black hat that said ""Devour""). The cook with the Devour hat turned around and stared at me and they continued to talk. I was there approximately 30 minutes and they continued to stare at me to the point I was uncomfortable, irritated and was unable to finish my food. The cook with the oval logo on his hat kept walking behind the wall and coming out starting at me with a mean look. The cook with the Devour hat would paused, eat something and stare. I ended up paying and leaving and going elsewhere to eat. Although I love the food here, I more than likely won't return. I'll find another seafood restaurant where I'm comfortable eating.",2 star rating,Bernard C.

9/13/2019,"Oakland, CA","Since I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, I don't harbor the warmest feelings toward crowds at waterfront eateries - Fisherman's Wharf evokes overpriced seafood that's not always fresh or prepared to bring out the best flavors, and food snobs who expect gourmet touches on everything. My parents came here once before and enjoyed themselves though, so I let them guide me through the experience for my first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. Because I was tired and didn't have much of an appetite, I only ordered a cup of their clam chowder while my dad got a shrimp and crab salad, and my mom got the cioppino. Maybe it's because we actively avoided any kind of fried stuff, but all the dishes showcased the freshness of the seafood delightfully. The shrimp and crab on the salad were simple and delicious, and the salad had a lovely clear tangy dressing. The cioppino was piping hot and contained juicy chunks of the local red snapper. And the chowder with the free bread was a hearty way to satisfy my stomach. The girl who served us was also very nice and attentive - she made me feel comfortable and that was pretty important for this out-of-towner! Turns out my parents really know how to pick their restaurants.",5 star rating,Sheena C.
1/2/2019,"Fontana, CA","I just didn't have the greatest experience here. The food was ok, but if it weren't beachfront, I don't think it'd be open. The staff all seem so young and inexperienced. We ordered baked clams for an appetizer, and into my second one, I realized there's bacon in it. It really bothers me, because I really think that there are enough people that cannot eat pork that it should be clearly stated on the menu. I don't think I should have to ask: ""Hey, is there any pork hidden in here?""  I never want to be confrontational in any way, but I didn't appreciate that she didn't even ask if she could get me something else instead. So the meals come out and my husband had ordered clam chowder and salad. I specifically said when we ordered that when it came out I was going to taste his, and if I liked it get my own cup too. They even put the soup in front of me on accident. I just don't understand how nobody mentioned, ""Hey there's bacon in this clam chowder"", after I was so upset about eating bacon in the baked clam. I literally had to ask about the clam chowder, and they said yes there's bacon in it. I'm really glad that I thought to ask, since the baked clam thing happened.I just think that the servers need to be trained better on how to meet the needs of their customers. The first thing was a mistake, but the second thing shouldn't of happened. The menu should include what is in each dish.By the way, my tuna melt was pretty gross. It's sad that my favorite thing at this ""nice restaurant"" was the fries. Also, it took forever to get our food ordered and served-but it was New Year's Day and they were slammed. Probably the whole lukewarm experience can be attributed to them being just too busy.",3 star rating,Steffanie Y.

There is usually a long wait, but they give you a buzzer so you're able to walk around the deck as you wait for your seat. The service is very nice and our waitress was friendly and gave good questions. I ended up settling for the fish and chips with some coleslaw and it was delicious!

The calamari was nice and fresh. The tartar sauce goes very well with the calamari. The hot sampler was okay. There was oysters and had cheese on top. I didn't enjoy that much since the cheese seem to cover most of the oyster to be honest. I enjoyed the garlic clams/mussels though. The clams were super big and delicious.

We had a great view of the harbor and got to see the all the action of the bartenders as they churned out drinks and also prepared some of the dishes. The staff behind the bar made us feel comfortable and treated us as if we were locals, this is something we really appreciated. We really enjoyed the overall ambiance, from the casual setting, location, views, and music. As for the food, we ordered the following we ordered the ceviche to start which was a hefty portion, very fresh, but the flavor was on the blander side (hot sauce helped!). We also got two cups of New England clam chowder which was packed with clams and was very thick (fiancé loved this dish). I thought the soup was ok, but lacking the the clam flavor, but I'm also spoiled because I live by Swan Oyster Depot, which has a thinner soup, but it packed with clam flavor. For the mains we ordered the New York Steak, which was just ok, and the Seabass, which was perfectly cooked and the seasoning was just right.

We were placed on the outside patio and the view was pretty, but we literally felt so close to everyone else's table. For drinks, we ordered the Blue Hawaiian (meh pass on this) and the Firestone beer. We ordered oyster shooters as well, which to be honest I don't what a ""good"" oyster shooter is supposed to taste like. The alcohol in it made me want to gag since it was chilling at the top. For main entrees, we ordered the sea bass (if you must order a dish, order this one) and the mahi mahi (uninspiring flavor even with the mango relish thing). The coleslaw and fries were just okay.

5/21/2017,"Houston, TX","My boyfriend introduced me to the philosophy of finding new places to eat by following the lines. Having done that with Brophy Bros, I do think that the wait is worth the amazing seafood you get to try out. There seems to be nothing that can actually go wrong.If you don't like to wait, the bar and downstairs dining room are open seating. Spending an extended amount of time at the harbor can be chilly, though, so we were lucky to find seating on the upper deck, inside. The buzzer went off after an hour, which gave us plenty of time to look at a recreated galleon that had docked for a Santa Barbara Maritime Museum event, and  take a look at the Santa Barbara Fish Market.Marissa C. and I both got the seafood pasta with a cup of clam chowder, while Emily L. got the fish and chips with coleslaw and fries. We were a little confused as to why the entree menu said that all dishes came with coleslaw, AND choice of side green salad or cup of clam chowder, AND fries or rice pilaf, when our waitress only asked if we wanted clam chowder or salad with our pasta. That should be clarified, but in their defense, I was already full after chowing down on the bread basket and the chowder with oyster crackers. Taking home the extra pasta was the treat.The seafood here is so tender and fresh. After trying a bit of the flaky fish, I've concluded that they're trained fish and chip pros. I've eaten many an overcooked scallop in my life, and to be able to get a handful that weren't tough at first bite was phenomenal. The shrimp included were also massive, and went well with the provided lemon wedge. However, the best part was coming to the point where I realized that there was more than enough for leftovers, while the dish was still piping hot. (And, it's JUST as good the second day.)Someone called Brophy Bros life-changing, and while I think that's certainly an exaggeration, I won't deny that they revitalized my hopes that cooked seafood can indeed be done well.",5 star rating,Gwen W.

10/7/2020,"Santa Clarita, CA","Food was good but a lot of stuff was unavailable on the menu, it they let me order each of the items first. I ended up with my THIRD choice item. Service was decent and I know it wasn't the fault of our server, but no compensation was offered by anyone. Instead, I had to request that they bring my kids' food first so that they didn't have to wait any longer.",3 star rating,Cheryl C.
3/17/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I feel like this is the one place in town that both tourists and locals agree on... which may be why it's always so packed. The location absolutely can't be beat, especially if you're lucky enough to snag a table outside. The garlic baked clams are one of my all-time favorite SB dishes... order them immediately.",5 star rating,Samantha M.

If you have ever visited or even driven through Santa Barbara and not stopped at Brophy's...you need to go back.Living in SB many years, this place was always a favorite. Whether filled with tourists or locals, sunshine or fog- Brophy's is always such a wonderful experience. It's not a place to eat and move on, it's a place to gather, enjoy and soak in Santa Barbara. Mussels, clam chowder, linguine with clams...I could go on and on. Brophy's is a staple of the area for good reason. Wish I was there now.",5 star rating,Bree M.

11/26/2018,"Fontana, CA","I love this place! Every time I'm around the SLO area, I come here. The amount of tater tots that you get is amazing. For the price, this place is really worth it. I ordered 2 cups of clam chowder and tater tots and it was around 13 bucks. The clam chowder is amazing and doesn't make me feel nasty or heavy after eating it. It's light and the cup also comes with bread as well. Other places I've been to usually don't provide the bread on the side like this place does when you ask for a cup. I like how they added that in there. The bread is soft and comes with butter on the side if you want to add it. For me, I usually don't like adding butter to my bread so I'm glad that this place always gives me the option to not have the butter on the bread or in the clam chowder. Note: there's a ton of birds that will be chilling around the benches where you eat your food. They are there to eat your bread crumbs and scraps after you leave... or while you eat. Lol. Anyway, careful when you sit down cause you might sit on bird poop.",5 star rating,Tracy L.

If you are really rebellious and like some fire, try it with the ghost pepper vodka they have - I dare you.

8/20/2017,"Long Beach, CA","My friends and I were driving through SB and decided to stop at Brophy Bros to eat lunch. We had to go up the stairs of the place to grab a wait buzzer thingy, which allowed us to walk around the surrounding dock area. We waited about 25 mins until they buzzed us and we were seated indoors on the 2nd floor. The space felt crampy and stuffy. Here's what we ordered: Steamed clams w/ broth ($14.50): The clams were decent, but the broth tasted bland. We tried squeezing more lemon juice in the broth, but it didn't improve the taste by much. (2/5)Calamari ($10.25): One of the best calamari I've had. Nicely fried and the texture of the squid was not chewy at all. (4/5)Breaded Bay Scallops ($9.75): I'm a huge fan of scallops and this breaded version did not disappoint. (4/5)If I ever come back, I'd prefer to sit outside so I could enjoy the fresh ocean air and order anything without broth.",3 star rating,Sandy H.

While we were in Santa Barbara one evening we decided to try out the Brophy Brothers restaurant in Santa Barbara. The service was good and we felt welcomed. The food is not the same. The crabcakes were much smaller and didn't have the flavor like the Ventura restaurant.  Even the Side salad dressing tasted different. We were very disappointed. We shared our concerns with our Waiter and the crabcakes were removed from our bill.,3 star rating,Patti W.

Unfortunately, the quality isn't the same as we remembered. When we sat down, they brought a large basket of bread. As we remember, the bread was always warm and fresh. When we brought this to our young servers attention she told us that the bread is never warm but offered to bring us a new basket of bread. We both were surprised that the new bread was just as stale at the initial basket. I ordered the Steamed clams that were plentiful. But they were gritty and chewy like old rubber. Certainly not the quality that I remembered. However, the clam chowder was very good and helped soften the day old bread.",3 star rating,Alan R.
3/10/2018,"Las Vegas, NV","Yes, the seafood here is excellent. The fish was juicy and perfectly cooked. Served with your choice of sides, and the fries and chowder make a great combination. Food is banged out and on your table before you can even finish ordering it. It's an impressive operation that's designed for maximum turnover, and it's certainly a little tumultuous. Show up at dinner time, and chances are there'll be a little wait. You can also order some of the menu downstairs in the bar...Let's eat!",4 star rating,Jocelyn C.

That's when you know it's good!It was chilly when we dined, so they had most of the outdoor area closed up (which kind of sucked). Sitting outside to soak up the views of the harbor is primo. Service was friendly but really slow. I'm surprised they weren't try to turn tables quicker as there was a line out the door. We started with the ceviche and got a huge tasty portion. Try the clam chowder as this is something they're known for. It's delicious! We also had the fish and chips and the portions were huge and worth it. The prices are great here for what you get.

3/29/2018,"Brooklyn, NY","This place is great and came highly recommended.We were told parking would be tough, so we opted to take an uber. The restaurant is a bit tucked away, but we did eventually find it. On the lower level they have a bar space with an abridged menu where you can order some fried seafood, their chowder, and some booze. We decided to just get drinks down there and hope to be seated at a real table upstairs. We succeeded! We were able to close out our tab downstairs and go upstairs to the outside deck that was closed off and had wondrous heaters to keep us warm.The reason this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is that anything outside of the seafood just wasn't good. We started with the clam chowder and it was phenomenal. One of my faves, ever. Then I ordered the shrimp scampi with rice pilaf and my boyfriend got the fried calamari. The shrimp and the calamari were excellent. The calamari was particularly tender and easy to eat. But the rice pilaf was bad and the cole slaw that came with both meals was totally under seasoned. Would definitely come back, but next time I know what to stick to.",4 star rating,Katie B.

Being born in SB my parents always wanted me to try Brophy Bros when we come to visit as they came often when they were younger. Well, upon ordering the highly toted Seafood pasta, I barely could get down more than a single bite. It literally tasted like food straight from the sea; like netted from the sea and plopped directly into my pasta. It was nothing but salt I could taste. My girlfriend who was visiting SB with us for the first time got the clam chowder which she was also disappointed with.I wrote a review for this occasion months ago when we visited. It seems as if Brophy Bros had somehow deleted my review which in more detail explained how the seafood pasta was underwhelming if not gross.

12/14/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","My husband Matt B. is a Santa Barbara native with the palate of a white eight-year-old. One of the few foods he likes is fish and chips, but he also has a vivid memory of going to Brophy Bros. when he was little and hating it so much that he called the place ""Barfy Brothers"" for many years. (Reader, I married who?) I only recently prevailed on him to go back and give the place another chance as an adult, if only so his food-loving wife could finally try one of the iconic eateries of his hometown.We went for lunch the day after Thanksgiving, with our friends Tristan C. and Brian G., who are apparently always down for Brophy. We showed up before noon and the place was already packed. We put our name down and received a buzzer, and were told we were looking at an hour to hour and a half wait.This was my first time visiting the Santa Barbara Harbor, so we took the opportunity to take a long walk and had to hurry back when our buzzer started going off before a full hour was up. We were seated inside--alas, the outdoor seating was even more sought after--right in the middle of the bustling restaurant. I liked the lively, casual, seaside vibe. Service was brisk and friendly, and we had a relaxing meal.I started my lunch with Brophy's Bloody Mary, a decent bloody made with locally owned Yacht Club Vodka, served with a seasoned salt rim, a wedge of lime, and a fresh, leafy stalk of celery. I don't particularly care what kind of vodka goes into a Bloody Mary, but this was a good drink, flavorful with a nice thickness and spice. Matt had a can of Rincon IPA, which was also refreshing.I was still recovering from my two huge Thanksgiving meals the day before, so I decided to order on the light side--a cup of Brophy's New England clam chowder and a cold seafood combo. The food was solid. I loved the chunky clam chowder, so soothing and rich, served with oyster crackers. There was complimentary white bread, too, which is always good for sopping. The cold combo was a neat spread with three ounces of crab meat, 3/4 cup of ceviche, two oysters, two clams, and eight peel and eat shrimp. I guess this wasn't exactly an ascetic's lunch, but it wasn't too decadent. I thought the oysters, clams, crab, and shrimp were all excellent, super fresh and tasty. The ceviche was less impressive, without any zest, but I wasn't mad about it.I was a little jealous, though, of Matt's beer battered fish and chips. I tried a piece and it was delicious, the batter flaky, the fish fried up just right. The fries were on point, too, well seasoned and crispy. Matt was extremely pleased with his lunch, praising the once reviled Barfy Brothers for their excellent fish and chips. I have a feeling we'll be back more often now that the picky one has been converted.",4 star rating,Steph C.

The bartenders were awesome (ask for Dominick) as we're the waiters. Brophy's sports several small and large party tables outside, overlooking the docks, where you can watch the boats come in and out and enjoy the beautiful California weather.  There's plenty of indoor seating too, if outside is not your cup of tea. For satiating your hunger...try the bowl of clam chowder (add some tobacco for a nice kick) or try the ahi tuna poke salad. Tons of fresh ahi, and fresh salad greens!  Absolutely delicious. I would also recommend the oyster shooter (with vodka) if you love oysters. Absolutely nom worthy ;)I'm making this a must visit place when I come back here again.

It was standing room only. You walk up steep stairs. Some elderly folks in front of us were told it was a 45 min wait, but there is no where to wait unless they walked down the steep treacherous stairs again! The lady found a seat at the bar to wait.We were also given a buzzer/beeper and told 45 min, but when 2 seats opened at the bar, we hopped on them! There is no where to stand and wait for a seat. You are constantly being bumped into by servers and patrons. You literally can't stand anywhere to be out of the way. You could walk back down the steps and walk the pier while you wait.Bar service was friendly. They use hot plates to steam mussels, clams, shrimp over beer in cook pots. The salad dressing was the BOMB - parmesan ranch or parmesan caesar, I don't remember which but sooooo good and house made. Salad was great. Husband liked his burger. They didn't charge for soda water.Many folks were standing at the open windows by the bar on the outside deck. The tables out there are CRAMMED together to fit the most patrons in the tightest space possible. If you want to feel like you are in ""Santa Barbara"" and want the pier/harbor experience, you'll like it. If you want to have drinks in a tight space with sailing folks, this is your place.

1/16/2018,"Fresno, CA","Enjoyed this place very much, nice fresh fish, good setting. Right off the pier service was good, even for a wednesday night they were quite busy so good for them. Chowder, well flavored I had huge chunks of clams, good seasoning and not to runny. Having a spot like this to get fresh fish is the way to go. Would love to try there calamari and clams next time. Don't let the busy part bother you the turn around rate looked fairly quick.",4 star rating,Anthony T.

2/3/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","I have now been here twice and have ordered two different things, so this post is warranted: food is tasteless!! The location and vibe of the restaurant are great and it is certainly a popular spot, but food is not worth a visit. The first time I went I got the sea bass, with the Cajun spices, and it was dry dry dry and no flavor. The second time, I went as a friend was visiting and had heard of the place and wanted to check it out, I got the seafood pasta--tasteless! The scallops in the pasta were like rubber and the shrimp and pasta had no taste. The sauce was bland, as if there wasn't really a sauce at all. I have no idea what the fuss over this place is about, but I wouldn't recommend it. Only saving graces are the service and clam chowder.",2 star rating,Sarah W.

We had the fish and chips which was delicious with a hearty portion of fries. We also ordered the fried calamari which was okay, but also came with a large amount of fries.

11/27/2017,"Monterey Park, CA","This is one of the best places Santa Barbara has to offer. Being just next to the Santa Barbara Harbor, you get the freshest seafood around. My buddies and I stumbled across this place when we were planning a trip to Pismo beach. We had a fun filled day and knew that we were going to work up an appetite. We luckily found parking in the private lot and made our way to the restaurant.  Immediately, we were greeted by friendly faces. The host led us to the bar area where we started with drinks and appetizers. The oysters were really fresh and tasty. We added some cocktail sauce and a hint of lemon juice to perfect it. The fried scallop appetizer was also pretty good. For the main course, all 3 of us got our own seafood pasta. Man, that's one of the best seafood pastas I have ever had. The texture of the linguini was on point. The Parmesan cheese, white wine, and basil really brought out the flavors of the dish.Warning: Expect large shrimps and sautéed sea scallops on top of delicious linguini. If you don't appreciate seafood the same way I do, this is not the place for you. It certainly hit the spot for me!",5 star rating,Kevin L.

11/2/2017,"New Smyrna Beach, FL","I really like Brophy Bros. and this is the second time that, during a cruise stop in Santa Barbara, we chose to visit there. We even asked a local to recommend either Santa Barbara Shellfish Company or Brophy's and he said ""Brophy's, bro.""So we got seated outside after a decent wait at noon on a hot Tuesday. One thing I will say (after only two visits): this place is never quiet, nor is there never a line. It is not intimate, unless you mean people practically looking into your drink from every direction.Even though we were seated outside, there were (mostly) guys with drinks standing on that small walking strip between us/our table and the wall of windows that leads into the crowded interior of the restaurant. It was these guys that were practically (unknowingly) including us on every adventure/story/laugh and which we were unable to escape, they were so close. Had they decided to stare at us, instead of being so animatedly engaged with each other, they would have seen that we ordered rather regular Brophy stuff: a bowl of their Chowdah and a Fish and Chips (nothing to see here--drink your beer). Both of these were excellent as usual and, while the service was a bit rushed and then non-existent (we chalked this up to the crazy mad rush to lunch here), we were more than happy.So: be prepared to WAIT. Be prepared for LOUD conversation. Be prepared to be closely packed. But also be prepared for consistently good food (if two widely separated times makes a trend).",4 star rating,Glenn H.
2/4/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Drove out to Santa Barbara for lunch. We had Brophy Bros for their seafood and wasn't disappointed. During the weekend you'll probably wait for a table a little longer. Even on a weekday for lunch, we waited for a patio table (outside) for about 30 minutes. It's worth the wait though...you get an awesome view of the little harbor and the SB Pier.The seafood was good. Plus they had the Anchor Steam (SF beer)...you gotta try it! Oyster Rockefeller...delicious. The chowder is also good. My friend had the Mahi Mahi which was good as well. I liked the side of mango salsa that accompanied the fish. The service was good. Just didn't like sitting outside next to the standing bar. The people standing around drinking were a bit too close to our table.",4 star rating,Ticha B.
6/7/2019,"Littleton, CO","Got a recommendation to come here with my wife on a getaway for the first night out. Staff and ambiance was spot on for a dock side dinner, but the food (didn't try anything fried) wasn't what we expected.You'd think that being ON the water near an ocean you'd get a lot of local fish or crab choices watching crabbers & urchin divers unload their hauls and locals fishing on the pier talking about halibut but NOPE... the only local items on the menu are the Sea Bass and ceviche. I'm sure there's a great reason like fisherman get better prices selling to exporters, who knows. Anyway, our seat was outside (beautiful!!!) watched the fresh caught seafood get packed up in trucks and our expectations couldn't have been higher. Knowing of the 2 options for local items, she had the Cioppino and I had the Sea Bass. Sea Bass was decent, but her dish tasted like Campbell spaghetti O's!! The waiter was awesome and simply asked what else can we get you. She had shrimp cocktail... I'd go for the fried foods next time.",3 star rating,Justin S.
2/7/2016,"Costa Mesa, CA","We were looking for a great seafood restaurant for dinner and were directed here by a local. Brophy Bros is a casual joint by the water serving delicious and fresh seafood fare. The restaurant itself has outdoor and indoor seating but is not too large and the wait can be long. We were advised that there would be a 1-1 1/2 hour wait and so we went downstairs for drinks to pass the time. Bartenders there were super friendly and the drinks (Bloody Mary and margarita) were good and very strong. We were happily surprised when our pager buzzed after only about 40 minutes.  For dinner we ordered:Peel-and-eat shrimp: good portion of cold unpeeled shrimp served with cocktail sauce. Simple but very well executed. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and incredibly fresh. Ahi: Neither one of us were originally considering this as our main entree, but both of us ended up getting this because of the enthusiastic praise from the guys at the table next to us and the servers. So glad we did! Ahi is encrusted in roasted cashews and seared. The cashew flavor is extremely mild and didn't overpower the fish at all, it just added a great crispy coating to contrast the texture of the fish. The tuna is sashimi grade and incredibly fresh and not fishy at all. Easily finished the dish. It's also served with your choice of two sides. I chose the rice pilaf which was decent and the coleslaw which was really delicious and refreshing. You also get a choice of clam chowder or salad before the ahi.As a sweets lover I was shocked to find out that they don't serve any desserts here. They stick to seafood, but they do it so well that I guess I'm ok satisfying my sweet craving elsewhere. Would like to come back here for lunch or at sunset and sit outside. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for some bomb seafood.",4 star rating,Kell S.

Hubby got the claim chowder, and fish n chips. He was blown away with the claim chowder and enjoyed the fished n chips. I had the pasta with no shrimp because I'm allergic to shrimp, and it was so light and filling at the same time. I finished the whole plate of pasta, and rarely do I ever finish my food because I drink a ton of water and fill up on bread before hand. We also had oysters appetizers and they where amazing. I dont know if it's because we had not had oysters in awhile or what but they were GREAT!

2/22/2018,"Seattle, WA","Brophy Bros. consistently popped up on my list while researching the best of SB restaurants for our family's vacation this week.  On our first night in town on Sunday, while craving some good local seafood for dinner, BB had an 1.5 hour wait so we abandoned our plan with the intent to return later during our stay.  Yesterday (Wed) for lunch we arrived a little after noon with no wait to a little 3-top out on the balcony.  The view across the harbor was GORGEOUS and immediately next to our table (for the cooler winter season, the patio is wrapped in temporary weather proofing window tarps).Food was delicious- hubby ordered a 3 piece fish 'n chips ($12.25) which had all the things you crave in a really good plate of fish 'n chips (hot, fresh, creamy-inside-crunchy-outside, fluffy light tempura-ish batter).  Since I knew I would nibble on his fish 'n chips, I got the protein rich 1/2 dozen oysters ($12.25, served with an incredible housemade cocktail sauce drizzled with nosehair burning horseradish).  To drink, hubs ordered a local IPA ($5.50, Rincon Brewery, in a can) and I got a glass of local Sauvignon Blanc ($9.75, Brander).  The little will only eat fries and there were plenty on hubby's plate to pass on over.Service was EXCELLENT! Hope had a smile on her face our entire lunch, was so sweet and understanding with the little one, gave us a local recommendation for where to try sea urchin (the fish market next door) and was an excellent server to boot (timely unobtrusive service).If I was craving seafood in SB (and why would you not???), BB will definitely hit the spot!

I would highly recommend coming early because the place isn't too big and it gets crowded pretty fast! Gotta order the clam chowder. The clam chowder is one of the best I have had in a really long time. I love how they give you tons of fresh clams. You know it's fresh clams when it's not salty but sweet instead. They also served the soup real hot and they give you unlimited baskets of bread to dip with!!!! So good and I'm always craving for more. The crab and shrimp salad was also really good. They use fresh crab meat and the avocado complements very well together.  They toss the salad with a special made dressing such was tangy cocktail blend. Goes well with the seafood..

But their clam chowder was very, very good and the kid used the table bread and butter to make do.  I ordered the shrimp salad. Nice combination of shrimp with a type of  dressing on the shrimp, not on the salad itself. Kind of like if the insides of a shrimp roll were artfully dumped on top of mixed greens and other salad stuff. Tasty. I tried really hard not to order the fried seafood plate so instead ordered a seafood pasta. It was good but not my fave. I prefer seafood pasta in a white wine/garlic sauce and this was more of an Alfredo type. Did I tell you how great the clam chowder was? That was my favorite part of the whole deal. Oh, and sitting outside watching the marina was lovely.

If you're in Santa Barbara you might as well enjoy the view at all times. It is a little difficult because they allow people to stand around the bar outside but that means they're extremely close to the outside tables. A little intrusive actually. The service was good. No complaints there. The upstairs full restaurant is not that big so you may have to wait for a table. We waited for about 25 minutes so not too bad.Some of the food was considerably better than some other food. The fish and chips were good but nothing to brag about, even though it's one of their most popular dishes. The salmon salad was really good. To me, it's a must have at this place. We also got the fried fish as an appetizer and that's a total pass. Just not worth it. This place is reasonably priced and they give you bread as an appetizer.

This is a very filling dish. You can definitely share it with 2 people (5/5)2. Swordfish - served with rice pilaf (my bf's choice) and guacamole and salsa. The swordfish tasted delicious. Definitely everything here was served fresh! (5/5)3. 1/2 Dozen Oysters - add some cocktail sauce, squeeze some lemons, slurp and yum! What more can I say? (5/5)4. Fried Calamari - fresh and scrumptious! It tastes great with the tartar sauce dip! (5/5)The entrees that we ordered came with your choice of soup or salad, rice or french fries. Unfortunately the seafood pasta doesn't come with the french fry option - only soup or salad. So I opted for the clam chowder, it was decent (but I've had better).

8/2/2018,"San Gabriel, CA","fish and chips were soo yummy!! the batter outside was crunchy and the fish inside was plump and tasty! i loved it so much! the fries were just your normal fries but it was good, wasn't soggy and def freshly made. the fish & chips came with cole slaw, tar tar sauce and marinara sauce. we also had the seafood pasta based on pictures and review suggestions, it was good, but i do enjoy my pasta a bit creamier! when it says ""seafood"" pasta it really only had shrimps & scallops, i wish it had more seafood; hence the name? lol but overall the pasta was a light creamy one, so it wasn't too heavy. big portion too! these 2 orders can fill you up! it also came with a cup of clam chowder which was super delicious! maybe i just love chowder soup but i really enjoyed this one, and happier it came with the meal :) servers were nice & friendly. they would come back to refill water without us asking & would stop by to pick up dishes and plates we weren't using to make more room since the table was pretty small. they would return frequently to ask if everything's okay. love how attentive they are! parking was pretty packed even on a Monday morning, right before noon. we paid to park and almost couldn't find parking space. seating was easy since it wasn't busy yet, but i heard it can get pretty packed and the wait is long sometimes. we sat outside so we had views of the boats and water, it can be a little bit small though but overall an enjoyable experience and would totally come back for the fish & chips! i want to try the calamari next time! :)",4 star rating,Sandy T.
8/18/2015,"Torrance, CA","The best thing you can do for yourself after a long bike ride along the beach is stop by Brophy Bros and treat yourself to a Bloody Mary and some fresh seafood. It's the perfect place to relax and get some of the most reasonably priced seafood around. The view is lovely, and the ambiance is casual and friendly.What we ordered:Cold combo: I'm sure the other one thousand or so reviews have already explained why this dish is a must order, so I won't get too much into it, but if you are a lover of ceviche and dungeness crab like I am, you will be a very happy camper!Clam Chowder: Very rich, the creamiest chowder I've ever tasted! If you glance at this chowder sideways, you will gain five pounds. Pair that fact with the bread you will inevitably be dunking, and you've got yourself some extra gym time to look forward to.Oyster Shooters with Liquor: A tasty way to get not drunk. One was enough for me, I think the liquor and condiments overshadowed the delicate Pacific oysters. Bloody Marys: You MUST order these Brophy style and extra spicy. The freshly grated horseradish made all the difference. Service was great. The servers are super friendly and on point. Price was reasonable, around $70 for two with 2 drinks a piece. If you are sitting on the patio near the bar area, beware that the bar is open to both the inside and outside. You will be very close to people who are hanging out at the outside bar, and the space between the tables and the bar is around 3 feet. A little awkward, but not unavoidable. I will definitely sit inside next time!",5 star rating,Kyung E.

I came in a day before and had ordered the swordfish, when I was served my plate I  was given the sea bass though I didn't realize it was the wrong order until the end of the meal when I saw another customer being served the correct one. I didn't eat most of my meal because I didn't like the Cajun spices. I came back the next day and let the manager though where she proceeded to ask what she could do for me and offered me a free lunch on the house. I wanted to thank them for the hospitality and to show other restaurants & businesses that is how customer service should be handled. I am now a happy customer & love the food. And will continue coming back and suggesting Brophy Bros to anyone I know!Thanks again!-Monique",5 star rating,Monique L.

If you can get outdoor seating, I highly recommend it. You get a view of fishermen bringing in their catches of the day, preparing it for local consumption. Service here is charming, personable, and impeccable. I loved that despite my waitress having her hands full, she was still super kind. I shared everything and think that may be the way to go when dining here. The clam chowder haunts me to this day. There was no skimping here, which is greatly appreciated.The flavor was just so on point. The ceviche was served on a bed of greens and blew my mind. The fish and chips was equally as palate-pleasing. I must revisit.",5 star rating,Stacey S.
9/14/2018,"Charlottesville, VA","Brophy Bros is a cool place on the water in Santa Barbara. You walk up stairs into a room with tables, a bar, and the kitchen. There is a patio that wraps around the restaurant with outdoor seating. We sat on the patio and had a great view of the neighboring marina and ocean! We ordered the swordfish and the mahi mahi. We got the side salad and the rice pilaf. The side salad comes out first and was a good starter...slightly dressed with grated cheese on top. Side note...if you want the garnishes don't order the fish blackened. Blackened means the fish comes plain with butter on the side. Or just be sure to mention you'd like the garnish. Both fish were of good size and were delicious! Both garnishes were great...the guacamole and salsa were delicious, it was a large scoop of fresh avocado and some pico de gallo. The mango and papaya relish was like a sweet salsa! We really enjoyed walking down the coast of Santa Barbara and eating at Brophy Bros!",4 star rating,Adam C.

The seafood pasta is the best thing on the menu but you can't go wrong with just about anything else.

I had the mahi mahi with a mango salsa and it had ZERO flavor. I took a few bites and dated the heck out of it thinking it would help but it didn't. My mom had the ahi tuna and it always mediocre. The crust had no flavor and while it came with a dipping sauce you had to completely submerge your piece of ahi in order for it to have any flavor.

7/15/2017,"Palmetto, FL","Great place on the Santa Barbara wharf. We got there by chance at about 15 minutes before and there was only one couple in line ahead of us. They were local and said they open promptly and they opened right at 11:00 sharp. We picked our table and got menus and drinks very quickly. The wait staff was amazing-very professional, friendly and got our orders right away-really nice since we were hungry. The room filled up almost immediately after opening with almost all tables and only a few seats at the bar open. Even with all the people, our orders came out pretty fast. We ordered two Brophy Burgers, clam chowder, clam strip plate and a steak with a salad. The Brophy Burgers were tasty and the meat juicy. The clam chowder was delicious-so thick and full of clams. The clam strip plate was with fries and coleslaw. The clams were meaty and had a good flavor-not the normal mostly breading kind. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and coleslaw was good too. The steak was the highlight though. It was cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth and the white wine, butter reduction was perfect. It came with potatoes or rice-and the rice was a wild rice pilaf that was delicious. We would definitely come back to eat here again. It is a bit loud-maybe because of the low ceilings but it is worth getting in line or whatever to give this a try.",4 star rating,Gloria L.

The wait on the weekends is pretty long but they give you a beeper with a pretty wide range and you can just walk along the beach or harbor until it's time to sit. I would HIGHLY recommend sitting outdoors because it's HOT inside. For food we ordered the clam chowder, fish and chips, and seafood pasta. The clam chowder was the bombbbbbbb. That is for sure one of the best clam chowder I've ever eaten!! The fish and chips is nice and crispy and flavorful. The seafood pasta was okay. They give you scallops and shrimp but I only got a small piece of fish in it :(. My bf didn't like the pasta much because it was bland to him.

9/24/2017,"La Jolla, CA","Came here once for dinner while on a conference and enjoyed my time so went for lunch with girlfriends during a Santa Barbara day trip. First visit felt more magical. Maybe because my colleague and I got a view of the harbor at night and were famished. Also we were lucky and were seated right away (but it was a Wednesday night around 8pm)Second visit -- ehh. Waited a little over 30 minutes on a saturday (could have been worse). The place was packed and I was surprised since we arrived at 11:35am, not too long before it opened.  We're give a handy buzzer at least so we could take a stroll around the harbor. Fish and chips -- tasty since they use a nice white flaky fish and the batter is good but during my second time, it was more batter than fish so that was disappointing because it made the flavor unbalanced. Fries were decent and crispy. Clam chowder -- there is a huge difference between the cup and bowl; just get a cup if you are ordering more than one item; my in-laws said this was the best clam chowder they've ever had. I agreed with them on my first visit then on my second visit.. it was good but didn't live up to ""best ever"". Had a good amount of meat and potato but way too much celery. My friends had the fried calamari and one of the seafood pastas. Neither were impressed with their selections. Too bad because last time, I thought their fried items were good. Note -- to eat at the restaurant, you need to go up a narrow set of stairs and check in with the hostess.   They have a bar downstairs that seems to have slightly different opening hours where they also serve the full menu.  Bathrooms are downstairs a little bit aways from the restaurant.Additionally, if you are over the wait and want something faster, then check out The Alley which is downstairs pass their bathrooms. The Alley seems to have a casual vibe and on the menu they serve the clam chowder, garlic baked clams, fish and chips, and a few other fried items from Brophys. Check them out while you wait. Was almost tempted but then our buzzer rang.",3 star rating,Alyssa P.
3/25/2015,"Concord, CA","Oh Brophy's how do I miss thee.  Brophy's is a must for any visit to Santa Barbara. Beautifully located in the Santa Barbara Harbor, this is a truly local restaurant with a variety of seafood options. Yes, it can get touristy, but most great places in the harbor are.  Not a fan of seafood? No problem, Brophy's has options for you too. The clam chowder is hands down the best one can find.  Their garlic baked clams are baked with breadcrumbs, bacon and a healthy amount of garlic are enough to keep you salivating for the next course.  Brophy's fried shrimp and fish n chips are always cooked to perfection.  They have a variety of beer on tap and a decent selection of wine.  Their Bloody Mary's are a local favorite!Recommendations:1) sit at the bar if you're a group of two or three if you can score seats.  2) if you want to avoid a long wait for a table, arrive when they open at 113) have a drink and appetizer at the window while you wait.4) try the garlic baked clams, even if it makes you squirm, they are delicious.

The cole slaw was delicious and not too creamy from too much mayo. The cocktail sauce and tartar sauce they serve is tasty as well! + Hot Combo ($17.25): 8 beer-boiled shrimp, 4 steamed clams, 2 oysters rock, 4 steamed mussels, 2 baked clams. The baked clams were SO GOOD! The oysters had a creamed spinach baked on top of it and was pretty interesting! The rest of the seafood such as the shrimp and steamed mussels didn't taste very fresh though. And the mussels were MINISCULE. The presentation of this dish was an A+, but the taste of the dish itself wasn't fantastic. + Mai Tai ($9.75): SO STRONG! Getting your bang for your buck with it.SERVICE - Our server was really friendly, but either the kitchen or her had miscommunicated the order. We waited extra long for our hot combo to come out because they brought us fried clams first. ATMOSPHERE - Essentially, the atmosphere and amazing view is what you're paying for here. With boats and yachts galore in sight, it truly is a gorgeous view! The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and has a giant bar that sprawls across the entire restaurant. It's definitely very lively and very packed!Overall, had to come for the view! The fish n chips were good, but be prepared for rather mediocre seafood quality.",4 star rating,Lillian C.
9/8/2018,"Glendale, CA","Every time I am in Santa Barbara I make sure that I make a stop here before heading back home. It is a small place and can get pretty crowded but you can get lucky and don't have to wait very long. I love places that don't have a ""corporate"" feel. This is definitely one of those spots. I always get the clam chowder and calamari. The best way to start the meal. Clam chowder with the sourdough is to die for. All the main dishes are pretty good but the ""Fish &Chips"" and ""Sea Bass"" is probably the one I usually get the most. The fish is so fresh and just melts in your mouth. My boyfriend loves the Rincon IPA that they have there as well. It is from a local brewery and it is really tasty! Even though the wait can be long sometimes, it is worth it!",5 star rating,Jessica A.

2/22/2020,"Tempe, AZ",Brophy Brothers came highly recommended and we were told that it gets quite crowded. Arrived around noon on Friday afternoon and had about a 20 minute wait. Stood at the bar and were properly served a selection of drinks. The bartenders were very engaging giving us recommendations about the menu. Once we were seated we were very crowded in to a very noisy restaurant. However the food was excellent. My dining companions enjoyed fish and chips and a blackened Seabass. My husband had the best tuna melt I think I've ever tasted. I settled on the breaded clam strips that were simply amazing. Perfectly cooked and sweet. Restaurant is noisy but I guess that is part of the ambience. However food was very good.,4 star rating,Jan D.
5/6/2018,"Alhambra, CA","I always stop by every time I'm in Santa Barbara. My favorite are the scallop plate and clam chowder. Second favorite are the fish and chips. They're delicious but I'm definitely a bigger scallop person hence my bias toward scallops. The cold plate combo is fantastic, we've gotten it a few times. Parking is in the harbor lot and either 90 mins free or the paid lot. Usually I park in the paid because the wait times are generally fairly long.Worth it though :)",5 star rating,Eva M.
6/25/2017,"Ontario, CA","The food was delicious except the Sea Bass but that'll be part of the review. We waited for an hour to be seated. While we waited we went to the bar down stairs for my husband to have a drink.My husband and I came here for his birthday and we really liked this place. We ordered the shrimp plate as an appetizer and it was delicious. If you are not a fan of strong/bitter flavor ask the server to bring the cocktail sauce without the radish in it. To our taste it was too bitter.I ordered the Sea food pasta with clam chowder and fries. I got full with the appetizer and the soup so I ended up taking the whole plate home but it was really good.My husband ordered the Sea Bass, with clam chowder. He loved the calm chowder but disliked the taste of the Sea Bass. It literally tasted all burned that it was not tasty or enjoyable at all. This is the first time we ordered the Sea Bass like this but didn't like it.I highly recommend their clam chowder is so good and filling that by the time you get your main plate you'll get a box to go. We will definitely come back to this restaurant to try different items from the menu.",4 star rating,Cristy B.

1/11/2017,"Mountain View, CA","My two friends and I came to Brophy Bros for dinner Sunday night. We strolled along the harbor to kill our hour-long wait. Near the end of our wait, we sat downstairs at the more casual, better lit Brophy Bros bar, where the waitress gave us free bread! Having had plenty of time to study the menu, it didn't take us long to put in our orders once we were seated. I chose the grilled fish sandwich, a cheaper menu item at ~$12, with a side salad instead of fries. I can see why people like Brophy Bros, as portions are large, and ingredients fresh. Every plate comes bursting with its dish, mine with a healthy pile of dark leafy greens and a thick sandwich including toasty sourdough bread. I'm not sure what fish they use but it is very meaty, such that it looks like a chicken breast or patty, but is of course more exciting than those usual options. I enjoyed the salty rich tartar sauce that came in a side tin with my meal, and smeared it inside my sandwich. The coleslaw tasted watery and simply mildly sweet, so nothing notable there. One of my friends got the crab and shrimp salad, which was lemony, interestingly spicy, and bountiful in seafood. Having said all of these positive things, I don't think Brophy Bros is really worth a whole hour's wait, with no avoiding it since they don't take reservations. I'll admit I was in a bit of a hangry state for this meal, which may bias my review, but I would generally describe this restaurant as great quality food in a nautical setting, nothing outrageously special. But if you are prepared to chill-at-the-bar type of evening and/or oceanside meanderings, you'll be satisfied!",4 star rating,Amy G.

9/9/2018,"Las Vegas, NV",This is a must when in Santa Barbara. Brophy Bros on the harbor is nothing short of an icon in these parts. The food is off the charts but it's the experience that you long for when you leave. We were seated on the deck overlooking the water after a 45 min wait which was well worth it. The clam chowder and baked clams were a perfect starter to the evening and their baked bread is excellent. I went with the fish and chips and it was just fantastic. You don't get the greasy fried ill feeling most places leave you with. My wife had the scampis and it was as good as any five star restaurant in Las Vegas. Service was friendly and on point.

4/13/2018,"San Francisco, CA","What a perfect place to grab seafood noms! My sister recommended this place after researching and my, was it packed on Friday during lunch!We only had to wait about 15 minutes rather than 30 and we were seating upstairs outside on balcony-like deck. We had an awesome view of the boats, harbor, and water. The weather was a perfect 70 degrees so I would recommend coming here on a beautiful and clear day. Some dishes we shared were the calamari and Seafood Spaghetti with the New England Clam Chowder, and fries. First off, the calamari came in hearty rings and had a nice crispy edge; the texture wasn't gummy at all. The calamari was perfectly seasoned and peppered and it came with a side of tartar and cocktail sauce. As for the Seafood Spaghetti, I was expecting red sauce but it was moreso simple with olive oil, salt and pepper seasoning, and diced tomatoes. It was lightweight without the heaviness of the usual creamy sauces. The only suggestion I would have is cutting the tomatoes smaller. For the New England Clam Chowder, it came with a side of crunchy oyster crackers. Upon first taste, it had brief taste of caramel but transitioned into the classic clam chowder we all know and love. The texture was also heavier compared to other clam chowders I've had. Unfortunately, this wasn't my favorite version but it was still A-OK. Overall, I would totally recommend coming here for lunch or an early dinner for the awesome view! Our server (I think her name was Katie) was super sweet and we also had another waitress who was very helpful in filling our waters when we couldn't find Katie. The gentleman server was also very prompt in bussing our dishes... almost to the point where I wouldn't see his hand start reaching over to clear the table until it was by the side of my face.",4 star rating,Vivian C.

10/17/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Where do I even start with Brophy Bros? Amazing? Delicious? Scenic? Life-changing? Any of those will do really.Brophy Bros is THE place to go for casual seafood in Santa Barbara. It's located right in the harbor so you get an epic view of the water and all the boats from the restaurant, plus they have tons of outdoor seating which is ideal since it's 70 and sunny basically year-round here. It can get crowded but isn't that the best sign of a good restaurant? And it's definitely worth the wait.Lastly--and most importantly--the food is incredible and totally reasonably priced. I'm a sucker for good fish and chips (laugh all you want) and these are some of the best I've ever had. The fish is so flaky, lightly battered and crispy, and their tartar sauce is perfect for dipping it in. I also tried the clam chowder (which comes in a mug with oyster crackers), the crab cakes, and some of the salmon and everything I tasted was absolutely phenomenal. If Brophy Bros isn't already on your ""MUST GO TO"" list every time you're in the area, it's about time you add it.",5 star rating,Kyle M.

We were seating outside on the beautiful patio with a view of the water and boats. Of course I ordered their famous fish and chips and it was amazing. So fresh and great service. I'd skip the drinks though, I ordered the la paloma and it was way too strong and didn't taste good at all then the waitress was kind enough to switch my drink to a regular margarita which was also horrible so I'll stick to water next time.",4 star rating,Hilary N.

10/15/2014,"Las Vegas, NV","Two Words: Hyped UpEverytime I eat at Brophys, I feel like I am dining at the seafood version of Denny's. I have been here three times. I have never had a decent service or quality food from Brophys.This time I ordered the mahi mahi with side of salad and pilaf. The salad came within a minute and I was confused - my salad looked like a soup garnished generously with lettuce. I had a few bites - it tasted like hidden valley ranch and the lettuce was very soggy.While my friend and I were waiting for our entree, the waitress quickly wiped down the table next to ours. A piece of oyster cracker flew by my feet (what am I a pigeon?). The waitress and I made awkward eye contact  and chuckled at me. My mahi mahi came out and it was bland. It was poorly seasoned and it was somewhat orange in the middle. I ordered the mahi mahi, not mystery fish. During this whole time, my friend and I felt claustrophic because every minute a waiter/waitress would power walk through the aisle. I thought one of them was going face plant onto my entree.I will definitely not go here again....unless my friend decides to have a birthday dinner here. In that case, since I am a good friend, I would tell them to celebrate elsewhere.",2 star rating,Jen B.

Both were exceptional. We enjoyed their warm baked bread and butter along with a hot press, a spicy cocktail that was perfect. Did I mention delicious seasoned French fries?!?!

The wait wasn't too bad. On a Saturday noon we waited about 15 minutes. They give you a beeper so you can walk around the shops and kill time.Parking -- valet is $6. They don't validate. Or you can drive around and try to find parking. Weekends are congested for parking so I suggest paying the $6.Food -- we didn't get cocktails so I can't comment on those but we did order the cold seafood appetizer which was fantastic. For $16, totally worth it. The salad that came with meals were fresh and huge-- try the basil vinagrette-- it's so good you'll want to put it on everything.  My bf had the clam chowder which he said was okay but not great.I ordered the blackened seabass with fries and slaw. My bf ordered the grilled salmon with cream sauce (also with fries and slaw). The salmon was a little dry but it was a large, fresh cut of fish. Just wished they'd taken it off the grill a bit sooner and perhaps cooked it in the sauce which comes in a tiny plastic cup on the side. The seabass was also a large, fresh cut of fish, but the blackened seasoning was all I could taste. It completely overpowered the fish. Neither one of us liked the slaw but the natural cut fries were good. Bottom line, for $25 per entree, we've had better meals. But you won't leave hungry-- the portions are good sized.Service-- fantastic. No complaints. Our glasses were never empty. And very friendly.Ambiance-- this is where BB loses stars. We were sat at a table for two next to the clam bar on the balcony. The view was great but they allow people to crowd the aisle between the clam bar and the tables and we literally had some guy's butt in our faces for most of our meal. Literally. He didn't have a large butt, but it was a butt nonetheless. Every time he reached into his back pocket to check his cell phone (apparently he was waiting for an important text and had to keep checking just in case he missed it), he almost knocked over our drinks. The staff had to keep saying ""excuse me"" to squeeze between him and our table. It would have been nice if one of the staff would have asked him to move or stand closer to the clam bar, but no one did. Let's just say the random butt in our faces and inches from our food did cheapen the experience a little. We almost asked him to move but we're making a concerted effort to be less confrontational these days so we tried to ignore it.It may have been better to sit inside or away from the clam bar.Note: the restaurant is upstairs and I'm not sure if there's an elevator or not. We saw a few older ladies struggling to climb the stairs. If you're stair-adverse, you may want to steer clear and pick one of the ground floor restaurants.",3 star rating,Christine C.

7/25/2016,"San Jose, CA","Pros:-Beautiful scenic seating outside. Really great view of the harbor and all the sail boats. There's a bar area that's 1/2 inside and 1/2 standing outside, as well as a dining area inside. So seat selection is definitely a plus.-Choppino: VERY FRESH. There were 2-3 clams and mussels but they were HUGE! The white fish is cooked perfectly! It's soft, tender and flaky. -Ceviche: unfortunately, I found a tiny hair in my serving. BUT this problem was solved promptly and properly. The waitress brought me a NEW bowl and comped my order. I didn't even have to ask! That's why I gave them 4 stars. The ceviche was very flavorful and fresh. It had a strong citrus flavor. I couldn't stop eating it. Service: Our waters were never empty. The server asked us how we were doing and checked on us at the appropriate time (not when our mouths were full!) lol. They also were very quick to serve us bread when we ran out. I was very impressed. Cons:-crowded: outside seating for 2 people was 15-20minute wait (although well worth it).Overall, this place is a new favorite. I can't wait to come back to try their fish and chips! They looked delish!!P.S. for those of you who play Pokemon Go, there are 3 Pokestops here. Hahah. #GottaCatchEmAll",4 star rating,Debbie Rae N.

He has already decided all celebratory events for him must include Brophy Bros' poke or it's a bust.We got there early, warned by other Yelpers that there can be quite a line to be seated. We were told to expect a 30-minute wait, so we wandered with our buzzer and headed to the gift shop next door. Not 5 minutes later, our table was ready! We were seated outside and it was an amazing view of the harbor from the 2nd floor!Everything about this place was seamless. All servers checked on their tables regularly, walked quickly, and were extremely helpful. Immediately after being seated, our waitress brought amazing, hot bread for us to share. She checked back in within a couple minutes, bringing our drinks and providing dinner suggestions.My husband ordered the 1/2 order oysters and the Ahi Poke salad, I ordered the crab cakes with fries and a cup of the clam chowder. Both were very, very good. The clam chowder was delicious, and I know next time I will order a whole bowl! The crab cakes were great (could have used a wee bit more spice, but that's my problem), and the fries tasted fresh. As I sad before, my husband was obsessed with the poke and barely let me try a piece. I know we will be back regularly for that alone!For the view, the food, and the service, this place is a steal. I can't wait to have it again!",5 star rating,Molly F.
1/6/2017,"San Diego, CA","Long wait?  Yes, but you can dine downstairs where they have part of the food menu and drinks are still available!  Portions are huge and delicious.  We tried the fish and chips (get it!! so tender on the inside yet light and crispy on the outside), clam chowder (also great), and sesame grilled salmon salad (huge piece of salmon and a looott of salad).We went on around the holidays, so they were packed, but service was still great and the food came out pretty quickly.",5 star rating,Helena Q.

3/5/2019,"Beverly Hills, CA","This is the place we chose for lunch on our little drive up to Santa Barbara. I went on yelp and found this place so we decided to try it. It was on a Saturday so it was jam packed. They gave us a buzzers remote so we decided to take a stroll downstairs around the boats. Time went by fast and they buzzed us within 20 min or so. They sat us outside and it was pretty nice. The pier in Santa Barbara is much small compared to our normal LA and OC piers. We started out with some oysters. And since my husband was driving I decided to have a glass of wine. And here is my complaint. You would think that they would have a variety of wines since they are up north, you would think they would put a little more effort into the wine menu. When I asked my server what Pinot they recommended he said ""Mark West"" oh no I thought ! Anyways the oysters were delicious. We ordered fish and chips and that also was delicious. Next time I hope they have more of a wine selection and hopefully we can get seated on the right side so you get more of a ocean view as we got more of a pier and boat view. Overall a lovely place with great seafood and not overpriced at all. It was a nice lunch.",4 star rating,Anna L.

7/23/2019,"Tustin, CA","Visiting Santa Barbara, I was referred to Brophy Bros., for the ""true Santa Barbara seafood experience.""  I was UNDERWHELMED!The place was PACKED, so they must be doing something right.  I found it to be loud, rowdy, dirty, sloppy, unfriendly with generally bad service.  However, to my surprise, the crab cakes and clam chowder were AWESOME!  Unfortunately, the oysters were VERY BAD... melted ice, served room temp, no care taken at all... Very disappointing.Maybe I caught this place on the wrong night, wrong server, wrong table, wrong crowd, wrong frame of mind.If you are with a fun group of people, have plenty of time to wait, in the mood for some hard-drinking, raucous, partying evening, and maybe a little seafood.... This could be your place.",3 star rating,Steve S.

We sat outside on the porch (heaters provided) with a great view of the marina.Our waitress (Gabby) was ultra nice and attentive, and explained all details about the dishes and options.We ordered the Bowl of New England Clam Chowder, the Beer Boiled Shrimp and the Hot Combo [Beer-Boiled Shrimp (8), Steamed Clams (4) Oysters Rock (2), Steamed Mussels (4), Baked Clams (2)].Wow, everything was very good, served hot/steaming, perfectly seasoned.Service was great, staff was happy, efficient and attentive, they made us feel valuable customers.The prices are very fair for this type of food and at a prime location, no wonder the locals enjoy it too.Recommended",5 star rating,Alexandre H.

5/10/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","As a local I don't come here as often as I'd like simply because i know they get very busy, but today I decided to check them out with my son and treat myself to a Mothers Day lunch. To my surprise the lower level part of Brophys was pretty empty and we were able to seat ourselves right away. I believe the lower level part of Brophys is more of a pit stop for drinks, lunch, and appetizers. The menu is very simple and it's not the same as the one in their restaurant above. I don't know if that means you couldn't ask to look at a full menu if you were looking to order something that's not offered on it. In any case we were happy to be seated right away, the service was good and our food came out quick! Best clam chowder in town! So believe the hype about that. We ordered the calamari which is also served with french fries and coleslaw. I'm not too fond of coleslaw but I must say it wasn't too bad. Fish and chips were delicious!",4 star rating,Angela R.

12/29/2017,"San Diego, CA","Our party of 4 visited Brophy Bros. based on the good Yelp reviews. It was fine, but not great.There are fantastic views of the marina if you sit outside or if you sit at the bar area. But most of the tables are inside without a view. As others have mentioned, the tables are very close together (both inside and outside on the balcony).It's definitely loud inside, which is fine, but just be prepared. The sad part is that all of us thought the food was just okay. Definitely pricey for above-average bar-ish food. We ordered the salmon and the sea bass and while the portions were generous, neither one wow'd us. Maybe it was super fresh, but we couldn't tell.High marks for the service! Everyone from the hostess staff to the servers were very friendly and helpful. But overall, if you're not coming to sit outside for the view, there are probably better options for seafood.",3 star rating,Scott G.

The hostess asked if we'd like to have a drink at the bar while we waited, which we did, because... I mean, c'mon, who can say no to a pre-dinner drink?!? After about 5 minutes, we were seated in the covered patio (yes there are heating lamps. We would have frozen without them). The area was cozy and comfortable with a nice view of the dock. We started out with the calamari, two oyster shooters & a cup of the clam chowder. For our entrees I had the seafood pasta and my husband had the beer battered shrimp. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious, but the star of the night was definitely the clam chowder!!",5 star rating,Tania B.

I'm glad we came in when it's ugly out because there were plenty of tables and no waiting required. Bartender seemed like he was having a great time with guests too which is awesome.

A couple of tips:  Be aware that this is a small and somewhat noisy place.  It is not a super fancy chill type spot.  The outside tables are better if you can get one and the view in unmatched.    I should also note there is also a nice long bar if you wish to just pop in, skip the wait, and have a quick beer and appetizer before you go for that walk out onto the breakwater.",5 star rating,James Y.

2/22/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was good but I think the nearby Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is much better. They are pretty pricey, we paid $22 for a plate of crab cakes, which were delicious but not the best I've ever had. I also got a hot combo plate, which came with two oysters, a few mussels, clams, etc. I normally LOVE shellfish, seafood is my favorite type of food. I could sit and eat an entire bowl of clams and mussels. The mussels here though were that great quality, they had undigested kelp or something in it, and also sticking out grossly so it was a grisly texture. The clam was better but I still sometimes chewed bits of the shell and would get an unpleasant crunch. Definitely not good for your teeth.They did serve an excellent sourdough that was really good with the clam chowder. This place is really great for the view and atmosphere but their food I expect for their price point to be a LOT better.",3 star rating,Amy K.
2/25/2016,"Houston, TX","Aside from the surprise factor of its cheap price especially in a popular SoCal town (Only $10 per entree!), Brophy Bros is seriously one of the best American seafood restaurants I have been! First off, we were unintentionally bad customers for coming in an hour before closing because of unexpected Christmas hours but the waiting staff was still super nice in accommodating for our family's unconventional Christmas dinner. Like I said before, we were surprised how cheap this place was despite being in such a beautiful waterfront property in SoCal, and the food was also stellar! My choice of beer-battered fried shrimps were really on-point! Even though it was the chef's last batch before they were dismissed for Christmas, the shrimps were still fried to perfection with the beer batter added a crunch without the greasy feeling. Definitely one of the best fried shrimps I had!Really, Brophy Bros is flawless to me! I highly recommend making this your first meal choice in Santa Barbara for its excellent food, stellar service, and cheap pricing on top of a great harborside view!---tl;dr version:1) Awesome seafood restaurant by SB Harbor2) Excellent service even at the closing hours3) Delicious seafood at surprisingly Texas-level pricing",5 star rating,Jay Y.

The oysters were blue points from Rhode Island but you'd be hard pressed to find better blue points anywhere on the east coast. Fish and chips were perfectly cooked, the crust had a tempura style which could not have been tastier. Clam chowder - OMG good! Reasonable pricing for outstanding food in a beautiful setting and warm welcome. We are based in LA but will be back every time we are in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Jim A.

To my surprise, the food was well below-average. My cup of clam chowder was good as usual, but the fish and chips tasted as if they'd been under the warmer the entire morning. I was also very annoyed when my beer-broiled shrimp came out and I had to peel and devein each individual shrimp. I remember the food being so much better than it was.",3 star rating,Jillian F.
2/19/2016,"New York, NY","I came here on a day trip to Santa Barbara with my boyfriend. The location is great, right on the marina, and if you're lucky enough to get an outside table the view's very nice. We ended up sitting inside though, because we were both hungry and that was first available. Before we sat down, we ordered drinks at the bar. I had a dark and stormy, which was mainly rum and ginger beer and was delicious, and my boyfriend got a Bloody Mary which he thought was great although it was too peppery for me. You can eat at the bar if you don't want to wait for a table, which is a nice option. Once we got our table, we ordered ceviche to start followed by a tuna poke salad for me and cioppino for him. The ceviche was good, with a nice flavor and lots of fish, and the cioppino also did not skimp on the seafood and had a wonderful rich soup base. My tuna poke salad was okay; the tuna was good quality but otherwise it was pretty boring. If we come back here I'll order a proper fish dish instead of just a salad. The place was very busy but the service was good. The bathrooms are kind of a pain to get to, you have to go outside and downstairs for them and they're not the cleanest. Other than that and the boring tuna salad I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good seafood place in Santa Barbara near the beach.",4 star rating,Sarah H.

12/17/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I work at a hotel nearby and we ALWAYS recommend Brophy Bros to all of our guests. Naturally, I craved clam chowder so I went to Brophys myself because you know, I recommend it all the time. Had to sit downstairs because there was a 2 hour wait for the top restaurant. No worries. Now, my girlfriend and I sat at one of the tables by the bar for about 15 minutes without anyone saying a word to us. Since I was starving I got up and ordered from the bar. Bartender took my order. My clam chowder came in pretty past, 5-8 mins. It was luke warm at best. And the portion was minuscule. I probably ate the whole thing in 4-5 spoonfuls. My girlfriend ordered a burger. After about 25 minutes of waiting, i asked the bartender about our order, he said he would look into it and returned to watching the baseball game and polishing his glassware. Some other bartender/bar back called what i assume was the kitchen. It took more than 40 MINUTES to get that burger!!! I know it was a busy night but people who had ordered after us got their food within 15 minutes (including burgers). I was about to go cook the burger myself, it probably would've been faster. Anyways, this place is super overhyped. Clam chowder was good, not amazing. Super packed. Tourist prices for the food. Okay service. 1 star at best with my experience. Not going back.",1 star rating,Francisco H.

7/15/2016,"Hoboken, NJ","really awesome and it's right in the harbor.   I came at night when there were some fishing boats loading up their load into the trucks (truck loads of sea urchin / uni - pretty cool) and we did not have to wait for a table at all. I loved the vibe of this place; maybe it's because everyone was on vacation and seemed really laid back, but I appreciated it.  The staff was still on point with service despite the relaxed feel.  We got steamed clams, Seafood pasta, and grilled fish of our choice (sea bass; we could have chosen a different preparation blackened, steamed, etc).   I loved that each entrée came with a choice of salad or chowder - people are CRAZY to order the salad.  Pick the chowder - it's really good; nice and creamy with lots of clams.  Basically some clam in every spoonful in addition to the other goodies like potatoes.  All the food we got was awesome and sizable portions.  I couldn't finish my seafood pasta because I was so full from the steamed clams, bread, and chowder.   Such a great (not so hidden) gem, but there's a reason it's frequented! My only one complaint is that their oysters were Blue Points from the East Coast - like why couldn't they have any from the west coast.  A small fail, but I will choose to overlook.",5 star rating,Christine A.

The fish came out piping hot with just the right amount of batter and plenty of flakey white fish inside. The fish was served with crispy, freshly prepared fries, slaw, cocktail sauce and tartar sauce.  All washed down with a bottle of Firestone 805 (No draught beer).  The food was all fresh, delicious and reasonably priced.

Good seafood on the water at reasonable prices and friendly service.My sister and I had their steamed mussels and clams to start (you can order 50/50 on the clams and mussels in one order!). It was a decent service with lots of garlic and lemon. The clams really stood out since they were sweet and fresh. Then we shared a bowl of clam chowder and fish and chips platter. When the waitress said the bowl of chowder is entree size, I snorted--but she was right. It is a very generous serving and with the sourdough bread, it is a full meal. The fish and chips and three nicely fried pieces, good size servings of fries and slaw.One of the highlights was the service. With their popularity and location, you would imagine the service was slip but not so. Everyone from the hostess to the bus boys were friendly, prompt and attentive.

9/7/2016,"Newport Beach, CA","Food was alright and nothing too special. We came in ravenous after a long weekend and ordered the baked garlic clams, fried clam strips, clam chowder, and fish & chips just between 2 people. I honestly couldn't have told the difference between this restaurant and the smaller vendors at fish markets I've been to. It all tastes the same. I guess the most unique item we ordered would have been the baked garlic clams but that too tasted mediocre. The breading on the clams tasted stale that day. We have had many friends recommend that dish so maybe they were just having an off day. If you're craving seafood, this place would be an above average spot but don't expect anything mindblowingly good.By the way, they also have a self-seating area downstairs that might be a good option if you have a smaller party. I recommend ordering even when you're still standing because our food took 40 minutes to come out and by that time, you will most likely find a seat.",3 star rating,Kendra C.

We also ordered the dozen raw oyster, they were nice and sweet no gritty taste.Dungeness Crab Platter $13.25 (was my fave thing, so much crab meat for such little price.

If the weather is warm, I recommend getting outside sitting because you get a wonderful view of the boats and the dock. For food, we ordered the cold seafood appetizer and seafood pasta. Both were delicious and the portions were very generous. If you are planning on getting one of the appetizers, I recommend ordering the cold seafood appetizer instead because for a few more dollars you get more seafood and you get to try little bits of everything. The entrees come with either clam chowder soup or salad, coleslaw, and rice pilaf or fries. We ordered the clam chowder and it was delicious! The waitress forgot our coleslaw and rice pilaf, but we didn't ask for it either because it was so much food that by the time we got our pasta, we were already pretty full. We also told our waitress that we were celebrating a bday so she comped one of our Bloody Mary's. There was nothing special about the Bloody Mary's, it was pretty pricey for what it was, which was the drink with a celery. But overall the experience was close to perfect.",5 star rating,Eunice L.

Bread was great - salad as tasty.  But the calamari was the star - talk about tender and perfectly breaded (light), flavored (just enough!) and fried (not greasy) - this was the best calamari that I have had - maybe ever. Now, warning, its the rings, but it was SO good. Chick friend had fish and chips - great white fish. This place always satisfies.

I normally don't eat fried foods but even i must say this is worth trying. I've tried fish and chips from Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in vegas,  which was supposedly one of their most highly recommended choices, but honestly it was dry and bland in comparison to the fish and chips at brothys.  The only thing is that the fish and chips don't come with chips, they give you fries instead.

Most people sit at the bar facing the harbor chowing down on oysters and drinks, which is what I recommend. If not, the wait times can be ridiculously long. Their clam chowder is standard, but not the best. I do concede that their 1/2 dozen oysters are a must. We gave the hot combo appetizers a try, which included: 8 beer-boiled shrimp, 4 steamed clams, 4 steamed mussels, and 2 baked clams. Aside from the baked clams, I wasn't impressed.

8/8/2015,"Santa Monica, CA","If you are in Santa Barbara you have to come to Brophy Brothers! The clam chowder is literally the best I have had anywhere. It is hearty and packed with so many different flavors. It is simple but oh so good. The view in the marina is an added plus too. If you are looking to have a nice, long meal I would sit in the upstairs area. It can take a little bit longer though and the wait is a pain. If you are only looking to have a cup or bowl of the clam chowder, the downstairs area is much faster and is just as good. They send the food down from the kitchen using a nifty elevator. It's fun to watch and most of the locals are the only ones who know about the downstairs area. I highly recommend the food here, especially if you are in town with family. It will not disappoint.",5 star rating,Lily K.

We'd highly recommend this restaurant when in Santa Barbara.

We shared fried calamari as an appetizer...fresh and not chewy.",5 star rating,Renee R.
11/10/2017,"Pasadena, CA","Waited 30 mins for a Friday night around 7:45pm. Ordered the blue point oysters. My favorite. They were so fresh. I also got the salmon with rice and it comes with a spinach shrimp sauce. One of the best tasting sauces I've had. Actually pairs well with the seafood pasta that I also ordered. The entrees come with your choice of salad or clam chowder, and rice or fries. I ordered the salad because the clam Chowder has bacon in it. The salad was okay. It's missing a fresh element so I asked for some lemon on the side and it made the salad a little bit better. Service was good. Overall I would def come back.",5 star rating,Dawla A.

2/7/2016,"Rosemead, CA","Brophy Bros. serves some great seafood with a great view.  I actually came for dinner and it was unfortunately too dark to see too much outside, but it's location along the docks would be great in the daytime.It's not too large, and we were told that there'd be a 1-1.5 hour wait.  However, there was a downstairs bar where we could drink at while we waited, and were seated in just 40 minutes.The bloody mary at the bar was spicy and strong and very good.  I asked for it with ghost chili infused vodka, which they filled to nearly 2/3rds of the glass, and it had 2 generous scoops of horseradish to add to the kick.  As for the food:Peel and Eat Shrimp - Fresh and bursting with flavor!  A very simple dish of cold unpeeled shrimp and cocktail sauce, but the quality of the seafood made it an excellent appetizer.Clam Chowder - Very meaty with lots of hunks of clam.  Hearty, savory, and creamy, it made a good contrast to the cold, refreshing shrimp.Ahi - Various patrons and the staff all recommended this dish, and it was definitely the right choice.  It's very lightly breaded with cashews, although the nutty flavor doesn't overpower the fish at all.  Raw on the inside and lightly seared, it had a great firm texture, extremely fresh flavor, and went well with the buttery tarragon sauce.  Overall a really surprisingly good dish.  Also came with a tasty cole slaw and an okay rice pilaf.  I can wholeheartedly recommend Brophy Bros. for a delicious, casual seafood experience.",4 star rating,Tadashi N.

It's entertaining to actually say ""bros"" instead of ""brothers"". Keep that in mind. Anyhow. I got the hot combo. It came with a bowl of clams, mussels, and shrimps in a more or less flavorless broth and they were all very fresh-tasting. I think it could have done without the shrimp, though. Then outside of the bowl were two stuffed clams and two oyster rockefellers. The cocktail sauce tasted house-made, which was a bonus. Everything was very good.The bread was also incredible. It wasn't delicious enough to get me to come back, since I live out of town and there are so many more places between here and there, but it was definitely satisfying. Also: crazy crowded.

Shrimp was slightly rubbery but the sauce that came with it tasted so good. The rice and coleslaw that my friend picked to go with the shrimp weren't bad at all. The ahi poke salad was awesome. The fish was fresh and tasted so good. The service was quick. Staff were very friendly. We didn't have to wait long before we got  seated. In fact, we got seated as soon as we came in. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that the space between tables are so tight. I'm guessing they had to squeeze more tables in to accommodate more ppl.

My husband got the cold combo, he really enjoyed the crab and the oysters but the ceviche he said he could pass on but it was decent. We also got an order of the crab cakes and they were good not the best I've ever had but good. I was really expecting their clam chowder and their bread to be amazing because a lot of people were raving about it. The chowder was okay. It was good and fresh but I felt like it was a bunch of potatoes and fresh clams. There was no celery and other seasoning except for some salt and pepper. It was just okay. Maybe because we stopped by 30mins before closing so whatever was left was the bottom of the pot? I don't know it just wasn't epic and the sourdough wasn't hot and crust. It was cold and sandwich bread like. I hoped it would be better. Next time I'll probably try another place's chowder.",3 star rating,Fatima K.
5/14/2015,"Arcadia, CA","Been to Brophy Bros twice and it has always been my favorite restaurant at sb. Wait is usually 30 to an hour long but trust me it's totally worth it. This local restaurant is located right next to the harbor, sit outside during daytime and you'll get a pretty nice view (; Now with the food :D For appetizers, we always get their half dozen oysters (must-try), Dungeness crab platter and cold combo. Not to mention their cold combo is amazing; it comes with 3 oz crab meat, 3/4 cup ceviche, 2 oysters, 2 claims, and 8 peeled shrimps. Also, don't forget to try their oyster shooter cause you'll be amazed with the aftertaste! Clam chowder is a bit too salty for me. Scampi comes with jumbo shrimp sautéed with white wine, lemon and garlic. Seafood pasta is by far my favorite dish; it comes with shrimp and sea scallops. Everything was served promptly and freshly! Only downside is their dining room being too packed. I hate how there is not enough space within tables and you literally feel like you're eating with people around you. Speaking of which, theres this random couple standing right in the walkway chatting with their friends whatsoever. People were sidling in and out and sometimes even leaning on my sister's back. Servers could've done better by at least talking to them instead of ignoring the fact that they were blocking the way and that they were actually pretty annoying. Besides that, service was attentive and welcoming. Altogether it's about $100 for our meal since we came on mother's day and decided to try a little bit of everything. Always here for the oysters and pasta! Highly recommended :)",4 star rating,Alethea C.

6/3/2013,"Irvine, CA","All you need to know in one sentence: Order the Bloody Mary and the clam chowder.Those are THE highlights of my experience at Brophy's when my friend took me on my SB visit. The Bloody Mary is one strong but delicious drink, with that horseradish just kicking the taste buds in the right spot. As for the chowder, each spoonful was just as good as the one before, for it wasn't overly creamy or heavy with a good amount of clams in the actual soup. So good my boyfriend and I ended up getting another cup when we already finished our first bowl... (it's just that good).We also ordered the Ahi and half a dozen oysters - both were fresh and good too, but just did not stand out like the cocktail and chowder did.Service is relatively quick for such a busy location, but if you just want the Bloody Mary and Chowder, visit the bar downstairs as they serve it as well.",5 star rating,Tiffany Y.
10/24/2018,"Corona, CA","The restaurant was a recommendation from a friend who went to school in the area. When we got to the restaurant we noticed that it had a great view, but it was very crowded. To sit outside it was a 30 min wait (mind you it is about 2 in the afternoon on a Sunday) and they had one table for 2 left close to the kitchen. I was nervous I might get hid by the swinging kitchen door but the workers were mindful to watch out for us and the nearby tables. I found out from Yelp that the bar is open to anyone with no wait. As we began to look at the menu, the first thing that popped out to me was the crab cakes (special). Obviously, I ordered that and then the ceviche because it was hot outside; needed something to cool us down! My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips for himself. The ceviche came out first with crackers! Not chips, which I thought was so weird but it worked! the ceviche was delicious and it totally caught me off guard because it isn't a Mexican restaurant however I thought since we are close to the ocean that it had to be good! When my crab cakes came out, I was shocked! It came with only two, sauce, a salad, and a side order of clam chowder in a cup. I thought the crab cakes were not enough but once I took a bite of it, it was filled with crab meat! It was delicious and probably the best I've ever had. The sauce on the side is money! You need to try it with your order of fries too. The salad, I didn't care for it so I passed it up. The fish and chips were good as well. Not the best we've had but the fish was still really good. The batter was light and crunchy. My boyfriend and I came to the agreement that the best dish we had that visit were the crab cakes, hands down. We can't wait to come back with our friends who had recommended the place to us as we make our way up the coast again.",4 star rating,Alyssa M.
8/28/2017,"Garden Grove, CA","For the life of me, I couldn't remember what this was supposed to be. I thought it was a smoothie place for some reason. Nope, seafood.I got the seafood pasta. It was sort of bland, really oily. It wasn't ""bad"" but it was definitely a disappointment. Especially considering it was a favorite menu item or some such BS.And that was after having to wait for a table for about an hour. Yes, on a weekday afternoon this place was so jam packed with people there wasn't even an easy table for two.My wife got food too. No one cares about that.Another mark against this place is the bathrooms are located outside and downstairs. That seems very inconvenient. I suppose I could always just try peeing over the railing and maybe arcing it into a urinal, but I really don't want to go to jail for that a second time.",3 star rating,Tim O.

I wish they had more restaurants like Brophy Bros and SB Shellfish Company in the South Bay...Tried coming here once, but the line was so long we ate/drank at the downstairs bar area which was first come first serve. We only ordered the clam chowder that time, which was AMAZING. The day after we were lucky enough to score a table outside. Ordered:x Crab Cakes (Chilean snow crab, breaded, pan-seared and served with a roasted red bell pepper aioli) - 95% crab. This was super delicious! Probably one of the better crab cakes I've had. Highly recommend this.x Seabass (Dusted in Cajun spices, pan-blackened in a red hot skillet and served with drawn butter) - LOVE LOVE LOVE. The seabass was a little overcooked, but the cajun spices made up for it. Amazing flavors. I didn't care to much for the sides (fries or rice), but the fish itself was nom.x Garlic Baked Clams - I was a little upset when these came out because no where on the menu did it say it contained bacon, but it did :( Fortunately, I did not bite into any. My friends loved this.x Cioppino (Fish Stew, Topped w/ Parmesan) - Cioppino has to be one of my favorite dishes of all time, and this one was a little disappointing. The seafood was abundant and fresh, but the sauce was a little bland.x Half dozen oyster - Fresh as can be.We also ordered either the clams or mussels, but I can't seem to remember which... the broth was a little bland, but add some tobasco and it'll do the trick.All in all, really enjoyed our meal. There's nothing unique about this place other than the location, but the food is nom and the seafood is fresh. No complaints.P.S.

3/14/2015,"Diamondhead, MS","It was our first visit here and it was a great sunny breezy day on the harbor. We drove around for about twenty minutes looking for a parking space. With all the places in one area it was a challenge finding a parking spot.From reading most of the reviews on the different items on the menu, we decided to stay away from any fish since alot of people said they are usually dry or over cooked.We ordered the calamari as our appetizer and it was delicious. You know how most of the time when you get these you can tell if they were frozen or not and are usually chewy. Well these were very tender and not chewy at all. It came with an awesome cocktail and tarter sauce. The cocktail sauce had just the right amount of horseradish in it. The tarter sauce was creamy and could have needed a bit more relish in it. With a squeeze of lemon and a dip in your choice of cocktail or tarter you wont be disappointed.For my entree i ordered the breaded bay scallops which came with a side of fries and cole slaw. The scallops were nice and tender also just like the calamari. The cole slaw was very good also which added a nice crunch.Wife ordered the seafood pasta without shrimp since she is allergic to certain types of shellfish. She loved the pasta because it was cooked al dente. She did have some issues with the over cooked and chewy scallops. She also would have like more sauce on her pasta. The portion was large served in a small bowl.I think the next time we stop by i would try the fish and chips since alot of other yelpers said it was good",4 star rating,Usalinh P.

1/3/2016,"San Francisco, CA","Crowded and bustling with tourists but had a nice meal seated outside with only 20 minutes wait time around 1 pm. The wait usually goes for longer. I found out the clam chowder had bacon in it so I stopped after a bite, but the soup was tasty. The salad was tossed in some type of cream dressing so I would opt for dressing on the side or ask them to switch out to a vinaigrette next time. The half dozen oysters from Long Island were sadly a miss - they were large but very tasteless even with tons of lemon juice and globs of tomato sauce. It's confusing as to why they didn't offer more local/Pacific coast oysters instead. The grilled fish sandwich was decent, big piece of fish with lettuce and tomato. It's definitely an experience location for me - walking on the pier, enjoying local seafood restaurants and taking part of the atmosphere.",4 star rating,Karen H.
10/13/2018,"West Covina, CA",Came from out of town to find some good seafood. Checked in with the host she gave us a buzzer and it never rang.

We were told 30 minutes max.,1 star rating,Jasmine H.
2/24/2013,"Riverside, CA","Meh.  Too many things here are just ok, too many to be offset by the extraordinary service.We waited 1.5 hours for a table, which is a testament to the popularity of Brophy.  The view is spectacular, and the location is as charming as any waterfront pier can be.The WORST: Calamari is so bad I wanted to send it back. It might as well have been frozen onion rings. And the portion was barely enough to cover the bottom of a bowl. The OK: All the seafood, starting with the selections--way too few items on a small menu. What, too far from the water to bring in fresh fish?   First we had oysters, they had to be blue point because that's all they had. Fresh but not remarkable. Tasted cold.  My guests had seafood pasta, $19.  The amount of seafood in the dish was ok, but it looked like spaghetti with things just put on top as an afterthought. I had Mahi Mahi, one of the few fish dishes. It was just ok, mostly flavorless.  Best: Clam chowder. I thought it was ok, but my guests went on and on about how good it was. Their opinion counts!  GREAT: The service was one of the most responsive and attentive experiences I have ever had.  We will go back, but only for the (less expensive) lunch menu and only when it's not crowded.  And only if we have to. The restaurants downtown and the dining nightlife in Santa Barbara rival any SoCal town.  That's where we will go next time.UPDATE: Just a note to say the owner or manager contacted me privately, and he was very gracious. Both he and the staff have great customer service skills.",3 star rating,Robert P.

Plus the portions were big and the prices were reasonable. The servers were fast and attentive. Try to get a seat outside. They have the heaters so it's not too cold.

11/16/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Really cute restaurant with spectacular views from about 60% of the tables, including outside deck seating. Very hustle and bustle during the busy hours, be sure to give yourself an extra 20-40 minutes to wait for a table if you're coming at peak times.Upside to this is you can wander the jetty and harbor area, check out boats, sea life or head downstairs for a drink while you wait.The bar makes fantastic cocktails and the view looks out over the harbor. Food is good, seafood obviously being their specialty, from oysters and ceviche to the grilled and fried selections.Price is in the mid-to-high range, but fairly standard for this area and I believe the value is better than at some of the other waterfront restaurants.All in all a fun place to go if you are visiting or even if you live here! My wife and I love to slip up here and have a quick date.",4 star rating,Behr P.
7/8/2013,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA","A solid place to get a good cup of clam chowda and some seafood. Shrimp Scampi had a good flavor. I could taste the wine and it wasn't overpowered with butter. Swordfish was a bit dry, but still good. The rice, swordfish, salsa and guac made for a good combo. The service is extremely fast. You will see the busboy sweep your plates off your table as soon as it seems like you are done. There is a small lot with free parking for 90 minutes but your best bet is to stick to paying 2 bucks for each hour in the paid parking lot (both lots are in front of the restaurant area). The restaurant is also on the upper level. Not sure if that is obvious to others, but my gf had to direct me upstairs as I was totally lost trying to find it.",4 star rating,Jeffrey J.

Followed by the must-try clam chowder. Add some black pepper and Tabasco sauce, perfect combination.I usually get some sort of blackened fish but this evening went with the scampi instead. Great sauce, shrimp ever slightly over-cooked (I like mine almost sushi style), delicious pilaf. Wife had the sword fish and that was cooked to perfection (man, how I despise over-cooked seafood).I think our family have had almost everything on the menu: delicious fish and chips, plain butter pasta (for when the kids were little), ceviche, cioppino, salmon, sea bass, crab cakes.

9/2/2019,"Sacramento, CA","This place was incredible! Bar seating was first come first serve so even though there was an hour and forty minute wait for table seating, we were able to walk in and go straight to sitting at the bar. We ordered the clam chowder, fish and chips and calamari. The calamari appetizer was $11.25, which was just calamari, but if you got the calamari entree for $11.50, you got coleslaw and French fries with it! I was amazed! So much more food for only 25 cents! The clam chowder was one of the best I've had, and I've been to fisherman's wharf and other good chowder places). The fish and chips were my favorite though! The fish was so succulent and crispy on the outside. I've had Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips in Vegas and I feel like the fish and chips at Brophy Bro's rival those! I didn't care for the calamari as much, but my boyfriend liked it for the breading. The breading was buttermilk which is pretty unique for calamari! The service was fast and friendly. I would definitely come back here (I'm drooling thinking about the fish and chips and chowder)!",5 star rating,Bethany H.

The chowder was good! Nice portion of real clams, veggies and soup ratio. The crab cakes were made from real crabs. Funny to say this out loud but you know you've been to other places and the crab was ""krab"" and not the real stuff. Nice portion of meat mixed with red peppers and parsley. Not a whole lot of breading or fillers to add weight or size to the patty. It was tasty. Wait staff was professional, friendly and worked as a team to refill drinks and clear tables. Only 4 stars because our server short changed me. I paid in cash and didn't receive the exact change back. Therefore, I took it off her tip.",4 star rating,Anita C.

We also got the cold appetizer platter, which was not anything special... The lady sitting behind us complained about the taste of the clam, but I did not try it. Wish there was something to go with the ceviche since it was salty. Service was okay. Although the restaurant wasn't packed, the waitress seemed very distant. If you wanna try the clam chowder, I suggest you go a little before 11 when it opens - you'll be one of the first few that waits before the restaurant opens. Wait was 1.5 hours at night... yikes!Long story short, I would go back just for the clam chowder.",4 star rating,Kasumi B.

My date had the salmon, which he said was perfect too. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very energetic and accommodating. You can always tell when someone enjoys their work.

9/10/2017,"San Diego, CA","Drove into Santa Barbara pretty late and had no idea what to get. Came across this place and it was such a great decision! The place is very casual and laid back, we were told it would take about 30-45 mins to seat us but we got seated within 10 mins. Major plus!We were really hungry and asked to be placed in the first available table. So, we were placed inside. It was very packed and loud so it was hard to get a good conversation going, but the view at night was great. If you're looking for a more intimate dinner then I recommend trying to get a table outside. It looks like the wait time can be fairly long, so I also recommend getting there as early as possible for your meal. I ended up getting the seafood pasta. The pasta was great and light and complimented the fresh seafood very well. Overall, thoroughly enjoyed my experience.",4 star rating,Lianne L.

4/5/2017,"Woodinville, WA","Arrived on a Thursday evening and the place was packed! I got really lucky to see an opening at the bar so I sat myself there. The barman gave me water, bread and a menu as soon as I sat down. I looked through the menu and decided on the clam chowder (given the reviews being so awesome), and the fish & chips. My clam chowder appetizer arrived in just a few minutes (I didn't even see the barman place my order, it was like magic!). The chowder really was fantastic, piping hot, and full of ingredients, so I was glad I only opted for the cup size. Then my fish & chips arrived. The portion size was HUGE!! 2 fresh pieces of battered fish, served with coleslaw. During my meal I was able to watch the barman shuck oysters, while adoring the wonderful harbor view also. My water glass was consistently filled too. It was definitely noisy, but it was completely full, so it didn't bother me at all. The food and service were really great, so maybe I got really lucky, but I feel it deserved the 5 stars!",5 star rating,Anne M.
6/3/2015,"Morgan Hill, CA","My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. We waited about 10mins before being seated inside. The hostess told us that the lunch rush is usually from 1-2pm so, if possible, try your best to avoid coming during this time frame.I ordered the cold combo ($15.95), fried calamari appetizer ($8.50), and a cup of the clam chowder ($4.75). The prices are pretty steep and the portions are barely enough to share between two for a light meal. The cold combo came with a scoop of ceviche, two oysters, two clams, some crab meat, and 8pcs of shrimp. This plate was very good and my favorite of what we ordered. It's a pretty good deal; the portion size is decent, everything is fresh, and there's a nice variety. The calamari and clam chowder were good but nothing out-of-the-ordinary. The cup of clam chowder comes in an actual coffee cup, so to split between two this was not enough. I would recommend just paying a little extra to get the bowl. Order these if you're craving them, otherwise I would recommend trying their specialty menu items. Service was slow since it was fairly busy, but decent overall. The view from the outside seating is very nice as it overlooks the harbor. The inside seating area is crowded. This would be a nice restaurant to bring a friend, parent, or spouse to for lunch on a special occasion and make sure you get a table outside.All-in-all, from all the good things I've heard about this restaurant I was not particularly impressed. It was good and worth a try but I most likely won't return. I prefer to buy some fresh seafood from the fish market at the harbor and prepare it myself at home.",3 star rating,Jessica N.

3/30/2019,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA","Just had lunch there (3-30-19) with some out of state friends (5) who all wanted to eat at Brophy Brothers.  We all love Brophy Brothers, this time not so much.  We started off with 3 trays of Oysters and 2 bowls of Clam Chowder...they were both excellent. However, for the main course my friend and I ordered the Fish and Chips and that's when it all went downhill fast.  When Fish and Chips arrived they were obviously undercooked and greasy.  I could see the grease glistening on the soggy undercooked breading. Am I supposed to enjoy this?  The color of the breading was very light brown, almost vanilla in color.  Our table was near the kitchen and I could see the food coming out.  I could see from my table that the a lot of the fish on the Fish and Chips were undercooked.  The fry cook in the back was rushing out tickets too fast! Plus, his fryer grease temp was not high enough from doing too many pieces at once.  The pretty blonde lady with the pony tail and turquoise jewelry, whom I believe was the manager and working the pass, was just letting it go to the customers. She couldn't see what was happening?   She was not concerned whatsoever that the customers were getting soggy greasy breaded fish. It was disgusting!  Customers really don't want to complain, but are we supposed to eat food that we know isn't prepared properly?   I sent one piece back which was just a greasy soggy mess.  All my pieces were undercooked and I just didn't want the trouble of sending back the whole plate.  When the piece returned it was greasy and burnt.  Really???   My friend's Fish and Chips were just as bad as mine and we talked about how terrible our meal was.  I'm not going to stop going to Brophy Brothers, but someone should tell the pretty lady with the pony tail to do her job.  She is the last line of defense before a customer gets a below standard plate of food.  Your job is quality control and that means keeping high standards at the risk of being not so nice.  If you're not going to check the food and call out the chef for sub par cooking practices, who is? If you can't recognize there's a problem then that's a problem unto itself.  I didn't eat the fish it was just too disgusting.  I asked for a box and I'll feed the fish to my dogs with their dinner.  They're not so particular about what they eat.  I did pay for the meal although I was pissed off all the way home from the feeling of being cheated. That's some expensive dog food.",2 star rating,Tim B.

They let you stand at the window on the patio and order drinks, and even food. Bar prices are not outrageous like you would expect for a place on the beach. The bread they serve is local sourdough, the yummiest thing to dip into the broth that comes with the steamed mussels. You get a whole mug full of it along side.

1/3/2016,"Edmond, OK","Stopped by for lunch on Sunday. The wait wasn't too bad. Waitress very prompt and friendly. No DR Pepper, hubby sad. Nice selection of seafood. Had read chowder was gr8 and we were not disappointed. Lots of clams and not just waved around in it. Wasn't milky either. I had the shrimp and crab salad, again great. Loved the 2 types of dressing and a LOT of avocado. Hubby had fish and chips, he said they were very good. So would We go back? Oh yeah. We thought the pricing was good and portions right.",4 star rating,Robin N.

2/24/2017,"San Diego, CA","We were told about this places located right on the wharf. It is a small place upstairs right on the wharf. We had dinner there one night. I had sword fish and my wife had shrimp. Plus, we ordered a small clam chowder.  It was all very good. We enjoyed it so much we went again to have a large bowl of clam chowder. The dinners are average for fish. cost about 28-35 dollars. Do not get upset about the parking. A hint is, once you enter off of Harbor Way, park on your left. You can walk to Brophy's which is around the building. Just ask anyone.  If the weather is good, seat out on the balcony. Nice few of the boats in the bay. Look to send about $70.00 for two dinners and one drink each with tip. Well worth going even if you just have a large bowl of clam chowder which is under $8.00.",4 star rating,A G.

Their tartar sauce is so good, my husband joked about eating it in the spoonfuls! It's such a tasty, well-thought recipe, that goes well with everything! I hate sweet tartar sauces, and this is definitely not sweet.... Just rich and has a nice kick! The environment is really chill and laid-back, where you feel like a regular even though you're from The Valley.... Representin' the 818!! Anyone who is local or visiting Santa Barbara must try this place, once! I can guarantee you will be back!!

6/30/2015,"Westminster, CA","Mixed feelings but was saved by the stiff drinks and a delightful convo with one of the bartenders' mom! My bf on a whim kidnapped me to SB and after a day of hiking and beaching we were famished. I yelped and Brophy answered. We got a pager for a table which apparently was a dud bc the hostess told us she paged us 20 minutes ago. Really? Bc we had an open tab at the bar for a good 45 minutes! Oh well it happens. It was a packed house so we kept cool and kept at a drinkin til our new pager went off.In the meantime the cutest elderly couple pulled up aside from us and the wife told me how this place was awesome except for the fact that they don't stock up on her beloved 0 calorie tonic! She then proceeded to pull out her own Diet Shwepps out of her purse and mocked the bartender with it! Turns out he was her son.When we were seated we ordered half dozen oysters and calamari. OMG THE BEST OYSTERS I've ever had! So creamy and not at all oceany/briny! The seafood pasta was perfect. Noodles were the right degree of al dente and the shrimp and scallops were pump, tender and juicy. I don't even know what my date ordered bc I was too caught up with my plate! But I'm pretty sure it was amazing. I took off a star just because of the pager/wait mix up but otherwise this was a great date experience.",4 star rating,Elle P.

8/9/2018,"Hesperia, CA","We decided to have dinner here based on a 4 star rating of over 2000 reviews... Not sure what the big deal is with this place. I had the mahi mahi with mango and papaya relish. The rice was hard, the fish was undercooked and the coleslaw was nothing to brag about. Popeye's chicken and Chik-fil-a have better coleslaw than this place without the hefty price. My husband had the salmon with shrimp sauce and felt the same way I did about his plate: undercooked fish, hard rice and bland coleslaw. In order to make my fish edible I had to add salt, pepper, malt vinegar and lemon juice. The one star goes to the view which I did enjoy but I would not recommend this place and I would never go back.",1 star rating,Carolyn S.
5/25/2019,"Newport Beach, CA",I come here often and I'm very disappointed in my recent visit. I brought my service dog to the downstairs outside bar and was told by one of the BARTENDERS that I would have to leave while I was mouth full of ceviche because my dog barked a couple times at other dogs that was barking at him. I offered to show papers but he did not accept. Brophys it's illegal to deny a service animal.,1 star rating,Jamie M.
9/26/2014,"San Diego, CA","We arrived to SB in the late afternoon and we were looking for a light lunch. Brophy Bros was our choice and was only a half a mile from our hotel. We strolled from West Beach and it was only a 10 min walk. It was crowded in the bar, so we decided to check upstairs in the main dining room. It was packed on the balcony so we decided to do first available in the restaurant area.We were offered sourdough bread (cold) and hard butter. Wasn't really feeling the bread, so just waited for our order. We ordered a half dozen blue point oysters ($10), salad and clam chowder bowl combo ($11.25), and the hot appetizer combo ($15.50). The combo was amazing!!! The combo came with shrimp, claims, oysters rockefeller, and mussels. The broth was outstanding!!! I used the bread and dipped it into the lemon and garlic broth. WOW!!!The oysters were awesome and the clam chowder had lots of clams. Chowder was definitely thick and hearty. I could have done without the salad.Great service for how busy it was. So glad our first meal when we arrived was at BB!",5 star rating,Maria C.

Seating outside overlooking the harbor can be great.The clam chowder and the hot combo were quite good. I also appreciated the crab cakes. Skip the tuna melt sandwich, it was just an un-flavorful mess.",3 star rating,Alessio S.
11/29/2016,"Milpitas, CA","Pretty impressed with Brophy Bros. But that might also be because I didn't have a wait at all -- I came in here solo and went straight to the bar upstairs. Had some of the delicious clam chowder, and the sea bass.The chowder was absolutely perfect. I honestly could probably just eat just chowder and be pretty satisfied. The sea bass though was full of flavor. I'm not sure if I'd order the sea bass again, but was really happy to have tried it.Also, I get the feeling I got lucky on parking since I found what seemed to be the only remaining empty parking spot in the lot. (Brophy Bros is located at the pier, so it seems to get pretty packed.) It was free parking when I came since it was in the evening, but there seemed to be paid parking in the larger lot. Looking at all of these reviews now, I'm really glad I didn't have to wait. Mmmm..just thinking about the chowder makes me hungry though. Will be back!And if you're just with a friend or dining solo, I would definitely recommend the bar if there's a free seat or two! Skip the wait!",5 star rating,Mitty C.
9/21/2018,"Santa Ana, CA","Best seafood on Santa Barbara, hands down. It's a must every time I'm in town.  Sometimes the wait is a little long but totally worth the wait.  Oyster shooters and the cioppino are my favorites.",5 star rating,Juan F.

We were lucky and were able to get a prime table on the balcony (I suspect the experience wouldn't be as good if you have to sit at a table inside).

4/23/2017,"Lompoc, CA","I have heard really good things about Brophy Bros...unfortunately I cannot agree with what I've heard. On a good note, the staff that helped us (hostess, waitress, busboy) were all very nice & attentive! We chose to sit in the deck upstairs. Not a good choice. The tables are spaced very close & the person behind me kept hitting my chair with hers. (Kind of like a little kid kicking the seat behind you on a plane) The tables are directly across the already narrow walkway from the open window bar. So if there's no room at the bar, patrons stand at the bar outside, making it nearly impossible for people to walk through. Needless to say, they're right on top of you when you're trying to eat. I had the pleasure of hearing the ego maniac bartender trying to rip the kid who brought the French bread a new one because the kid was trying to be a step ahead of the game & getting people their bread as they were being seated, rather than having to wait for it. The kid stood up to him (yay kid!) and explained why he was doing what he did. Like I said...the staff that we had contact with were great. The food...I had the calamari plate & the boyfriend had the shrimp plate. He said his was good, but mine was mediocre. The calamari was lightly  breaded,which was great, but unfortunately it didn't seem like they kept it in the fryer long enough. It was undercooked, not to the point of getting sick from it, but it could have stayed in a minute or 2 longer. The French fries were good. I ordered a Bloody Mary....presentation (compared to the Boathouse up the road) was lacking BUT the flavor was great! Ego maniac bartender knows how to mix a Bloody Mary. Needless to say I won't be going back to Brophy Bros. it's a tourist stop (I get that) but I think they could put a little more attention on their food.",2 star rating,Jana S.
9/18/2018,"Long Beach, CA",Had lunch here. Service was attentive if slow at times.  My clam bake wasn't best - 2 out of 6 were too chewy to eat. The wife's clam chowder was good she said.

5/16/2017,"Enfield, NH","Wow what a popular place! But the servers turn those tables over fast and they were amazing friendly and efficient. We got the peel & eat shrimp which was a nice serving size, and then hubby got the sesame salmon salad and I got the blackened chicken salad. His salmon was so fresh and hot off the grill, and my blackened chicken was so delicious that even people who dislike salads would love this. So much flavor and actually a bit spicy for me but still very good! Highly recommend if you don't mind waiting! We got a beeper and we were able to go to a bar next door before our table was ready.",5 star rating,Vickie R.
7/5/2018,"Simi Valley, CA","Crowded. Loud. Cramped. Not usually the way you like to describe a restaurant but, with Brophy Brothers, these descriptions actually enhance your experience rather than detract. You see, this is where everyday becomes an impromptu party or holiday with cold beer, great conversation, excellent service and some of the best chowder on the West Coast! When the crowd spills out onto the small outcropping that serves as outside seating and standing room only bar, the party is just getting started! If quieter climates are craved, you can escape downstairs to the bar and hang out there instead. Still just as crowded and lively, but usually a little more tame. Brophy Brothers is a small place with big fun and big eats. Put on your shorts, surf tees and join the party!",4 star rating,Peter G.

Both my wife and I lost our appetites after that.  My wife loves crab cakes and she only ate about a quarter of hers after seeing the raw fish.  The servers are mostly young and don't have basic food knowledge.  Even when the table next to me asked the server how long can she can keep her fish, to eat later without refrigeration.  The servers reply was ""I'm sure you can keep it out over night, but I'm not a fish expert.""",1 star rating,Trey L.

I had ordered a cup and instantly regretted not getting the bowl!As my entree I ordered the fried shrimp which was also very good!! The presentation & taste were exceptional.  I wish I lived closer so I could come here often!!!

12/25/2012,"Pasadena, CA","Great seafood place near the shore. Spacious with two levels of floor. We came early for dinner, and didn't wait to be seated. We had the tequila with clamari combo, the drink tasted really weird, it's just like vodka shots, or in other word, too strong! But the calamari was really good. Perfectly fried! With great taste. I had a crab and shrimp salad. It was really good, big portion, flavorful crab and shrimp, the whole salad is a good dish! But my friends grilled ahi was a little bland. It was a huge piece of fish, so price vise it was really good deal. But it really lacked flavor. This would be my second seafood choice in Santa Barbara!",4 star rating,Priscilla Z.
6/24/2015,"Mountain View, CA","A group of 5 of us came here for dinner. When we got there, we were told a wait time of 45 minutes. The place was packed! They gave us a pager and said they would buzz us when our table was ready. We took this opportunity to walk along the pier and take some photos. When we were finally buzzed, we were led to 2 small tables pushed together. Not a lot of table space but we made it work. They brought out a basket of bread and some butter (yay!) while we perused the menu. I could decide if I wanted clam chowder of fried calamari so I got them both. They were both excellent! In hindsight I should have only ordered one item because I couldn't finish my food. Everyone at the table thought the calamari was delicious and had a good batter to meat ratio.The reason this place gets 5 stars is because of the fantastic service. One of my friends does not eat cheese and she ordered a chicken salad with house dressing without knowing that the dressing had cheese blended into it. She only took a bite of her salad and couldn't continue eating it. We signaled the waitress and told her about our dilemma. She graciously offered to take the salad away and bring back a new salad with a different dressing that didn't have cheese. She brought back exactly that and this time with the dressing on the side, just in case. Then, at the end of our meal we were all doing calculations on how much we owed and she stopped by our table and offered to separate our checks. Amazing! Most restaurants never off to split checks and none have done so with 5 orders. She was just awesome.If you find yourself in Santa Barbara looking for seafood, come here! Great food and great service!",5 star rating,Christina L.

The crab cakes hardly had any crab in them and were bland, the seabass was tasty but very dry, and the mahi mahi was completely flavorless. I'm not sure if the chef just forgot to season it, but even the mango and papaya relish didnt taste like anything. The service here is not consistent either. The last time I came, we were not served bread when all the tables around us were. I personally don't understand the hype about this place.

I thought we'd give it another try since they now use Alaskan Pollock so that's at least a step up. Unfortunately, the taste wasn't much better. Bland and very mushy.

The service was top notch. We had an amazing view of the harbor & wharf and we got to see them shuck oysters. Pretty cool, eh? Hubby had the clam chowder & house salad and I had the hot combo & a bloody mary. HOT DAYUM all were yummy. I would've liked a little more seasoning to the clam/mussel combo but really, just some salt & a squeeze of lemon did the trick.

The outside seating has great views but unfortunately you have waiters walking and people standing in the narrow walkway. Not relaxing at all. The Manhattans were bad.

If there isn't room to sit you can stand atthe outside bar windows.  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and seemed to actually like his job.  The fish sandwhich is a pretty good deal at $10.95.

So he said I should get the mahi mahi and they'd use oil for the fish, no butter. Rice was the side dish. I tasted it and it tasted like butter. The waitress said there was tons of butter in the rice. How could the bartender miss this? He's worked there for many years. The wish was raw inside. Then he brought me some prawns. I saw him drop the plate of prawns and pick them off the floor, return them to the plate, and deliver it to me. Oh my god!!!! Who does this??? He didn't think I could see this. I'm appalled.

Since I'm a big fan of New England clam chowder, I order a cup of it. The clam chowder was very hearty.

You could taste the freshness of the oysters. Next I ordered the fish n chips which were just remarkable, the fish was sooo fresh and tender, amazing flavors. I have never been a huge fan of fish and chips but after this meal, it is my favorite dish. I am scared to eat fish and chips anywhere else now because I know it will taste like shit compared to how good these were. We sat on the balcony and were able to see the fishing boats unloading buckets of crab and sea urchin, all in all, it was a great experience, I will for sure be back and I still can't stop thinking about those fish and chips, so get yourself some !!!",5 star rating,Rene W.

The best item I tried today was the clam chowder. The ciopinno is just ok. The flavor of the sherry is too prevalent. The crab cake is just  disappointing. Everything on the dish (crab cake, Cole slaw, and even the sauce are underseasoned, the rice is undercooked).",3 star rating,El W.

The seafood pasta was very garlic heavy, but good overall. What was disappointing is when I picked up my last piece of fish I found a long-ish piece of black hair. My husband called the waitress over and showed her. She said, ""would you like another piece or are you just telling me?"". My husband said it was for awareness, she replied ""ok"", took the plate, and left. :-( An apology would have been nice.

The 45 minute wait was even worth it, as the food quality is up to par, not to mention the walk around the harbor you can do to pass the time! Service is amazing, even when we felt like we bugged them one too many for more bread baskets. The clam chowder bowl comes in a large quantity for what you pay for and goes well with the bread! Easily sharable. THE OYSTER SHOOTER... my goodness. I was pretty nervous that it was not worth the hype and price, but it exceeded my expectations. The ingredients are incredibly fresh, and the combo of ingredients is perfect. Felt like getting a variety today, but other days I always go for the famous fish and chips!

What it does have going for it is location.  Located in Santa Barbara harbor it's a great place to look out at the water and see all that happens.  The service was sub par.  My hubby had the ahi salad which he enjoyed (though not as much as the one he had had at the Santa Barbara Brewery the day before).  I had the crab cakes which were terrible.  Was served with clam chowder which was very good.Was very disappointed in this visit.  Have visited the location in Ventura many times and always been very happy with service and menu selections.  This was just ok.... kind of a bummer.If you must visit have a cocktail and bowl of chowder and move on..... so many other options with way better food and service.,3 star rating,Kellie B.

The drinks are good (although a bit pricey) and the staff and vibe was cool.  The food, while good, never impressed me. Fast forward 27 years. I've eaten at many more restaurants and know good food and value and frankly Brophy's has neither. When you have a $30 fish meal and best thing you can say about it was the bread was good you wonder why you came. Don't get me wrong, I still like Brophy's but I'm just not going there for a full meal anymore. Drink and a appetizer with a view will be good for me.",3 star rating,Jon M.

5/5/2014,"Burbank, CA","When I searched for a good dinner place in Santa Barbara, Brophy Bros. came up high on the results with everyone praising the clam chowder here. So of course this is where I dragged my mum to dinner on our SB trip. This area has a lot of parking but apparently you have to be careful where you park; we parked in a section that was 90 minute free parking but unlimited after 6PM. Since we were there for dinner, that was perfect for us (not that we needed more than 90 minutes). We were there around 5:30PM but already there was a wait for the patio (10-15 minutes) so we said we would sit inside.They started us off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter. For our entrees, we got the following:(Mum) BOWL OF BROPHY'S NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER-- You can get this as a cup ($4.75) or bowl ($7.25) and my mum decided that since this was what they were famous for, this would be her complete dinner. She thought it was just okay; she liked how chunky it was but also thought it was really salty. While she was able to enjoy her meal by adding Tabasco to the chowder and eating it with the sourdough bread, she was not a fan of it.(Esther) SEAFOOD PASTA: Gulf shrimp and sea scallops sauteed with garlic, lemon, white wine, tomato, basil, and served over linguini, topped with Parmesan cheese. Served with cole slaw AND your choice of tossed green salad or a cup of our New England Clam Chowder AND your choice of rice pilaf or french fries.-- Boy did I make a mistake. I wanted the clam chowder, but I didn't want JUST the clam chowder. I really should have gone with one of their fried seafood options and just added a cup of clam chowder, but I decided to go for an entree since it would already come with the soup. Out of the entrees, the pasta sounded good (I *love* pasta and I was going to take full advantage of my cheating on my no-wheat diet this night) so I got it. Big mistake. So I never got the cole slaw, but I didn't care since I was focused on the clam chowder. I thought it was good, albeit quite salty, and was decently full after eating it. Then my pasta came out. I excitedly dug in... only to be disappointed by how bland the dish was. It was ridiculously bland. And then where were my fries?! It was then that I realised my server had never even asked me if I wanted fries or rice pilaf. I managed to flag her down and ask about it, and she told me people didn't usually want fries with their pasta so she didn't bother to ask. Excuse me?! I understand people not eating pasta with fries (I admit it's a bit odd) but at least give me the choice! So she went and put in an order of fries for me. They didn't take too long and were fresh and good. So I finished the fries and then got the pasta packaged to take home.Our server was quite nice and friendly, and I also appreciated the male server who helped out near the end. I do, however, hold it against my server that she didn't even ask me about the sides that come with my entree. She never brought me the cole slaw and she also didn't even ask me if I wanted french fries or rice pilaf, or perhaps neither. I would have missed out on food if I had not read that part of the menu! (I still did because I forgot about the cole slaw, but I also don't care about cole slaw.) And while the clam chowder was good, it was also really salty (I drank a ridiculous amount of water for the rest of the night) and I did not enjoy my seafood pasta at all. Therefore I cannot bring myself to give them any more than three stars (which is still a-ok!).",3 star rating,Esther K.

And she had incredibly white teeth.

4/1/2014,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA","This is a really fun little seafood restaurant in Santa Barbara Harbor.  I was told that it has Brophy's since the 80's but was under another name before that and has been known as more of a locals place in the past, although that seems to be changing. It is on the second floor of a building overlooking the marina with a slender outdoor seating area and a bar that opens from the inside to a standing bar in the outdoor area.  It's snug walking past the patrons and dodging the servers, but the vibe is cool and I enjoyed standing as I waited for a table.  At the bar: I ordered oyster shooters:  a shot glass with a freshly shucked oyster (you can watch your oysters being shucked in front of you), cocktail sauce, some horseradish and a bit of fresh parmesan cheese on top.  You mix it together and shoot it down.  They have a bit of a kick to them along with great flavor.  I also ordered one vodka oyster shooter.  It watered down the spiciness and was not my favorite.  I shared a split of  their house champagne with my dining partner for the bar and the meal as well.  At the table:My friend had the Cold Combo which consisted of crab meat, ceviche, oysters, clams and peel and eat shrimp. We enjoyed everything except the ceviche and we just didn't care for the flavor.  I had the grilled swordfish with french fries.  It was very fresh with great texture but needed a bit of added seasoning for me.  I loved being outside watching people walk around in the marina and looking at all the beautiful boats.  Service:  The bartender was quick and funny. At the table, our server was prompt and kept our water filled and was attentive without being overbearing.",4 star rating,Theresa B.

Was seated outside and had a terrific view of the water.  Our waitress was really nice and introduced her favorites on the menu.  Overall the food was standard, not spectacular, just standard. While we waited the seagulls kept us company but we were told not to repay them back in food. I'd say it was a nice place to chill with fresh seafood. The lasting impression was made by the shrimp shooter. Its like a shot glass with cocktail sauce and a piece of shrimp or oyster depending on what you order. It was A M A Z I N G G G... I think it'll be the closest I'll ever get to knowing how Peter Parker felt when he first transformed into the Spiderman. My friend described the feeling after you take it as, ""heightened senses""... I cannot agree more... haha. You literally SEE clearer, HEAR better, BREATH deeper... That shot definitely woke us up.

I suggest taking a look at the bar menu before putting your name down and having to wait for a seat upstairs. Luckily my boyfriend and I wanted the fried foods and that's what was mainly on the bar menu so it worked out perfectly. No wait and got to choose our seats outside.

4/20/2014,"Fremont, CA","After moving to Santa Barbara and spending time at the beach, I really wanted to try their seafood. I'm an oyster lover, so after finding this spot on yelp, I had to try it.Raw Oysters (3.5/5): Fresh oysters served with what seems like a home made cocktail sauce. Why not 5 stars? For one, inconsistency. One time I ordered a dozen oysters and two over them were a little bigger than a quarter. Another time, they were all average sized. A third, came with one small one. If i'm paying $20 for a dozen oysters, I expect them to all be average sized. Clam Chowder (4.5/5): Their clam chowder is enough reason to check out Brophy. It has the perfect amount of clam flavor, a good portion of clam pieces, it's creamy, and not too salty. I like to eat it with the bread they serve you. A MUST try!!Mahi Mahi (3/5): Nothing special. The fish had nice grill marks on it and was cooked well, but it was just so plain. I was excited about the mango and papaya relish, but it fell very short of my expectations, nothing special there either. Sadly the best thing about this was their thin cut fries. I would NOT order this again.Their service is lacking. The waiters and waitresses aren't that attentive and we had to flag them down EVERY TIME we needed something. By the end of our meal, it got pretty annoying.Overall, I only come back for the clam chowder and oysters. After my experience with the mahi mahi, I don't want to try another plain fish for $20+.PRO-TIP: Get a seat on their deck, the beautiful view and outside setting is worth the wait!",3 star rating,Jamie A.

Armed with having a great experience here the last time, I had no trouble recommending a place to eat when a few other friends rolled up for a day trip.There were 4 of us this time and we thought, 5pm on a Sunday, shouldn't be too bad... well, it wasn't ""too bad"", but it was sure crowded. After an afternoon of walking about the town and then going on a hike up to Inspiration Point, we were ready to eat!Lucky for us, they had a small bar area where we decided to have some chowda as we waited to be called for dinner. The area is pretty tiny, but we managed to snag a table and borrow a few chairs so that everyone could sit. The cups of chowda were quickly ordered and served by the bartender. Although I've been completely ruined by living in Boston and will always swear by their versions of this soup, I have to say, Brophy Bros did a great job! There were chunks of clam and the broth had just the right amount of creaminess. Because of this, the bf decided to have a 2nd round as a choice when he ordered his entree.Although it was cold out, we asked for first available and ended up on the patio. There were heat lamps, but the lighting was a bit minimal.One friend ordered the salmon salad (I've had this before and it is a really good deal and tastes awesome!), another had the fish sandwich (looked amazing and she really enjoyed it), the bf had the seafood pasta, which was filled with seafood and was delish! I had the cioppino. I have no idea why they call this ""fish stew"" as it had so much more than just fish! Shrimp, clams, oysters, it had it all and was huge! Perfect on the cold night. Makes me drool just remembering it. Overall, we had a great experience and I can't wait to find another excuse to come back.",4 star rating,Kim V.
3/2/2014,"Westminster, CA","There are worse ideas than having a seafood lunch at the restaurant with a fantastic view of the harbor. A four-star Yelp average indicated that it probably didn't suck, so up the narrow stairs we trekked, past the dark and musty type of bar where ""everybody knows your name"", to the cramped but appropriately salty dining area above. Ah, light and air!  We were seated outside  on a sheltered ""patio"" balcony. Food Breakdown: Everything I'd read in the reviews pointed to the appetizers and clam chowder as being the best bets, and the reviews did not lie.  The garlic baked clams had been recommended by a local friend; they were certainly the five-star experience of our meal. From there on, each item settled into ho-hum territory: The New England clam chowder was creamy and clam-full, (perhaps four-star worthy) but the sea bass and fish n chips were straight up Red Lobster/H.Salt clones. Nothing special to report on either dish. On future Santa Barbara visits, I certainly won't go out of my way to find Brophy Bros -- I mean, when in a town known for creative gourmet menus inspired by cuisine from all over the globe, one shouldn't have to settle for seafood that was inspired by Long John Silvers.But hey, the view could nearly make up for the boring food. There is something about sitting high above the hustle and bustle below while you sip cool beverages and take in that refreshing sea air, while meditating on the seascape beyond, which elevates any mediocre lunch experience. By virtue of the fact that Brophy Bros has both an unbeatable location (captive pier tourists) *and* a fantastic view of the marina, I predict that it will hang on for many years to come.",3 star rating,Anna R.

7/3/2016,"Phoenix, AZ","The long and short of it. Told 45 minute wait but it was 1.5 hour wait on a Friday night, too late to go anywhere else, we had to stay after waiting an hour. The meal was very basic, nothing special or noteworthy, pretty much a bust. Visiting from the Arizona desert, the fish entrés didn't taste any different than fish I've had before. I'm bewildered by the good reviews, it's definitely not worth our wait time, I wouldn't even wait 30 minutes, knowing what I know now.  The staff was good, considering the chaos of the annoyed people waiting, endless stream of incoming patrons and tiny seating area of the restaurant.Oh, and the staircase next to the downstairs bar is the entrance to the restaurant. It's an oddly arranged place and use of space.",3 star rating,Dani S.

7/17/2016,"San Jose, CA","Went here to celebrate our 2-year anniversary a few months ago and couldn't have picked a better place. It's right on the harbor so the views were amazing, especially since we chose to eat outside. That made our wait a little bit longer but we spent that time exploring the harbor waiting for our pager to buzz. We ordered fried calamari, the cold combo (crab meat, ceviche, oysters, clams, & shrimp), and then we each ordered a seafood pasta as our entree. He got his with clam chowder and french fries, and I got mine with the salad and french fries. These portions are BIG and we both ended up taking home most of our pasta as leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It was the perfect place for us to casually celebrate our anniversary. The only downsides is that they don't take reservations and the restaurant itself is very small and pretty cramped, which is why I took off a star, but I think the wait was worth it.",4 star rating,Isabelle N.
3/15/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Place is always buzzing and happy that it withstood the last storm we had a few weeks back. The staff are courteous and the atmosphere is lively and fun. Great views of the harbor when you sit in the outdoor patio. My go-to dish are the fish n chips. Brophy's pretty much ruins fish n chips for everyone else because they just do it absolutely right every time. Mouthwatering and delicately crispy on the outside and tender flaky tasty goodness on the inside. Combine that with a couple oyster shooters and a bowl of clam chowder and you're in fresh seafood heaven. For fresh fairly priced seafood, Brophy's is a sure thing!See you there!",5 star rating,Niccolo L.

I have had their ahi salad, salmon salad, ceviche, clam chowder, cioppino, shrimp, and sol. All of it is outstanding. There are no reservations, and on weekends it gets REALLY crowded so there is at least a 45 minute wait, which kind of sucks. However it's in such a lovely area that the wait time can be easily filled by walking around and taking in the beautiful ocean view. It's an experience to go here. I love it!",5 star rating,Halley T.

12/11/2014,"Chattanooga, TN","When trying to decide where to eat in a new city, we ask around a lot.  Sometimes we get a lot of different suggestions and sometimes we get one restaurant recommended over and over.  Such was the case with Brophy Brother's Restaurant and Clam Bar in Santa Barbara.  We were told that we had to go there and we had to get the clam chowder.  Being good tourists, we did what we were told and it was perfect!!Brophy Brothers is right on the harbor and is two stories.  There is outside dining in a narrow ledge around the edge of the building.  Even though the wait might be longer, we decided to go for eating outside to make the experience even more memorable.  We sat at the bar downstairs and barely had  time drink about 1/2 our glass of wine before our name was called.I instagramed our view (it was gorgeous!) out into the harbor, as we ate the best clam chowder that we have ever eaten!   It was thick and rich with lots of clam and potatoes.  Absolutely perfect.Hubs got the Seafood Pasta for $18.95.  It was loaded with shrimp and scallops and perfectly seasoned.  I got the beer battered shrimp plate $9.75.  The shrimp were huge and lightly battered, the fries and cole slaw were good.Every thing was perfect, the view was beautiful, the food was wonderful.  Highly recommend!",5 star rating,Pam G.
3/29/2016,"Santa Monica, CA","Sometimes I'm a tourist and embrace that rare desire to immerse myself into a tourist trap. The Santa Barbara marina was my destination and we did well. Lots of fanny-pack folk, but once we sat down overlooking the marina, we just aimed our eyes at kayakers and stand-up paddle boarders miserably failing at their sport in flat water... worked perfectly fine. Food is great and generous for the price. We split 6 excellent oysters, a ceviche (that while tasty had the make-up more of a salsa) and a delicious plate of swordfish. I'm normally hesitant to choose swordfish because it tends to be tough when not super fresh, but the waitress assured us it was local and it ended up as a top contender-- like a melt-in-your-mouth swordfish. Sounds weird, right? Order it if it's on the menu. Would recommend asking for seats on the balcony; if you're going to stare at an endless conglomerate of boats, may as well do so from an elevated vantage point.",4 star rating,Noah G.

Besides, the place isn't that big, so my rec...avoid dinner time...either arrive early or later in the evening. I loved the unpretentious vibe of this place. Seemed like a real chill place to eat/drink alongside the harbor. I started off with the clam chowder, which hit the spot. The real star of the place, in my opinion, was the The Hot Combo (beer broiled shrimp, steamed clams, oysters rock, steamed mussles and stuffed clams) which I got as my meal (it's an app).

They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is on the second level balcony where it overlooks the docks with mountains in the background. Beautiful. We had indoor seating(it was getting chilly) and our waitress was very helpful and quick. The prices were good for the portions. The fish and chips were beer battered and medium crispiness.

Both tartar and marinara sauce were sharp and tangy. Coleslaw, and fries also came on a generously portioned plate perfect for sharing.

6/24/2016,"Encinitas, CA","Great view and great food! Lots of restaurants in Santa Barbara get away with having mediocre food because they make up for it with an ocean view or downtown patio seating, but Brophy's is one of the few places in town with both. The fish & chips were great! The fish was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It easily flaked as well, which is a good indication it was fresh and that it was not overcooked. What really convinced me that they were top-notch is that my boyfriend (from England) also thought they were good. But of course, still not as good as the ones he's had in England. Though he did mention that the ""chips"" were not very good. I have to disagree but his opinion might be worth more than mine in the fish & chips department. I will however, say that they are pretty stingy with their fries. I took one star off because our server wasn't very attentive. It's pretty easy to tell when one of your five tables is trying to get your attention, yet we still ate our food without the sides we would've wanted with it. Not the biggest deal but also such an easy thing to do so it's difficult to be forgiving.",4 star rating,Lianne S.

Something to know:~dinner hours, the place gets busy and they provide you with one of those vibrators. ..(while that might pass the time) get your mind out of the gutter, its not for that.  Finally, if you survey 1000 Santa Barbarians, chances are extremely high Brophy Bros would be selected as the #1 restaurant based on price, dining experience and value. Yep, it's tasty!",5 star rating,Ikler R.

6/27/2018,"Venice, CA","The epitome of what a dining experience is meant to be.  SB has a handful of restaurants thats worth going to, but being trendy, over priced, understaffed and staffed rudely does not an experience make, unless of course it's a been there, done that, don't ever need that again.Broph's is the BEST view in SBHas the BEST staff in SB- and when I say best, let me dig deeper.They are friendly, attentive, clear things out of your way when done, and NEVER has made anyone feel uncomfortable no matter how you're dressed.  You have fancy tourist, to salty dog locals, and everyone gets treated the same.  Even better, if a bartender remembers your face, you're likely to have your favorite drink ready before you had time to think about what you wanted.  Has enough variety on the menu that even if you don't like seafood, there are options.We go there all the time, because nothing in this town can beat the full package- bravo Broph's for making this spot home!",5 star rating,bananas T.

12/9/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","A Santa Barbara favorite with a high reputation. If you love having the view of the Wharf (I personally think it is beautiful). Being a local, I have gotten many things over the years-but recently I got the Mahi Mahi and was a bit disappointed. The Mahi itself didn't have much flavor, thank goodness it was dressed with the mango and papaya relish to liven up the dish (thus they got a 4 instead of the 5 it should have). The Clam chowder is a must here, it is as fresh as clam chowder can get and it will leave you wanting more. I usually stick to main entrees/specials, but a little hidden on the menu (somewhere in the back or bottom) you will see they have a Tuna Melt sandwich. I usually get sandwiches from the Deli, but this is different and a MUST. You should try this beautiful dish. I think I remember it being open faced, so clarify that if that matters to you. Either way, one or two pieces of bread doesn't matter to me-it was the tuna that I won't forget this gift from the sea.",4 star rating,Anabella L.
12/9/2013,"Berkeley, CA","Brophy Bros. Well, well, well. This tourist trap/hype got me. I wouldn't wait an hour again for this spot although the price point is on the less expensive side (esp for Santa B), the portions are large and the seafood was fresh, but there wasn't really anything to write home about. And please, dear lord, don't wait like I stupidly did for over an hour.Located on the water, there are some pretty damn good views and again the place has solid value. Where are you ever going to find a place for $20 that you get soup, salad and a heaping portion of fish? The food wasn't all that though. I didn't love my chowder, the baked clams were heavy on the breading, but I admit my fish was tasty. For how busy this place was, service was good and really friendly. I'd like to reiterate, this is definitely a tourist spot.If you can snag a seat at the bar and/or visit when there isn't a 2 hour wait, I'd say give it a whirl, but other than that, not sure I'd revisit.",3 star rating,Stephanie Y.

The clam chowder was super yummy and my favorite. The baked clams and fish and chips were good but nothing I feel I would fun back for. Service was good and friendly. Note: you're not allowed to have your dog on the patio even though it is outside. We didn't have one but a few people wanted to sit outside but the server had to tell them no. I guess something about a city ordinance? So if you have a dog, you have to tie them up to the side.",4 star rating,Thao D.
2/12/2016,"San Diego, CA",Good view from 2nd floor balcony! Waited half hour for Friday lunch time. Good sized clam chowder & house salad for $11. The cold combo -- we were able to get extra crab meat + ceviche (leaving out cold clam and oysters) ended up coming out as a huge meat platter good for 3 people. Mussel appetizer was served with a white wine sauce on side. It tasted like old white wine sewage. I never ever send dishes back to save myself looking like an asshole but I've had tons of mussel dishes and this was bunk. Maybe the main dishes like mahi & other fish are the go to here. I would try again but this visit was not all that impressive. Atmosphere is super casual overlooking beautiful commercial fishing dock. Bustling and loud.,4 star rating,Grennan K.

1/23/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Horrible serving/customer service experience.I was there on 12/20/15 around 11 am to 1pm with my boyfriend. We are shy people and my boyfried doesn't like making complains at restaurants. I was so upset to leave the review but hopes this might help others. I believe we didn't do anything to deserve the serving that we recieved that day. First, we had to wait so long to order things and get more water while other tables were constantly having servers coming to their table for water and needs. I was waving raising my hand all the time while I was there. My arms were barely on the table to focus on eating. It took 20 minutes to get a cup of coke but they gave me ginerale. Second, we didn't get a server to serve. We first order to a serving lady but after then it was the cleaning crew who came to drop our food and drinks. Third, there was some kind of plastic in my soup. I asked about this to the sever but she didn't even look at it and bothered to stop to answer the question. She just passed our table and said it's cheese. After these incidents I just got suspicous if these people don't want to serve us because we were not white.Don't want to bring up this racial issue and saw other non-white people's review, but still can't understand why we were treated like that on that day.",1 star rating,Jinny K.

11/7/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","This isn't the first review I have written for Brophy's.   It was five star then and it is five star now.   I am writing this review because I feel that I have wronged the place and kind of feel guilty.   I love the view, the people who work there, the people who go there, the strong margaritas, the clam chowder, the beer boiled shrimp and all of the things I wrote about before.  I love the place and recommend it A LOT but I have always told people to order the ""Oyster bar"" food, that it was that kind of a place, not fine dining.   I suggested that if they want Seabass or Ahi with side dishes and sauces that they might be better served going to one of the competitors (all who seem to be owned by the same group.)  But yesterday I stepped out of the box.  Ordered the blackened Seabass with the tarragon sauce that they serve with the Ahi.   It was absolutely wonderful!!   My friend had the crab cakes and they very well could be the best I have eaten.   The entrée was one of their most expensive, $24 and well worth it!  So again Brophy's, my bad!  You rock it on the fancy food too.  I would like to add that if you go to Brophy's expect it to be busy.  It is very rare that you don't wait for a table!    The wait is fun, you might meet Harbor John or another regular, or some fascinating person who are in town on vacation.   Order a drink and enjoy the sourdough bread.   There are worse places to have to wait for a table.    And when YOU Yelp them, don't knock them down for being popular, that is to their credit!   If you waited an hour, or the place was too crowded it is because they are good.   It would be like bashing a Ferrari for being too fast and scary to drive, Hawaii for being too warm or Mount Everest for being too big.",5 star rating,Douglas M.

11/12/2018,"Fontana, CA","One of my husbands favorite restaurants is Brophy Bros in Santa Barbara. He has to make it out to them at least once a year for their amazing clam chowder. Him, his crew and men from 4 other departments were sent to fight the Woosley fire on Friday morning. They have worked endlessly and tirelessly the last few days, most recently in south Malibu on structure protection. They legit worked 24 hours fighting multiple structure fires barely eating dinner last night at 1030pm. For those of you that also don't know, some days they get sent with a couple sack lunches and granola bars for a 24 hour shift without anything warm in the 50 degree weather. They are lucky enough to be staying in a hotel for a warm shower and rest in Santa Barbara tonight. I called Brophy Bros knowing that the chances that they were actually able to go there to eat was nonexistent. The manager Scott was amazing. He instantly and selflessly offered to drive to their hotel after he got off work to drop off some amazing food. I offered to pay but he said that he would be more than happy to cover the costs, even after I mentioned that there were 20 firemen, he said he would figure it out. I am so appreciative of Scott, he really doesn't know how much his gesture meant to me.I understand that this is a fireman's 'job' but no one really understands how relentless they work even though they are doing physical work hour after hour with unyielding aches and pains. A delicious warm meal of Brophy Bros clam chowder makes all that work just seem a little bit easier.",5 star rating,Laura G.

Start with the view, they need a couple of starving artists perched around the dock to capture the beauty of this place: the harbor, mountains, and ocean - all from one seat. I could easily sit here for days. The place is casual, down-to-earth - no need to dress your best. The food is good too, although I personally can't eat the shellfish - I could smell it from afar.

10/12/2015,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA","I gotta be honest. I love Santa Barbara because of its serene, calm beaches and piers, the clam chowder, and beach-like atmosphere and chill environment but the people here are mostly assholes.Of course, unless you're white or white-washed. Allow me to explain the second part. If you're not white but are assimilated into the SB American white culture, then you'll talk, look, walk the part. I stood out like a sore thumb because I wasn't one of the RVCA-wearing, Oakley-sporting, flip-flip walking, ""dudes"" that either looked like I just came out of the ocean or walked out of a high-end, vegan clothing store.Swung by this restaurant with a few friends while I was visiting because I had heard that they had some pretty good dishes and after barely finding parking, we were able to get there just in time to see someone leaving and took over their table. At my friend's suggestion, I ordered their soup and waited while enjoying the California sunset over a few beers. My friends' orders came out after about 15 mins but mine didn't. So I waited while they enjoyed their meals. And waited. Finally, after thinking maybe they forgot to place my order, I went inside to check up on it. I waited by the bar for one of the 3 servers to come by. And I waited. I waited for about 20 mins. During that time, other people walked in and ordered and got their order, I made plenty of hand gestures, eye contact, directly talking to them, etc with no avail. It was as if I was invisible.Finally, one of my friends walked in and got the attention of the waitress and shared with her their disappointment. She apologized. To him. Again, I didn't exist. After getting their attention and seeing where my order was (they ""forgot"" to put it in and said they didn't see me trying to wave them down at the bar), I went back to my seat and wait for my soup to come out. And waited.My friend went in again by himself and after 5 mins, my soup was out. Maybe I had an off-day with everyone working at the restaurant but seeing that everyone else was getting their orders, getting friendly responses, and not being purposely ignored, I doubt I'll ever be back. And this wasn't exactly the first place to do this to me in SB.My friends tell me that maybe it's because I look like a ""homeless"" person with my unkempt facial hair but I know that's just an excuse because there were plenty of ""homeless"" looking white men in there that got prompt service.2 stars because the view was nice (though it's not necessary to be at the restaurant to enjoy the view) and the soup was decent.Parking: Depending on time of day and day of the wk, you'll either find plenty of parking, or none at allPrice: $8+ per personWait: 15 mins if you're white, no service if you're not",2 star rating,Pourio L.

The oysters were perfectly fine, but after a hour of eating the ceviche (which my mother only had a small bite of) I immediately realized that I had food poisoning.

Heaters were on so the temperature was perfect. I started off with the calamari which was tasty. I ordered the seafood pasta (shrimp and scallops with linguini) and it was very good. However the bowl is awkwardly small for the portion so it was hard to get the perfect bite without sauce and noodles splashing out of the bowl. My boyfriend ordered the seabass and it was juicy and delicious. The clam chowder (included with specials) was one of the best I have tried in SB. The food was great, but the service was not..hence the reason I give 3 stars. SERVICE IS EVERYTHING! My waitress (who's name was not even introduced) never checked on us and only simply refilled my boyfriends water without a word about how we were doing. When I needed a straw or extra napkins I had to flag down a busboy or waitress for another table because mine was nowhere in sight.

Their fish and chips, clam chowder, oysters, calamari, and baked clams are always a win. They don't try to spin anything here. It is traditionally prepared seafood that you would expect. Their food is always fresh and tasty. Their oyster shooters with a shot are spicy. The bartender was very generous with the vodka! It looks a little harsh (like vomit) but it was very tasty in the end. I'd recommend getting a seat in the patio if it is a nice day. It is a gorgeous view of Santa Barbara harbor.

The Oysters Rockefeller were pretty good. My favorite were the Oyster shooters! Those were pretty darn good and so fresh. They have lots of bar specials here with alcohol + apps.

Wow, this place really sucks now. We waited an hour and 10 min (with a 5 and 2 year old) to get a table. We ordered clams, clam chowder, kids pasta, fish and chips, milk for the kids and two beers (IPA's). Here's how our order fared:Clams: Inedible. So much sand! Sand on the plate, in the broth, dripping out of the clams...so, so bad! Sent them back.Clam chowder: Pretty good.Kids Pasta: Nuthin' but a bowl of linguine. No butter, no sauce, nada. Just noodles. Daughter didn't eat a bite.Fish and Chips: limp, oily, flavorless fish and chips. You couldn't pick the piece of fish up without it falling apart. It had no flavor other then oil. So bad!Milk: How do you mess this up? My daughter complained it was too sweet, so I tasted it and literally it tasted like someone had mixed sugar into it. Same went for my sons. Waste of $7 because both were not drank.Beer: came in cans. Wtf?! I remember ice cold draft beers at this place.$80 down the drain. We will never come back. Ever. Gone is another legacy. :(",1 star rating,Tori D.
3/3/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",Waited for an hour for a table based on high yelp reviews. Unfortunately it was underwhelming. Calamari was good. Hot appetizer sampler was not great - mussels were not cleaned (still had the grimy beards) clams were rubbery and hot clam and oysters lacked taste. The prawns were the only highlight. Crab cakes were ok but kind of bland. Unfortunately not worth the wait but the service was great which was a nice plus,3 star rating,Michelle C.

4/2/2018,"Cerritos, CA",Very very crowded here. There's a small bar that offers small plates downstairs. The second floor has the restaurant but we barely could get through the door. The food we ordered was the clam chowder which was pretty good on a cold day. And their drinks were pretty good as well. I'm sure we would've had a better time if it wasn't too crowded at their restaurant.,3 star rating,Jenny L.
5/4/2016,"Dallas, TX","I was visiting, and I was hanging out with a friend in the area. His co worker told us that this place was the best place around. I'm not sure where he got that idea, I found the service to be good but the wait was extremely long, the food was just average and the price was crazy high for what you got. Being that it's a fishing town, I can understand the menu choices but I found the options extremely limited, nonetheless.  If you're not wanting fish, you're getting steak. You literally have no other choice. Moreover, they only offer one steak. It was an average cut, for a pretty primo price. I would expect that same streak to be around 13-17 bucks... Not 20.00+. It was cooked correctly, so I will give them that. The sides are either a rice dish (which I had) or French fries. My rice tasted old and it was actually crunchy. I'm not sure why but I had a bite or two and that was enough of that. Pretty disappointing, considering the price point for the restaurant. My companion had a fish dish that he said was dry and lacked flavor. He was disappointed and specifically said ""I'm not even sure how you do this to fish"". The ambiance of this place is also lacking, it's pretty loud and really hard to have a conversation. Not a location I would suggest if you're trying to catch up with someone you haven't seen for a few years. It was packed, so I guess either this is typical for the area or it's just better than everything surrounding it. Whatever way you slice it, I cannot recommend this establishment. Lastly- I will give a shout-out to our server. She was incredibly sweet and she did her job well. She seemed to be enjoying her evening and that's nice to see. She, the nice hostess and sweet bus/bread guy are the reason for the 3 star review instead of a lower rating.",3 star rating,Rae I.

2/22/2014,"Monterey Park, CA","Stopped by on the way to wine tasting un SB.  The service was on par. Although they were busy we didnt feel rushed, which is a good thing. Had the Cold Plate Combo, the crabmeat was good, the shrimp was ok, the ceviche was citrusy n refreshing.  Also had the crab n shrimp salad. Nothing special but good. Oysters on a half shell was fresh but not plump and juicy which woulda been better. Although it looked pretty sad, it wasnt fishy which is always plus.  Lots of residual barnacles in the oysters we had so be careful. The best dish here was the clam chowder.  I would def come back for their chowder.  It had a pretty fair ratio of clams(plump and juicy) and potatoes which is a plus. Had enough sweetness n saltiness to round out the flavors. One of the best chowders I've had.",3 star rating,Lys T.

A dry filet of seabass at the end of a 3 hour wait. That's what people are waiting for. When the server finally brought the entrees, she didn't even mention that she was getting the rest. My friend had to ask when the others were coming out. The only thing keeping me from giving one star is my friends' fish and chips were decent.

I've never had a bad meal here--chowder isn't my bag but the tuna melt, fresh fish and beer boiled shrimp are a few of my favorites. If the Cole slaw recipe was up to me, I'd add more vinegar and make it less sweet...just a personal preference of mine. Great fries and fresh bread. Bartenders are on top of their game.

Be prepared for a wait as this is a touristy spot. The food here was just ok. Had the fish and chips which was cooked nicely but it came with a tiny bit of soggy French fries. Our group also had the oysters Rockefeller which was kind of gross. Overly creamy without any other flavor. The ceviche was also unimpressive --  essentially a giant plate of iceberg lettuce with a bit of fish mixed with pico de gallo. The fried shrimp were ok, again, served with a tiny bit of soggy French fries. Bloody Mary was also a thumbs-down -- tasted like anchovies with way too much salt and not enough vodka. You're paying for the location here and all you get for it is mediocre food at best and potentially a long wait. I won't be returning.",2 star rating,Natalia P.
10/19/2015,"New York, NY","A requisite tourist destination for Santa Barbara with solid food.

My date got the Fried Calamari, a surprisingly good Chopped Blackened Chicken Salad and decent Fish and Chips. We shared the Cioppino which was also very good. A good experience in Santa Barbara, literally on the water / pier.  3 stars for the food with an added 1 star for location.

1/6/2017,"Palm Springs, CA","Brophy's is one of those fun seafood joints that you find at a wharf or pier.  This one is right at the Santa Barbara Yacht Harbor and it's really good.  Located upstairs, with fine views overlooking all the yachts and fishing boats, it is noisy, crowded, bustling and atmospheric, filled with good smells and happy, friendly people.  We went for lunch, and had a wonderful time.Service was prompt and engaging, particularly noteworthy considering how busy the place always seems to be, and - I've got to make note - everyone that worked there had model good looks and an athletic vibe.  It was fun!The food, as you might expect, was fresh and tasty.  The chowder was really special and even the fried choices were light and crispy, not greasy.  Yumm.  Yumm.  Yumm.  My only suggestion is that, on the salads, I would have preferred crispy, chilled lettuces, (iceberg, romaine, etc), rather than the trendy greens everyone seems to serve these days.  A small nit: Our table constantly rocked on the uneven floor, which can't have been a new problem, and proved a bit irritating.  It should have been an easy fix.All-in-all, Brophy Bros a great, atmospheric and tasty place for lunch in beautiful Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Sebastian T.

8/4/2019,"Goleta, CA",This was my wife and my favorite restaurant  we are local residents and have been coming here for a long time even before it was called brophy's ( John Dory). We honestly try to avoid this place during tourist season. But decided to bring our kids and grandkids to avoid the fiesta stuff going on. We waited less than an hour ( not bad for a table of six) we took the kids downstairs and had a couple drinks which is another reason we love this place anyhow got seated ordered an appetizer ( fried bay scallops) my personal favorite. The waitress was nice and professional. Took a while for her to come back to take our food order ( pretty sure we had to flag her down). Anyhow placed a simple order two fish and chips a fish sandwich seafood pasta and sea bass and one order of four oysters on the half shell ( the beginning of the fall) or waitress came by after about a half hour asked if we needed anything more to drink. We asked about our food she said the bar is super busy ( this is where they prep the oysters) My son in law told the waitress don't let the oysters hold up our meal just bring them when they are ready. Table next to us who got sea tested after us are now half way through their meal. Another 20 or more minutes goes by I see our food is up ready to pick up. The waitress hasn't come to see how we are doing. ( anyone ever try to keep a five year old and a three year old quiet and happy for forty minutes sitting at a restaurant). I'm just saying. Waitress brings our food. We talked to waitress nicely wondering what the problem was. She rudely responds WE ARE VERY BUSY. We let her know we are locals have been coming for years had seen this place way busier than this. She walked away never saw her again. Manager started coming by. We talked to her about our displeasure she tried to tell us the busy thing. I cut her short and explained how many times we had been there seen it way busier. We watched the bartenders goofing around mostly taking care of the patrons at the bar. We didn't blame the waitress other than not telling the bar to do their job and get these four stupid raw oysters ready. The manager comped is a fish and chips and something else. ( patronized us ). Tried to apologize which was nice until we saw her at the register with our waitress laughing about the situation. I will say the food is great here the ambience is great. Hoping this is a one time thing. But very disappointed in how we were treated. Be aware maybe order oysters if you only sit at the bar or try somewhere else. I feel like brophy's can care less that we were disappointed so bummed.,2 star rating,Craig L.

3/19/2016,"Sylmar, CA","Went to Bropfy Bros. in Santa Barbara today looking forward to some delicious seafood and awesome Bloody Mary's as I have come to expect every time I go there. Although the appetizers and drinks were superb, as to be expected, unfortunately the  blackened sea bass was terrible much to my dismay. It was as dry as jerky. What a disappointment.However let me be very be very clear. The rest of the food  was spectacular. The bartenders made awesome drinks and the raw oysters and fried calamari was to die for.The waitress offered to bring over a manager to adjust my bill however I told her to just let me have the bill as is. I have never been one to seek a ""free meal"" or comped bill. That's just me. When I left I asked to speak to the manager in an effort to let her know so that she could speak to the chef and avoid another customer from experiencing to same gastric wreck.  She offered to ""fix"" my bill or do something to make up for the terrible meal. Again I told her that I didn't want that and that I appreciated her attempt to rectify the matter however I brought it to her attention because I didn't want Brophys to develop a bad reputation for over cooked fish.Will I go back? Probably but I certainly won't have the blackened sea bass. I would also recommend anyone patronizing Brophys to steer clear of the sea bass and chose one of the other delicious entrees.Bartenders  A+Waitresses. A -Ambiance.

As expected they gave us a table beeper and said wait would be about 45 minutes. It was almost sunset so we took a walk down the pier to check out the waves, that was pretty cool.  They were very close to the time when we got our table. Service was excellent, we sat outside under a heat lamp and it was perfect weather.  It's small space so it's crowded but intimate enough for conversation.Clam chowder was awesome.  Fish and chips were really good, specially the fish,; it was crunchy on the outside but perfectly cooked in the inside, delicious!! Fries where ok but the slaw was very good.  My daughter and I also shared the pasta and although they had ran out of scallops, the shrimp where fresh and very tasty.",4 star rating,John A.

I also love going to the harbor, so the location is perfect. Although we had to wait about an hour for a table (Saturday lunch time), we didn't mind because we walked along the beach, enjoyed the view from the visitor center, and looked around the gift shop at the Maritime Museum. What we did mind was the atmosphere inside Brophy Bros (hence 4 stars, despite the amazing food). It was so loud inside that although we were sitting next to each other, we had to yell just to be heard. Also, my water cup remained empty for most of the meal, our appetizer came out at the same time as our entrees, and waiters were constantly bumping into our chairs. It wasn't their fault though, the tables are way too close together. While the food was fantastic, I will probably not come back any time soon just because I'd rather eat in a more relaxed place while hanging out by the beach.",4 star rating,Crystal S.

There is no better place than Brophy Bros. A great place to walk around and check out the beautiful Pacific Ocean and the Santa Barbara Harbor.For us this place has a great combination; a wonderful location, interest and informal inside and outside dining, a fantastic bar overlooking the harbor, excellent wait staff. Finally they have outstanding food. I am not sure their secret but we have been here many times and I think they stick to simple, reliable, well prepared dishes. Always well presented and very flavorful.My seafood pasta had large scallops and lots of shrimp. I am a big guy and I had to pack up half of my order to bring home. Just finished it for lunch before I wrote this review. Very tasty heated up the next day!So,if you are a local you already know what a great place this is. We are semi-local and get here frequently. If you are a TOURIST pay attention. This is where the LOCALS go! The prices are very reasonable and the service is always the best. Come on in and they treat you like a LOCAL. Don't visit Santa Barbara without a meal at Brophy Bros. If you don't have time for a meal, have an Oyster Shooter and a Bloody Mary.

The stair's are to the right of that bar, which we totally ""saw"" after sitting 15 minutes at the bar wondering why the yelp menu didn't really match the menu we had in our hands!..We came during a warm winter's day, January 2nd to be exact and was in utter debate of another 4 star yelp restaurant but decided to go with this for who knows what reasons. We ordered the Cold Plate Combo, the Garlic Baked Clams, The New England Chowder; which by the way I thought was  just as good or even better than San Francisco's and the seafood pasta; I probably gotten something else but I was in a food coma by then (I was hungry). We left happy, fat and probably will regret our future self when we are suffering from obesity and who knows what else that lurks in the foods of these delicious places. By the way, this review is about 8 months late, so I sure hope this place has not changed much since we left.

Our table was still not ready when we checked in after over an hour had passed, and were told it would be at least another 30 minutes. We then switched our request to first available table (outside or inside) and were finally seated inside, well after the hour estimate. FYI, it is very loud inside.The portions were generous and the prices were reasonable.

You can smell it cooking throughout the restaurant and it smells so delicious you'll want to bath in it! Well almost!

We also ordered fried calamari as an appetizer, and the ratio of batter to calamari was perfect! The clam chowder was very flavorful and not greasy, and it had a good aftertaste too unlike some others I've had (fishy and greasy). We also had an order of the crab cake plate, which came with rice and soup. Good value! I loveeeed the cioppino, which came last but was worth the wait.

BEST ""BANG FOR YOUR BUCK"" ITEM: But if you still decide to go (and don't want to be broke) though, get the Cioppino, which is a broth with A TON of seafood (including clams, mussels, shrimp and fish), and keep the free bread coming , so that you can dip the bread in your Cioppino. It's listed under ""Soup & Salads"", but it's just as filling as a main course. WHY 3 STARS?I got the Seafood Pasta; it comes with clam chowder/salad and Fries/Rice. The Seafood Pasta, which is apparently their signature item, has way too much pasta and very little seafood (the Cioppino has way more seafood and is cheaper too).

3/16/2014,"Mission Viejo, CA","Vacationing, first time here.We checked in with front desk at 5:30 and had to wait for 1 1/2 hours to be seated.  This was a busy time to come on Saturday.  Appetizer: steamed clams and calamari The steamed clams were delicious!  Just So simple and good.  Dunk your sourdough bread in that broth. Calamari was great hot but if you leave it for a little bit the breaking starts to slide off and get soft and wet.  The tartar and cocktail sauces were very good. Clam chowder bowl and salad was huge! The chowder was do delicious but I couldn't even finish the bowl.  This is a huge bowl perfect for sharing.Seafood linguini was perfect.  The pasta was cooked perfect.  There were tons of shrimp and scallops.  Fried clam strips was also very crunchy and good.  I think a touch more salt to the batter mix would have satisfied even more.Place gets packed so occasional bar people knocking into the back of your chair while you eat is the norm.",4 star rating,Mira Y.
9/3/2016,"Monterey Park, CA","Great view, good service, and fresh seafood at a decent price. Had the cold platter which was surprisingly large for $17. The fried calamari was pretty good too. The clam chowder, which is one of their famous items, was good too. Very packed with potatoes and all sorts of things. The only disappointment here were the crab cakes. Too much stuffing and not enough crab. But overall, this place lives up to the hype so make sure you go early so you can sit outside and don't have to wait for too long.",4 star rating,Brian H.

1/3/2010,"San Jose, CA","Came here for dinner; i think day time luncheon would be nice w/ the ocean view and all; night time was just cold and dark. The place is small but it has a friendly and cozy environment. Because Brophy Bros is a clam bar.. of course you have to try their clams!Appetizer: Garlic Baked Clams ($11)- comes in 6 cherry stone clams; with tons of minced garlic on top of clam w/ a small piece of bacon as garnishing..this was very delicious!  I love the garlic and the clams were meaty!My meal came w/ a cup of clam chowder: it was okay. wasnt the best clam chowder I've had, but it was definitely good for the night since it was cold. There were more potatoes than clams in my cup.Seafood Linguine  - more like shrimp and scallop linguine (those were the only two seafood ingredients in my dish). This past was okay..came w/ 3.5 scallops ( i suppose it was meant to be 4 pcs of scallops, but i got lucked out w/ a .5 scallop instead of a whole) and 6-8pcs of shrimps (i forgot)...this pasta was loaded w/ grated Parmesan cheese so it was VERY rich and heavy. The pasta was quite dry..i wish they put more white wine.  It was good, but it didnt really satisfy my taste. Grilled Mahi Mahi w/ saffron cream sauce - no saffron taste, tasted more like alfredo sauce. the mahi mahi was dry. i wouldnt order this again. Overall this place is alright. I wouldnt mind coming back here again to try their Cioppino. Seems like that's a popular dish. Or just order their hot seafood appetizer or cold seafood appetizers.",3 star rating,Cherie T.

2/26/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Went here a couple times many years ago and then several more times during my most recent trip to SB.What can I say about this place? First off, this place has amazing seafood. Though SB is known for many places with good seafood, this is one of the best. And the fact that it is way off State Street means that it is mixed with a more local crowd. Though there is not HH at this location, the pricing of most of their food is pretty reasonable.During my last trip, my favorite dishes were their calamari (as it just melts in your mouth) and their house salad with the famous garlic caesar.Some of the fish dishes can be on the pricy end, but sticking to apps and some of the cheaper entrees, we were very satisfied.One note, I remember their clam chowder being delicious, but didn't have that same experience this past time around. Don't know if it changes day to day, year to year, or if my tastebuds have changed, but I wasn't as impressed.Overall, this place has a great ambiance and overlooks the harbor and shouldn't be missed if you are in SB.",4 star rating,Ryan R.

Also a side of coleslaw.  Good flavor...unfortunately,  didn't get to it very often because the serving size was huge and, if I was going to fill up...it was going to be on crabcakes!

11/2/2013,"Whittier, CA","We were in Santa Barbara and a friend told us that we had to eat here. We looked for it with Yelp and gave it a try. Some things that are a must:1) Bloody Mary. It really is great but get it at the bar downstairs. They were better than the ones upstairs in the main restaurant.2) the clam chowder. SO GOOD! One thing to avoid:You might think a table outside with a view of the bay is a great idea. You realize quickly that it isn't so great when you realize the tiny path along the outside between the restaurant and the tables you are sitting at can be used by people waiting for their tables. So you have a tiny path that has waiters and waitresses now tinier because people are standing drinking right there. You can literally rub elbows with asses because they are right there.  There goes the romantic dinner you were hoping for. I guess locals know this. I wish I had.

5/27/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I somehow end up at Brophy Bros. whenever I'm in Santa Barbara.  Last time I was here we had a bad experience.  Oysters were not fresh, it tasted fishy and it had a little orange slime that didn't look right.  We sent it back after trying couple of them, and we were very disappointed since my hubby and I both love fresh oysters.  Their fish and chips saved the day though, and their clam chowder was ok.  We swore we would never come back, but I'm glad we gave it another try.We ended up here again since we just wanted to eat by the beach and it wasn't very crowded (only about a 10min wait).  We saw a plate of oysters passing by, and this time, it looked really fresh.  We ordered some of the oysters, clam chowder, couple oyster shooters and their hot appetizer combo that had a little bit of everything.Their oysters were soooo much better this time around, and their clam chowder was great.  I don't know if last time we came it was just their off day or not, but the experience was completely different this time around.  The standout in their hot combo was the beer steamed shrimp and steamed clams.  Excellent.  Their mussels were alright, and their oyster rockefeller and garlic baked clams were both just ok.  I guess I don't believe in smothering seafood in so much sauce and breading that you barely taste any of the seafood.Overall, so glad I gave this place another go.  Enjoying a nice outdoor meal by the beach with fresh seafood and ice cold beer is my kind of heaven, so I'm glad Brophy Bros delivered this time.  Recommend!",4 star rating,Susan S.

12/1/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Stopped by here at around 2pm on a Friday on the way to Pismo at my boyfriend's recommendation. We didn't have to wait at all at this time, but it was still pretty crowded. We couldn't decide on what to order so we ordered aloooot! But it all ended up being a perfect amount without tipping us over the edge into a food coma. My favorite were the clam steamers. I'm a huge fan of clams though so I may be biased! The calamari was great as well, it had a light breading that we both liked. We also ordered the garlic baked clams since it looked so good in fellow yelpers pictures! Thanks for the tip because these were also yummy! To finish off our meal, we shared the crab cakes entree, which came with fries, coleslaw and a cup of clam chowdaaaa! Crab cakes were AMAZING. I would definitely order this again. Even their fries were good. The clam chowder at Brophy's is full of clams so I wouldn't skip out on this either!

10/15/2015,"San Francisco, CA","The clam chowder here is seriously out of this world. Probably the best clam chowder i've ever had! It's perfectly creamy with the right ratios of clams & potatoes which is crucial if you know what I mean. Steak dinner - pretty good but i'm not sure if it was worth the price tag. The garlic butter or whatever it comes with is amazing however! We got it medium rare but it was very difficult and hard to chew. Poke salad - super good as well! The ahi was fresh and at the right temperature, the dressing it came with was also delicious and perfectly paired. I'd highly recommend this if you're going for something lighter.This place is always crowded and a bit of a high blood pressure raises when you enter, but after you're seated all the workers are generally very nice! They kind of forgot our order of oysters, luckily we were too full from the other items we ordered. Next time, I definitely want to try the hot combo!Cocktail wise - I would not recommend the mai tai. It was overly sweet, yet very strong. Sadly, At least they didn't jip you on the alcohol, but it was not a good balance of flavors and I wasn't even able to finish it.

They go the more classic route, incorporating oyster juice and horseradish for a very tasty kick! The calamari plate was filling and at a reasonable price. My friend was not too fond of the seafood pasta due to its pungent sauce, although the scallops were amazingly tender and flavorful!

It has 2 floors; the bottom floor is the bar and upstairs is the restaurant. We waited about 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. We were able to order food on the side of the bar area while we waited for our seat. My BF ordered an oyster shooter. He says it was really fresh but too much Tabasco sauce(little on the spicy side) but very good. We ordered a bowl of their clam chowder. Gave us free sourdough bread and butter. The bread was so soft that I just kept eating and eating and ended up eating all the bread! I love bread! Clam chowder was out of this world! So creamy and every bite has potato and clams! Very tasty! But towards the end, I found a piece of hair...ewww. The staff apologizes and gave us a free cup of chowder. All the staff is very friendly and they all seem happy to work there with their smiles on. We finally got seated and ordered the fish and chips with a side of salad instead of fries. WOW! First bite into the fish, it was heaven! It was literally that good! Something about the batter taste very good. I think it was the beer. Comes with cole slaw on the side.

They don't take reservations here but Yelp convinced us to try this place out. The wait isn't too long, about 30minutes and you are able to enjoy the bar downstairs. The waitress was friendly as were the hosts. Three stars only because the food hype seemed to be all about the fish and chips and they were good, but a little soggy which took away our appetite and the fries were plain. I ordered the sea bass and while being a plain fish, they made it pretty good, but it was best when dunked in the butter sauce provided. The clam chowder on the other hand I got with my entree as an option and was amazing! Seriously up there with the best ever! The oyster shooters were good too, it is spicy so beware, but I loved it!

Boy is it a tight squeeze between the tables and the bar with elbows everywhere. Once seated our waitress came quickly. We ordered 2 Arnold Palmer's and 2 cups of clam chowder to start. The clam chowder was great! In fact I've been wanting some more all weekend. For our dinner we both ordered fish and chips. It tasted fresh and not heavy!

Given how busy he appeared to be, we were impressed by this gesture. He continued to smile throughout the evening despite the fact that he appeared overwhelmed. Food was top notch, service was prompt, his menu suggestions were on point. The steamed clams were heaven, and so fresh!  The Cajun sea bass was to die for, perfectly cooked, pleasantly seasoned. To top it off, his suggestions on wine pairings were superb. We couldn't  have asked for a more delightful dining experience. We now understand why Brophy Brothers is considered an ""institution"". Thanks for making our birthday  celebration so special.Can't wait to come back next year.",5 star rating,Zoe B.
5/4/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Stopped by for a light quick meal on the way home from Solvang.. It was a little hard to find considering that the back of the restaurant was undergoing construction when I went.. but it was all cool and dandy when I found it. The place looks like any other seafood joint that you'll find by the pier. Inside seating as well as outside around the perimeter of the restaurant on the second floor.. (the first floor I think is more fast food style? I'm not sure.. they weren't open yet when I went)  Very open and a great view of all the boats in that little harbor. Since I was going for a light meal I ordered the...Clam Chowder .. yelp.com/biz_photos/brop…HOLY SMOKES.. mouthful of clams in every spoonful. No joke. Even though its clam chowder, you won't get that overly heavy creaminess. The star of the chowder is in fact the clams and not the potato like a lot of places. Must try!Fresh Oysters.. yelp.com/biz_photos/brop…If only the oysters shells were cleaned better before serving. It was almost as if the oysters were just lightly rinsed over water before cracking open because there were a ton of concentrated black dirt that got all over my hands when I was trying to enjoy my oysters effortlessly. Don't get me wrong.. the oysters were deliciously fresh. Just got annoyed of constantly have to wipe my hands after touching the oysters.Fish and Chip... yelp.com/biz_photos/brop…One of their recommended dishes.. and after trying it.. I recommend it as well! When it comes to battered fried fish I am quite skeptical since there is nothing I hate more about food than over battered fried food. (fair food anyone?) But Brophy Bro does it right. The batter is so light its almost tempura like, but its not! I bet you this is one way to get kids to eat fish!Definitely stopping by again next time i'm in SB bro~",4 star rating,Jessica C.
7/6/2008,"East Bay, CA","Who knew that even on July 4th we were able to get a table for four right away?  How awesome is that!  The hostess informed me that there was only a wait to sit outside.  People probably wanted to so that they could watch fireworks while they eat.  On crazy holidays like this, the maximum time for dinner is 2 hours and fireworks start at 9:30pm so plan wisely.Combination Appetizer Platter (Hot) - Beer boiled shrimp, garlic baked clams, oysters, steamed mussels, steamed clams.  This was the perfect appetizer since we had a pregnant person with in our group.  Everything is cooked and safe to eat.  My favorite was the garlic baked clams which was so creamy!  For serious garlic lovers only.  There's some broth that the seafood is cooked in that you can also dip your bread in!  Be careful because you can definitely tell us the ""shell"" in the broth so you better like seafood to drink this.  There's also a ""cold"" combination appetizer platter which has the raw stuff.  Oysters on half shell - Yummy as usual.  Comes with lemon and a cocktail sauce.  There were some big pieces and some little.  Good size and variety for $8.50.Fish 'n Chips - FAVORITE dish of the night.  Does anyone know what type of fish they use?  This was probably one of the best fish 'n chips dishes I've ever had.  The fish was so fresh and flakey.  It almost melted in my mouth.  It was lightly battered and not too oily.  I'm indifferent about fries because it's just a filler in your belly but the coleslaw was plentiful and offset the heaviness of the fish.Clam Chowder - Very chunky and full of potatoes and fresh clams.  The cup is so filled that there's no room for any oyster crackers.  You probably don't need to add them anyway since it'll absorb up more soup and the soup barely has any liquid to begin with!All the food we ordered was from the Clam Bar Menu (for us po' folks) but I would definitely like to come back and order from the Fresh Fish Menu ($20+ plates) when I'm not po' no mo.  Thanks Rachel Ray for telling us about this place.",4 star rating,Shannon L.

You will have to wait for a table, but I usually always slip into a spot at the bar! I would have given 5 stars, but both my mom in law and I had the salmon entree last time - fish was overcooked and an odd bright pink (not like normal salmon, almost looked dyed), fries were cold.

11/18/2018,"San Francisco, CA","This place was recommended by a friend, so I had high hopes. I'm always a bit skeptical when it comes to a restaurants by the water - only because the high ratings usually come from the views and not the food. We came for a late Saturday lunch and the place was quite packed, but we didn't have to wait. I ordered the seabass entree which came with cole slaw, a choice of salad or clam chowder and a choice of french fries or rice pilaf. I opted for the salad and french friends. My boyfriend ordered the hot combo, which came with 2 baked oysters, 2 baked calms and some mussels, clams and shrimp in a white wine sauce. Everything was just way too bland. The shrimp were tiny and they served us 4 dead mussels! The fish was a bit overcooked and tasted a tad burnt. On top of the food being mediocre, our server was always no where to be found and never refilled our water cups. This place was definitely a let down.",3 star rating,Sasha Y.
6/29/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Cannot come here without getting GBCs. (Garlic baked clams) that's the main draw! Don't think that you can share them either, get one order per person. Why? Because they are that good. All the other lunch stuff is decent, but generally I'm disappointed when I order an entree. They are always packed and I think the cook could be more attentive when cooking fish. Got sea bass that was over cooked on one side. Usually I start with the amazingly good sourdough bread, GBCs, clam chowder. Several glasses of wine for me, a few beers for my boy, and this place with an amazing view is the win! If it's too busy I just walk up to the bar window and order for a quick bite.",5 star rating,Victoria M.
11/17/2018,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I normally love this place, but tonight my Sea Bass was not thoroughly cooked and they had to take it back to finish. I didn't notice it was under cooked until after a few bites and then I told our server. She completely agreed so that part was not a problem. I was just surprised that they took the fish off my plate and back to the kitchen to cook further instead of taking my entire plate. Having the rest of my food and my utensils on the plate with under cooked fish made me nervous. I also was surprised that they didn't offer some sort of complimentary food or price break. When the Sea Bass was returned to me it was over cooked. Not horrible but enough that it was somewhat dry and tough. I will probably never return to Brophy's after this experience. I also sampled the clam chowder and it was very salty. I think this restaurant has gone downhill. Too bad. It used to be a great restaurant known for their freshness.",2 star rating,Michael F.

It really tasted bland and not a lot of taste or flavor! That dish cost almost $20 with a side of clam chowder. I tried it with a rice pilaf dish as part of the side dish and same thing...it had no flavor or taste!The calamari was okay and my husband said the beer battered fish and chips was okay too.I was however, really disappointed in the service!

7/19/2015,"Bloomington, IN","Very good. But not great -- got some downsides. The good: beautiful view over the harbor, friendly servers, pretty fast service (esp. considering the crowding), and all the food we had (shrimp & crab salad, fish 'n' chips, pasta with butter, and mahi mahi) was mostly very good. The fish 'n' chips were hot and crisp right from the fryer, the mahi mahi portion was big and moist. But it wasn't great. We've had better seafood any number of places. It was all on the plain side. The bad: the cole slaw had the blandest dressing ever; pretty much tasted like wet cabbage. The place isn't large but attracts a lot of customers, so it's crowded -- you're squished onto small tables if you're a family -- and very noisy. The first time we went they said the wait was 90 minutes, so we left while a guy waiting shouted ""It's worth it!"" We came back earlier the next day and got seated right away, but by the end I was sure the guy was wrong: not worth a 90 minute wait, but OK for 20.",3 star rating,Jeremy A.

The clam chowder was definitely the greatest way to start off the meal. If was tasty and you get a spoon full of clams every spoon. And that pretty much set the mood for the rest of the meal. Fish and chips had a nice batter made it crispy on the outside and warm and flaky in the inside. Seafood pasta had a nice creamy sauce that wasn't too creamy and loaded with fresh seafood.The Hot Combo plate came with stuffed clams, stuffed oysters, and boiled mussels, clams, and shrimp.

Our food did come out super fast, so we felt like they had made a mistake order and just fried a fresh batch of fish and dumped it in with the nasty stale fries. My boyfriend didn't want to ask for new fries, so I didn't ask them for a new batch of fries, but seriously, the fries were stale and cold.

2/23/2015,"San Marino, CA","Came here this past Sunday around 2pm, and there was still a 30 minute wait!  Crazy.  Other than the wait, the food and service was great.  The waitresses and bus boys try to zip through the narrow aisles, so sometimes it's hard to get their attention when they're moving so fast!  This place has limited seating for the outside, so if you want to wait for a table with a view, the wait will definitely be at least 45+ minutes.  While you're waiting, there is a pier where you can walk down to to gaze at the ocean and take a look at the boats and yachts that are parked by the pier.  Whenever I come to Santa Barbara, I have to make a stop at Brophy Bro's and I have to get the clam chowder bowl.  It's a must.  Especially since they give you sourdough bread for you in the beginning!  Mmm, the sourdough bread dipped in the clam chowder so delicious.  Reminds me of Disneyland, except this claim chowder bowl is 10000x better.  I have never been too fond of their entrees, and really just come here for the appetizers.  I recently had the Cold Combo ($15.95), which comes with 2 raw oysters, 3 raw claims, crab meat, and ceviche.  The raw oysters, claims and crab meat were the best part.  The ceviche...not so much. I think it's because the fish that they use in the ceviche is not fresh.  The other items are fresh though.",4 star rating,Stacey C.

Brophy's is bustling with happy customers and young attractive help. The menu sticks to fresh shellfish and fish, prepared simply and well. The muscles were the biggest I have seen, perfectly steamed and came with an extra cup of sauce to dip the sourdough. Yum. The crab and shrimp salad was topped with what looked like a whole avocado. We waited 30 minutes at lunch and it was worth it.",5 star rating,Johanna C.
4/15/2013,"Redondo Beach, CA","After a few drinks and Fried Calamari at the Clam Bar downstairs, our buzzer went off after 45 minutes on a late Saturday night. This spot is right on the marina, sailboats and lights reflecting on the windows and water. It was beautiful and very romantic. After gazing at the nautical decor and the open windows to the balcony, we ordered up! A cup of clam chowder with fresh clams and thick soup base, served in a coffee mug - YUM. It was an easy choice for me, the Hot Combo - boiled peel & eat shrimp, mussels and clams in a garlic/butter/white wine broth, two oysters rockefeller and two baked clams on the side. Half of a lemon ready for spritzing and I dug in!Date had the fish & chips, came with coleslaw too. A bread basket danced on the table, making its way into the broth of the hot combo drizzled with a little butter every few dips. House white wine was my choice for the night, and our server, Dana, even comped my glass with dinner for my birthday (since they don't serve dessert!). Hands down, one of the best seafood dinners I've had and worth the wait.",5 star rating,Alexis C.

4/8/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Besides the clam chowder, the dishes that my girlfriend and I ordered looked better than they actually tasted. Maybe starting off with the clam chowder set the bar too high? I'm not sure. I had the seafood pasta and my girlfriend had the mahi mahi. We shared and both of us were in agreement that the main entrees were a little disappointing. It's hard to describe exactly why they were disappointing, since it's subjective but my dish was a little insipid. Maybe I was thinking that they would have used more garlic and basil? However, we wouldn't hesitate to come here again to get that clam chowder and eat by the water.Update: After I wrote this review I received a message from the owner voicing his concern about my experience and apologizing. I'm upgrading my rating a star because I can tell they will look to do their best to make sure the dining experience and food is the best they can get it. Next time I'm up in Santa Barbara, I'm definitely making another visit there because their clam chowder was sooooo good and I'm believing their food will now follow suit.",4 star rating,Rich O.

They don't have a kids section on the menu, but when we asked the waitress she gave us a couple of kids dishes that they make, but aren't listed. I would say my only dislike about the place was really the lack of options for those that don't eat seafood. But overall my family and o had an awesome experience.",4 star rating,Maryann R.

It's basically a (awesome, 2 story) seafood shack on the pier.since i wasn't really there to eat or wait for a table, i simply walked around to the outdoor balcony and stood at the bar and had a drink. Seats at the bar were all taken on my visit, I assume that if you arrive at a decent time (either early or late), you might actually get a table on the narrow outdoor balcony. when leaving i noticed a little (almost secret) downstairs room - if you don't mind being away from the action up above on the pier (where the actual restaurant is located), it looked like first come first served downstairs.Bartender was really nice and was cracking jokes and the lovely hosts gave me all the info on the outside standing bar - GREAT STAFF!!

The patio opens a beautiful view over the marina but the seating layout is very narrow. Sitting inside was no option since seating was even tighter; plus it was noisy and sticky.The food was compare to Ventura disappointing. Although my sandwich came with a large piece of fresh grilled fish, the raw thick sliced onion, lonely salad leave and tiny tomato weren't what I expected.

We visited at night, so the visibility wasnt as nice as during the day IMO, but the lights were a nice enough view. This place is BUSY, as many other reviewers have noted, so be prepared to wait. I recommend waiting with the adult beverage of your choice at the bar downstairs :) Sadly, my procrastination in writing reviews means that I cannot quite remember everything I ordered, but I do remember it was pretty good. I love clam chowder and  they have some very good clam chowder, that I remember. The service (once you actually get in) was very good. I of course, can't remember the waitress' name but she was very attentive and sweet. The outdoor seating is a bit restrictive...tight if you will. I was worried about hitting the people sitting at the table behind us when I was (trying) to slide gracefully into my seat. There's not a lot of space, so if you are bothered by that (as I tend to be) maybe sit inside. I think it's worth a stop to take a meal here if you're passing thru.",4 star rating,Erayna T.

One of my top places to bring guests is Brophy Bros.  It's a perfect stop for a late afternoon lunch as the view from the deck is majestic.  It may sound crazy to say if you can't sit at the bar don't worry because I think it is much better to stand at the open window to the bar. You can do this and if you see a long line of people waiting to eat at Brophy's just go hang outside the bar window and place your order. The bartenders will take excellent care of you and you will get to see everything - the bartenders cutting open oysters, the mountains, the ocean, the boats - its just perfect.  Oh and the food is worth standing up for.  We usually share an order of fish and chips - its so large and just the right amount to share while enjoying a glass or wine or drink.",5 star rating,Allison P.

8/17/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Great views. Great Breeze. and Great Chowder. One of Santa Barbara's finest! My local tour guide ended our day here, at Brophy. A small restaurant, packed with movement and conversations. Incredibly busy, but got a seat in a short few minutes. I liked their seafood, fresh enough, and I liked their prices for their seafood more! So reasonable for the portions and the atmosphere. We scarfed down Oysters, Hot Mix Plate, Fish and Chips, Steamed Clams, and CHOWDAAA. All the seafood plates would be as you expect them. White wine, garlic, salt. Simple! Balanced. I wish the seafood was a little bigger, but that could have just been the catch / season. Mussels seemed underwhelming, and clams were shriveled. Everything else was fair though. Fish and chips held up well. Batter stayed crunchy and lightly seasoned, and the cod was untampered, keeping it to its natural flavors and fatty fluff. Now to the Chowdaaa. I am biased. I will say it. One of the best Clam Chowders in the lower west coast is Splash Café (Pismo), but I will admit that Brophy's clam chowder is definitely neck and neck. Right amount of thickness (where it doesn't taste like starch), right amount of clam to potato ratio, right amount of seasoning (not incredibly salty to hide the ""fishiness"" of clam chowda). Sat inside with a summer breeze blowing in my face, while sounds of the water and people filled the air, I must say, this was a great way to end the day.",4 star rating,Ben S.

9/18/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Haven't been back for years... although when I'm in town, I'd go here for my favorite clam chowder.When we arrived on Sunday 6pm, our party of 2 was told to wait 30 mins, so I told them we didn't mind if it's outdoors or indoors. The device they gave us never buzzed and as we returned to the restaurant after 45 mins, the waitress said ""oh you have 2 tables ahead of us, but there's a table indoors if you wanna take it"". Hmmmm I specifically said that we are cool with both indoors and outdoors twice when she asked... (yes, the same person, and it was her who asked)! Thank goodness it's the only hiccup of the night.Food was dainty as usual. To my delight, clam chowder still stands to be my favorite after all these years of clam chowder hunting in America and Asia. Loved the Garlic Baked Clams (GBCs). The soup in Cioppino was tasty, clams and mussels are cooked just right, although I personally prefer the fish to be slightly more flavorful. Was skeptical about the Sea Bass at first (Sea Bass x cajun spices?) -- still good but could be more succulent. Fries and coleslaws were delicious (can't go wrong with fries, but some coleslaws could just ruin your appetite within seconds). Bread and butter was delish, so was the Bloody Mary! All servers are attentive, efficient, and polite. Brought back home with satisfied stomachs. Would come back for clam chowder and GBCs! Down to try other dishes next time.",4 star rating,Stephanie A.

12/18/2014,"Spotsylvania County, VA","This was my first time visiting Brophy's Bros.  I know they have another restaurant in Oxnard as well, but my comments are specifically to the Santa Barbara restaurant.Food was five star along with five star service.  I had the calamari, lobster soup, and shrimp scampi.  We shared the calamari and found it was perfectly fried.  It wasn't tough or chewy and it was served hot.  The lobster soup was exceptional and served very hot as well.  They have a good reputation for the bisque and I highly recommend it.  However, unless you want a lot, go with the cup.  My dining partner had the bowl and it was more than he could eat.  My shrimp were the best.  They were large and very tender, not chewy.  I paired it with the house chardonnay and found the wine the perfect match.  My bill was $30.Service was very attentive and friendly and I've give them five stars as well.  Water glasses were always full and table was kept clear of plates/dishes as we were finished with them.  Service time was also very good.  Our appetizers came out within a reasonable time and the soup and entrees followed shortly thereafter.We set outside the upstairs floor.  They had some heaters that took away the chill and we enjoyed our conversation overlooking the marina.In summary, I would definitely go there again when I'm in Santa Barbara.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality fish restaurant.",5 star rating,Dudley W.
5/13/2013,"Ventura, CA","Went on a mini vacay in Santa Barbara. Came from LA, drove to Solvang Village had wine tastings and then we finally decided we were hungry.We had quite an adventure looking for the place haha we finally saw the sign and entered the flight of stairs. It was a weekend night, the place was packed the hostess informed us that it was an hour wait for a table of two people. I was hesitant at first because I was really hungry already. But figured I can hold off. So we walked by the beach we were pretty far off so I mildy worrying that the thing might be ringing already and we might lose our spot. Nope.1:15, still no call. 1:30, no call, at this point I was just cranky and looking for places to eat without the wait. 1:48 the thing was buzzing. We hurried upstairs, however the it was packed full of people trying to get on the list. It was another challenge squeezing into people in the stairway lol. Hostess said she only had outside seating, and I just wanted to be seated and eat already. So okayWe got seated, we had a nice view of the beach and fishermen unloading their cargo full of fresh fish and uni. It was windy and cold that night but I didn't mind.Like most people say, the clam chowder here is just yummy, i was creamy and flavorful the clams were fresh. I'm in for a second serving if I had space. I ordered the linguine shrimp and scallop pasta, not normally a fan of white pasta (and a big pasta girl) but this one was just perfect. It was light and the sauce complimented the seafood well. OYSTERS! Their oysters are as fresh as it gets!However being seated outside near their bar has its CONS. At one point at the middle of our dinner date there was a group ""enjoying their drinks and having a talk"" the walkway between the bar and tables was narrow. So narrow that  this guy was almost sitting at our table. Take note while we were having a supposedly ""romantic"" dinner. I wanted to push him off to be perfectly honest. It was just yuck. I really don't mind food prices. But for the price we paid, I would expect to be seated at the time frame you gave me or sooner. And a stragers bottom off my table.",3 star rating,Jara Neriza M.

10/18/2012,"Omaha, NE","I've been traveling to to Santa Barbara since I was a kid and have eaten at Brophy Bros for years...long before the days of yelp's awesomeness! I haven't been back here for a while so I knew I had to yelp it straightaway. I love the warf area and even waited a while for a table outside. I had forgotten about the heat lamps outside, which were a nice touch for the somewhat chilly October breeze coming off the ocean. There's also something special about eating fresh seafood and looking at the water it came from. The shark sandwich I ordered was so fresh and meaty...just what I wanted. I asked for it blackened and the spices weren't too overwhelming. Just right. My sandwich also came with a heap of golden fries and an abundance of creamy, refreshing coleslaw. Our service was excellent. The waiter took care of everything, was knowledgable about the menu, and had a great attitude. He had personality but it wasn't over the top like some servers feel they need to be. Easy going but attentive. If I could change one thing about this place, and go back in time, I'd want the outside searching area to be about a foot wider. It wasn't a big problem, and the existing structure is not something you'd want to mess with, but if you're claustrophobic it might give you anxiety.",4 star rating,Natalie E.

The drinks are STRONG. If you're looking to casually drink a Bloody Mary, as I was looking to do, this may not be the place. Oysters were fresh, as was everything, really. I kind of wanted the oysters to be slightly more salty, but I'm not sure that's something they can control or anything. Food came fast, even though the place was packed.

11/27/2012,"Torrance, CA",Brophy Bros is a nice seafood restaurant right by the beach. This place is always pretty packed with seafood fanatics like me! It's a seafood restaurant by the beach that serves fresh seafood so obviously the price is steep.My boyfriend and I always ordered fresh oysters on half shell and some entree. I've ordered the salmon and scampi and they were both great. Nothing spectacular but it was seasoned well and I had nothing to complain about. I enjoyed my entree thoroughly and you can only imagine how fast I consumed them oysters.

The hot boil sampler's mussels, clams, shrimp and baked oysters were cooked perfectly. We only got a cup of the clam chowder, but it was so hearty and chunky we wished we got a bowl. Their famous fish and chips exceeded our expectations. The fish wasn't heavily breaded and the meat was so soft. They were big pieces too! Try to get the upstairs outdoor seating if you can!

8/16/2014,"Rosemead, CA","To me, $41 is a big deal. Being a college student, frugality is SO CRUCIAL. Too bad I have a love for food. It leaves me broke every month. So when I do spend $40, I want to know it's money well spent on delicious food.This is not it. $15 for a hot appetizer sampler plate, $10 for fish and chips, and $7 for clam chowder. Taken at face value, these prices aren't that bad. However, when you add under par food with that price, it becomes unbearably painful for your wallet. You start to wonder why you didn't use that $40 for 30 delicious street tacos.. or a all you can eat korean bbq dinner for two.. for 20 in and out burgers.For the sampler plate, the garlic baked clams had a 3:1 ratio of bread crumbs to clam meat, same goes for the baked oysters, the steamed clams were over cooked and super tough, and the mussels were the size of my upper pinky joint. The fish and chips only came with 3 strips of fish. And the clam chowder was ""eh"". It wasn't dream inducing worthy. I'm sorry. :( This breaks my heart as much as it does yours, Brophy.",2 star rating,Betty W.

Super friendly and accommodating.Now onto the food...- Clam chowder: Worth the hype! They definitely don't skimp out on the potatoes and clam.- Oyster shooters: Can't judge how these were since it was my first time taking them, but they were spicier than I was expecting.- Garlic baked clams (GBCs): Really good and full of flavor!- Fried calamari: Lightly breaded, quality squid, pretty delish.- Ahi poke salad: Loved it! The dressing was light and complimented the poke wonderfully. - Seafood pasta: Yummmm...even the leftovers tasted amazing. I'd recommend sharing any of the big plates. Soup, side, and main dish are a lot to handle especially after sharing appetizers.- Crab cakes: The first few bites were good but they were a little too rich and thick for my liking.- Ahi tuna: It was a fat piece of fish but I wasn't a fan of the breading.

Since there were two parts to this restaurant, I was under the impression there was a casual and fancier versions of the restaurant. The wait was extremely long, so I figured two things: (1) This place must be that bomb (2) it's so fancy we should've made reservations....hmph. It is busy because the size of the actual restaurant is small! While waiting my cousins and I each got a bowl of the clam chowder downstairs. Then after the long wait, we went upstairs to be seated. I shared the Calamari and fries with my cousin. YES the calamari was super duper fresh....but there wasn't anything WOW about it. I also had an oyster shooter which was pretty fresh!

The fish is the freshest in town. Babes had Cajun Sea bass, great. I had ahi, it was swimming that morning. The wait is painfully long. We tried to get in on two different days. We made it , then I found out that babes insisted on outdoor balcony table, so that accounted for some wait. Our waiter was young son of owner , they need to give him a big bonus as he reps the family honor well. Must go in Santa Barbara",4 star rating,Mike M.

We arrived at noon and only waited 10ish minutes for an outdoor table. Right on the water. Beautiful.ALOT to choose from on the menu. BF got fish stew. I got shrimp/crab salad. There were olives and eggs (which were not on the menu and which I really do not like) Had it taken off. The waiter was really sweet and made me feel really comfortable about the change. One of the best meals of my life. Crab and shrimp were fresh and DELISH. Lettuce and veggies, extra delish.

7/1/2016,"Santa Clara, CA","Terrible food. My least favorite was the blackened sea bass. What a terrible way to treat a sea bass. Another fail was the cole slaw. I've never tasted any cole slaw so gross. Their clam chowder was quite salty, strange textured and served in a strange tea cup. I ordered the salmon which was boring and not very tasty--and so with the rice pilaf that comes with it. However, one highlight of the meal was my mom's seafood pasta. The scallop and shrimp was ok, but the sauce was rich and delicious. This restaurant is probably only worth eating at if you have a table on the patio. Otherwise, the food is NOT worth it. Beer and wine selection was also limited (no tap beers and house wine was so-so).",1 star rating,Grace S.
5/18/2014,"Camp Hill, PA","Over crowded tourist trap with sub par sea food.  The only bonus is the amazing view.  The clam chowder is only slightly better than Campbell's canned variety and the famous Bloody Mary tasted like tomato juice had been replaced by cocktail sauce with no advantage in taste.  The crab cakes were burnt and the fish and chips are literally no different from any other I've ever had.  To be honest, the real big let down other the long wait is the amount of hype the restaurant did not live up to.  Strangely everyone recommended highly food that in essence is okay and in my opinion somewhat reasonably priced.  The local clientele should probably experience better seafood prior to raving about alright seafood.-Ari Huber",2 star rating,Rebecca R.

2/16/2015,"Oakland, CA","The wait was pretty long, as most other reviewers have noted. Fortunately, we were new to the area and spent the time exploring. There's a maritime museum next door. After an hour passed, we returned, and were next in line. While the weather was around 65F and not too windy, we chose to sit inside.The server brought us bread right away; this was particularly empathic, as we had been waiting a long time and were getting weak from lack of carbs.Crab cakes were excellent - lots of crab. Hot combo platter seafood was fresh, delicious. Fish and chips - most notably, the breading on the fish was not overly oily (not too filling) and not too crispy.Minuses: they brought us our appetizer, the hot combo, just seconds after we got our 2 main entrees. It would have been nicer to have that before the mains. When they brought the food all at the same time, the amount of food was just overwhelming.",4 star rating,Gerald C.
1/25/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","This is a semi-cute but semi-touristy place to venture out to in SB for seafood.  I came last weekend with two friends for lunch.  Luckily we were seated right away despite the fact that the restaurant was super busy with lots of families.  It's not the biggest space, so it might feel a bit cramped.We ordered quite a bit and shared it all:  clam chowder, half dozen oysters, and a calamari plate (comes with coleslaw and french fries).The clam chowder was a bit too salty for my tastes, although I liked the fact that there were fresh clams in the soup.  What was nice was that the restaurant gave us some house bread, so we were able to dip it to mitigate the saltiness.  The half dozen oysters were standard.  It's not the kind of place where you get to pick which kinds of oysters, so I guess they give you whatever they have in stock.My favorite of what we sampled was the calamari plate!  The calamari did not taste frozen at all - instead, it was fresh and soft, and the buttermilk batter offered a nice crispy but not overly crunchy coating.  I could eat this stuff all day conditions permitting.  The fries were fine, and my friend remarked that the coleslaw was a bit too dressy.Service:  They're working them like horses here!  They are fast, efficient, and still manage to deliver service with some niceness and a smile.Bottom line:  Fried calamari FTW!  Everything else is a bit average.",3 star rating,Denny C.

10/7/2014,"San Francisco, CA","I'm so happy I found this place as I was randomly searching places to have lunch in SB during a weekend getaway. The day was beautiful as it seemed grim the day before with the rain, but the sun decided to come out and play! Which played up this place and its great scenery. We came here around 2:30pm for a late lunch and it was pretty packed in the main restaurant upstairs. But we didn't have to wait too long, which was a plus. Got seated out on the deck, which was covered I'm guessing because it had been raining the previous days so our view of the ocean and harbor was through plastic.The food was really good. We got the clam chowder which was amazing! It was not watery, too salty, or too fishy, had chunks of clams and potatoes. It was absolutely delish! We also go the oysters on the half shell and they were wonderful... I did have a few shells in mine, but other than that they were tasty. I ordered the fresh fish sandwich and the boy order the tilapia entree which came with the cup of chowder. The tilapia was super yummy... it was well seasoned, moist, and perfectly cooked. My fresh fish sandwich was... ummm fresh? It was under-seasoned... actually I don't think they put any seasoning on it, it just tasted grilled. I had to put some salt and a lot of tartar sauce on it. I was a little disappointed. On the plus side their cole slaw is pretty good. I'm not a fan, but the cole slaw here was really lightly dressed but still flavorful and I don't know, it was just plain noms.If we ever come back here I will def NOT be getting the fresh fish sandwich, maybe a whole bowl instead of the cup of soup. They have a combo deal where you can order the soup with a salad. I might go with that next time.This is a for sure go to spot :)",4 star rating,Michelle M.

7/18/2012,"New York, NY","Made an overnight trip to Santa Barbara during my west coast visit back in April, located this place based on the good reviews & the fact that it was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel. There was about a 20-30 minutes wait. We got a round of drinks at the bar upstairs & ordered and appetizer but ended up getting a table sooner than estimated, which was fine as we were hungry. The place was packed so we were generally happy with the decision to eat here. The staff was very friendly & the service was efficient. We tried the beer boiled shrimp for appetizer, had a good flavor to it, shrimp  have the shell/skin on. We got their house cesar salads which were really fresh & the dressing had a bit of a kick to it. Two of us decide to go with their Seabass dusted with Cajun spices- served with a rice pilaf & coleslaw. I have to say it was one of THE BEST Seabass I've had. The Cajun seasoning added so much flavor. One of my friends ordered the crab cakes (served with fries & coleslaw) and those were really yummy too.

10/18/2014,"Atlanta, GA","This is a pretty cool place on the Santa Barbara Harbor. First, it's super bustling, even on a Thursday night in the fall when we stopped in. We had to wait about 30 minutes, which we spent at the bar downstairs. We grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar there, which were average. For some reason, the drinks were a bit watery. That is, they were large in volume and not that flavorful or alcoholic.After getting called by the hostess, we moved to a table on the outside of the restaurant upstairs. It was really bustling upstairs, where there was another bar. Our table was along the harbor side of the restaurant and had a nice view. It was a good table, and would have been great, but we were immediately adjacent to the bar where some people were standing with their backs to us. Plus, this patio is a little bit narrow and there were constantly people walking by. It was hard to enjoy the romantic venue with all the noise and bustle.That said, there was delicious food. We started out with delicious bread and then had some great entrees. My wife had the seafood pasta, and I had blackened fish. Both were excellent. Well prepared and flavorful. I bet all the items on the menu are good. We didn't get dessert because we were super full.Overall, I think this is a pretty cool place to have dinner. If it were a little quieter, I think it would be 5 stars, but I guess that's just the atmosphere of the restaurant. Just keep that in mind if you go.",4 star rating,Brent W.

5/26/2016,"San Jose, CA","Brophy's is on the harbor. This place is packed. Put your name on the list and have drinks in the downstairs bar. The outside dining area has nice views of the harbor. The tables are bolted down so it can get cramped trying to get into your seat if it is crowded. Had calamari appetizer, oysters and ceviche appetizer. For dinner, had the cioppino, seafood pasta and the scampi. The calamari is good and too heavily breaded. Its a small portion with no tentacles. The oysters were the best deal. They were big and fresh served with cocktail sauce and lemon. The ceviche was citrusy but needed more fish and less tomatoes. The scampi and seafood pasta comes with chowder or soup. The scampi comes with either fries or rice. The chowder was thick and good with lots of clams. The pasta and scampi were garlicky with lots of butter. The cioppino broth was flavorful with plenty of fish but no crab. Ask for bread to soak up the broth.  Too bad they don't offer dessert",4 star rating,Bacon G.

We decided to sit in the bar which offers limited food options and ate fish and chips. The fried fish with the two sauces (mayo and tomato/salsa based) were so good.

4/14/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","My review is for their downstairs bar area, and not for the upstairs with the full menu.My fiancee and I were looking for a tasty spot at the harbor to enjoy a meal, and had never been to Brophy Bros. before. We went upstairs, but the wait time was an hour, and we were pretty hungry, so we checked out the downstair bar option. The menu is very limited down there, and seating is a bit tight. We were able to find a seat, and quickly ordered a couple margaritas, they were alright, but nothing spectacular. I ordered the fish and chips, and my fiancee just ordered clam chowder because he was already in a grumpy sort of mood due to the limited menu. The food came pretty quickly, and I was really disappointed by my fish and chips, they just weren't good at all. They do make great french fries, but that was about all I liked on my plate. The clam chowder was really yummy though. My fiancee asked the waitress for some bread to go with the clam chowder and she provided us an uncut loaf of the coldest, most stale bread I have ever munched. Pretty disappointing. We did not stay for more than one drink, and left most of our food uneaten unfortunately, because it just wasn't good. I might be open to trying out the upstairs, but all around we were pretty disappointed with the service and the food.",2 star rating,Alexis G.
7/29/2015,"West Sacramento, CA",Ok this is two review in one. 1st time I ate here I had a beer at the bar downstairs and some clam chowder. BEST clam chowder I have ever had. Later that evening I returned and ordered the fish and chips from the bar upstairs and I don't like fish and chips but heard that they were a must try. They were delicious I raved and raved about them. This visit was during the weekday minimal crowd.Came back at a later date with the kids and hubs ordered the same items and while still good most definitely not up to the same level of delicious. This visit was on the weekend and it was very busy so that might have contributed to the difference.  Slightly disappointed but it was still a solid meal and the girls liked their clam chowder.

GREAT dressing, slaw and either pilaf or fries, we both chose pilaf) and I had the salmon with like accompaniments. Both meals were exceptional.

3/24/2014,"San Diego, CA","I was walking around the water front and saw this place.  It is practically surrounded by the commercial fishing fleet with boats unloading their catch right in front of the restaurant.Unfortunately Brophy Bros is seeming unable to tap into the fresh caught local fish market.It is a cool looking place with a nice deck overlooking the ocean and the waterfront.While looking over the menu I asked the hostess what type of fish they used in their fish and chips.  I knew it was going to bad when she didn't , and had to go ask someone.  (Come on people teach your staff to know the menu)When she did figure it out, I was expecting to her to say ""fresh Halibut"" or ""rockfish"".  Instead they told me it was SWAI.  WTF???  How can a restaurant on the water actually use an imported catfish from the (heavily polluted) Mekong River Delta.  I was disgusted that a restaurant on the water in rock throwing distance of the fishing fleet and the Pacific ocean would serve imported trash fish.I thanked them and turned around to leave. As I did, the hostess and the server both bid me farewell in a mocking tone.  Awesome.Maybe they have some other good food but I won't be finding out any time soon. in case your not familiar with Swai, please continue to read on:  Swai is a type of freshwater catfish that is farmed in south east Asia, and there are two species that kind of all get lumped together.Swai is being marketed in the United State as Basa, Pangasius and Iridescent Shark, and most of the farmed fish come from the Mekong River Delta. ""The Mekong River is one of the most polluted waterways in the world. Numerous factories get rid of the chemical byproducts, dumping them into the streams. While pangasius fish can survive in such an extreme environment, they absorb all these contaminants. As omnivores, they eat whatever is available in the environment. Some breeders feed the fish trash and rotting matter to cut down the cost of the Swai aquaculture. Pangasius fish bred in such circumstances, indeed, contain the toxic chemicals.""""Injecting the fish with hormones helps to stimulate their growth. Certain breeders are able to make their fish grow four times as fast as they do in the natural habitat. Frequent use of antibiotics serves to control disease but can lead to the contamination of meat and development of antibiotic resistant pathogens.However, reliable farms utilize the clean areas of the rivers or breed the fish in artificial ponds. Frequent water changes and filtration maintain the quality of water, so that the fish avoid absorbing the pollutants. Trustworthy breeders feed the fish food scraps, dedicated fish pellets and rice bran. The carefully selected diet leads to healthier fish and improves the quality of their meat. Limited use of the antibiotics allows them to break down, instead of accumulating in the bodies of Pangasius Catfish.""To choose the safe, healthy fillets, look for the fish imported from any known, reliable commercial aquaculture. If the farm is not mentioned on the packages, check if the meat has been tested for the presence of the antibiotics and contaminants. Try to avoid panga fillets of unknown origin, as there's a good chance that they are imported from these shady farms. The responsible shopping habits serve to reinforce the correct commercial breeding techniques. They protect the consumers from ingesting the toxic ingredients.How do the commercial fisheries impact the natural habitat? There are a few risks of the negative influence of the Pangasius farms. Excessive use of the land areas and water supply can divert them from the ecosystem or the needs of the local communities. Organized planning regarding the placement and density of the Swai farms can minimize the negative influence of fish breeding on the natural habitat.The Swai aquaculture requires many frequent water changes to maintain the health of the fish population in the ponds. This can mean releasing dirty water into the environment, with the results similar to the effects of the pollution with fertilizers. However, efficient water filtration systems can protect the water supply from getting contaminated by the excessive fish waste.When the Swai Fish multiply in the non-native rivers, there's the risk of the runaway specimen starting to breed on their own and disturbing the balance of the local ecosystems. Pangasius fish often out-compete native species of animals, as these fish are wide ranging and able to handle extremes in environment. That's why farming Swai in fish ponds is safer for the environment than utilizing cages placed in the rivers.Pond cultivation prevents the fish diseases from transferring to the local wild populations as well. While commercial farming of the Swai Fish can negatively impact the environment, ecological breeding methods neutralize the potential problems. Supporting the sustainable farms promotes the local economy of the developing areas, while protecting the environment.",1 star rating,Jake M.

2/23/2014,"Santa Fe Springs, CA","We went here on a Sunday afternoon about 1130am. Wait was about 40mins, we were given a pager and was told we can walk the marina. Beautiful day, busy with families and couples and fishermen. Sat on a bench and enjoyed the sun and the view. Fast forward to 40mins, pager buzzed and we were seated outdoor on their patio. Appetizers: 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell ($9.95) and calamari. Oysters were clean and not too big, served with marinara and horseradish. Probably the cheapest we've come across all weekend in SB. Calamari was perfectly battered, served with dipping sauce (I think some kind of Cajun). You can taste the freshness. Main course: crab cakes and seafood pasta. BOMB! I was already getting full from our appetizers that I was only able to finish one crab cake, the other one would be my snack for later. Seafood pasta included shrimp, scallops, clams, squid, embedded in fettuccini. DEE-LISH-USSS!! Drinks: bf had kona coffee (had liquor) and this was served warm, he liked it but asked for a glass of ice and preferred it cold. I had a Stella Artois FTW. Overall great food and experience except the part where an angry hostile seagull kept thing to fly in to snatch our bread.

5/17/2014,"Oakland, MD","I came in around 4:30pm after work on a weekday (May 14, 2014). There were maybe 3-4 people by the bar upstairs, and no one in the main dining area inside. The people ahead of me were seated outside without reservations. When it was my turn, the hostess didn't really greet - she just said there was going to be an hour wait for the balcony tables before I even said anything. I intended to stay indoors anyway since I had been outdoors all day.I ordered the Fish and Chips, and a cup of clam chowder, since reviewers have been raving about. The clam chowder was a little better than average, but for about an 8oz cup of chowder for $4.75, it wasn't really worth it. I think Splash Cafe's is still better; and Fish and Chips that tastes like any Fish and Chips at a carnival for $10.75 was definitely not worth it. The servers don't really talk to you much or make any conversation other than, ""Everything good?"" or ""You doing alright?"". When they do talk to you, it's just a few quick words, followed by a whoosh of air on their way to the next table as if they're really busy (haha) despite the fact I came at a quiet time. When they're not doing anything, 2-3 of them like to crowd around the register just chatting amongst themselves.I should've known the reason this restaurant has so many reviewers is because it's one of those tourist trap restaurants located in a prime location (by the harbor and next to the Maritime Museum) - shame on me.",1 star rating,J C.

2/18/2015,"Fremont, CA","Don't get what the hype is all about :(I was excited to try their fish and chips and clam chowder based off the reviews. Maybe the clam chowder would've been better if it was hotter? We sat near the bar downstairs so it's possible our food was sitting and cooled. Anyway, it was good - but does not live to the standards of everybody else's reviews. Fish & Chips - At first, I really enjoyed the fried fish. It was crispy, light, and hot when it was served with a big plate of fries. After a while though, the fish and fries cool and it just doesn't taste as good anymore. Really overwhelming with trying to eat all the food that has cooled down. I'm not a slow eater either. The fries were just regular fries, a bit on the thicker side that tasted plain. My friend had the fried calamari - it was decent.Overall - mediocre was this place. The location is great, next to the wharf and close to the boats and water. Good views.",3 star rating,Shilly W.

7/8/2014,"Bakersfield, CA","Not sure what all of the hype is about.  While sitting in there eating today I started reading some of the reviews and a few people got it spot on.  I think its just in a popular tourist area where, perhaps, people do not eat fish & chips often?  I'm not sure.  First, our hostess was kind of rude.  We asked if we could sit outside and were told ""Oh I just sat someone so it will be awhile"".  So everyone out there had JUST been seated?? Ok.  I ordered the fish & chips on a recommendation and a cup of clam chowder.  I did not care for the clam chowder at all, didn't even finish my cup.  Splash Cafe in Pismo is far superior.  The fish in the fish & chips was not only bland but soggy.  Not like the nice firm and flaky fish I'm used to.  I barely ate any of it.  The service was quick and our waitress was efficient.  They do NOT have a kids menu so I ended up paying more for a cut up piece of chicken off of a sandwich for my 10 year old, than for my own lunch.  A different waitress gave us our check and we asked for separate checks which completely annoyed her and she stated ""I have no idea what you guys ordered I'm not your waitress""...but she was pulling it up on the computer to ask us for our money while saying this.  Go somewhere else.  We won't be returning.",3 star rating,Kelli B.
4/3/2014,"Twentynine Palms, CA","In the past I would give this place a 4 stars, been going sense the eighties, this last trip has soured my admiration for this once 4 star eatery. arrived and as usual the place was packed I was able to find one seat at the bar. ordered my usual oysters on the half shell and a brew,  they arrived just a couple minutes later. The beer was cold and the oysters fresh just wasn't shuck properly, had quite a bet of shell broke off in the meat. Not a big problem until the price and expectation is thrown in. Next up a crab and shrimp salad look good but the shrimp was clearly a cheep farmed import lacking any flavor what so ever.   The real kicker for why I won't be returning after all these years is the way the bartender treated a older costumer (60ish) setting a few chairs down. Next to me was 3 ladies (30ish) that one of the bartender was clearly interested in. When the ladies showed interest in the gentleman's conversation it clearly upset the bartender, after a short while the older gentleman ordered he was told he had too many and would be relegated to coffee. This man was not intoxicated, not loud, not rude, just enjoying good conversation drinks and dinner. No slurring his speech, defiantly not tipsy, just a butt hurt bartender. He quietly paid his check and then the ladies and him headed out.     In all the years I have never seen the bar with just one patron me, it was a mass exit. Some of those including an older couple that had just found seating at the bar let them know why they were leaving.    Go for the best view in Santa Barbra just don't expect much in the way of quality, I will say this was just one low level employee, but where was the management?

The entree food came out very bland, however the clam chowder was very good.  Now back to the service, I could not for the life of me wave down our server which hung out at the end of the bar with other workers.  So I had to get up and walk over to ask for some sauce for my fish and I was told it would come right out.  Well I saw the cook fill the ramekin and left it on the shelf but no one to come get it, once I was about to get up again, our waitress was walking by and I asked her for some sauce and she brought it but she did not address us to see it the food was good.  The next time she came by was to give us the check.  Very expensive for a party of 4 with bad service and mediocre food.",2 star rating,Diego S.

Well, fellow yelpers did not let me down this time! SoCal does not have a whole lot of good seafood restaurants. You either have to go to Mexico, South America, or the Pacific Northwest to find quality seafood. There are some fancy good looking places but most are overrated. Brophy Bros has got it right! We expected a wait and were given a beeper and told an approximate time. It was about a 45 minute wait. Once seated, we were served promptly with a smile. We ordered a dozen oysters and they were fresh and excellent. We also ordered clams, calamari, clam chowders, fish & chips, cioppino, and New York steak. They were all very good and my daughter enjoyed her steak. Steamed clams were so good that I ordered another order and ate ithem all myself. My wife even commented that her cioppino was flavorful and tasty. That says something considering she's a picky eater.This place does not disappoint and we'll be back for sure.",5 star rating,J P.

Down home and true eating with lots of flavors and options. My favorite is the Cioppino, especially with their crusty sourdough bread, mm mm! This past weekend I got to try their seafood pasta and clam chowder. Their seafood pasta is a must get on my list from now on. Tons of seafood and the pasta was cooked perfectly with a light white sauce. The clam chowder was not the best I've had, too thick for my liking, but it did have big chunks of sweet clam in here.It's small at Brophy Bros, and everyone is pretty much sitting on top of each other.

We were okay with that. Then she comes back to tell us that they also ran out of pasta. Another disappointment to add to the list. We ordered the crab cakes instead which supposedly comes with coleslaw however, when our order came out, there was no coleslaw on our plate. We got fries and rice instead. The crab cakes were good and the seafood was good but the fact that we came here to order some specific was quite a disappointment. We got seated outside, which had a nice view of the harbor.

The service was very prompt and friendly enough, even with the rush of the lunch hour. It was packed. The place had a seafood shack kind of feel and the ambiance was chill and pleasant. But the food was....Calm Chowder: the initial taste was quite pleasant, but after five spoonful you feel heavy and don't want to continue eating it. It was definitely chunky and creamy.  3 starsCalamari: this place is known for this dish and it was pretty good. The breading though, continuous fell off. The calamari itself was very tender and wasn't chewy at all. Flavor was kind of bland. 3.7 starsTuna melt: an open sandwich style, with a thick, soft white bread with a lot of tuna and a slice of cheese melted on top. It was good. There was fries and coleslaw. Fries needed a bit more salt. Cole was like whatever. 3 stars1/2 calms 1/2 mussels with broth: the worst I ever had. I love calms and mussels and have tried it at so many restaurants. This place overcooked the mussels so much that they shriveled into a small, tiny rubbery dime like thing.  The calms were just slightly overcooked. The broth was disgusting, tasted like dirty water with a lot of salt...I don't know where all the sweetness of the calms and mussel go? They gave me a bowl of broth and then on the side, another cup filled with broth too. Where did all that broth come from?  I'm used to having very little,  but delicious, sweet, savory broth.

It's upstairs with no elevator? A little hard for my wife to get up the stairs on crutches. 3. It's usually packed and there is a wait - But that's because they are AWESOME.Every time I pass through Santa Barbara this is the place to eat.",5 star rating,Jason L.
10/18/2014,"Salt Lake City, UT","Can we just say The BeSt Clam Chowder on the Planet?!?!Yep.  It's that good.   And worth waiting for.They don't take reservations, so be prepared to stroll along the docks or find a seat on a nearby retaining wall.  Better yet, I understand you can eat in their bar on the street level off much the same menu as the upstairs dining room.  If you only have one night for seafood in Santa Barbara, go to Brophy Brothers.  It's THAT good!We closed up the restaurant the night we went, and still had heart service and weren't rushed one bit. Great experience, fun location, just wished we could have made reservations.",4 star rating,Elle P.
2/21/2012,"Glendale, CA","What better way to wind down after a day of Solvang exploring, surrey bike riding, beer tasting and casino gambling?  Hit up some seafood right by the pier!  Our merry group came here for a late dinner before driving back to LA.  We got here about an hour before closing and didn't have to wait at all.We split the BEER BOILED SHRIMP (it's alright...reminds me of college when we used to make this on the grill) and 1/2 DOZEN OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL (I love raw oysters...gotta hit up a raw bar soon!  These were shucked well.), plus we each had an OYSTER SHOOTER (these were virgin and oh so good!).For my meal, I had a cup of their amazing NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER (definitely get a cup or bowl of this) and the FISH 'N' CHIPS.  You get three tender pieces of fish.  I liked the batter, but found the frying inconsistent...one piece was slightly underdone and another was overdone.  It came with decent fries and a scoop of coleslaw.This location does not take reservations.  Coming as late as we did that was a non-issue.  That also meant we didn't get to enjoy the harbor view.",4 star rating,Carol L.

The yelp reviews and pictures dragged us 180 miles away from home to this glorious seafood haven. Started with an oyster shooter each. Lip smacking, nose burning , super kickstart to our meal. Shared a cup of the best clam chowder in the whole world. So creamy, thick and chunky that I bet it will be your best too!! Followed this with a seafood hot combo (beer boiled clams and mussels, two garlic baked oysters and two herb baked clams) and a plate of fish and chips. Washed down all this with some Pinot noir. So so so good. All this great and super fresh food and drinks for $60!!!! This place is just toooo good to miss people!",5 star rating,D R.

After getting the bill, the usual deduction for the fish was much smaller. When I asked the manager why, he said the price was set by the chef. Really? I don't think so. Also, as we were dining on the deck, a refrigerated truck pulled up below and ran its motor for at least a half hour. The couples at the table behind us shouted at each other over the noise.

I ordered the blackened sea bass, my wife ordered the fish & chips and we split an appetizer. (Garlic baked clams.)Holy F%$#aroo! The sea bass melted in my mouth, the rice pilaf was the best I've had in quite some time, the garlic baked clams were amazing, the clam chowder was top notch and (get this) actually had clams!

Parking was kind of difficult outside, but we were lucky enough to find a spot in front of the yacht place. We went up the stairs to the sit-down location and sat outside because although it was cold, the girl had told us that the heater is nice and warm. We believed her and it was a great decision because we were able to enjoy the view of the sunset peeking through just before it turned dark. We weren't too hungry so we decided to share a few plates. We had the cold combo, oyster rockefeller/garlic clams (6 piece total), and the shrimp/crab salad. Our food all came out delicious! Such fresh quality and the taste was amazing. I loved the cold combo because it came with different kind of raw seafood...including oyster, clams, ceviche, crab, and shrimp. I would definitely come back!",5 star rating,Eri K.

7/29/2014,"Woodside, NY","This place had a great view of the marina. That was probably the only thing going for it because the food was standard. Apparently it is a favorite local spot and it gets very crowded. The seating outside was very tight, I had to squeeze in to my chair without bumping in to the other seat. There were also many people hovering around us because people stood near the windows as they are waiting for the tables since there was no room at the bar. The food came out very fast and the waitress was very attentive and checked in on us frequently.Blackened sea bass- Fish was very flakey, but I think the blacked seasoning/searing overpowered the delicate fresh fish. All I tasted was the charred taste, which became bitter after a while.Fried bay scallops- scallops were very sweet and fresh. The breading was light, however it needed more seasoning. Clams in white wine sauce- The clams were excellent by itself. However the white wine sauce was too overpowering. All I tasted was the white wine, it needed more of the other seasonings. Clam chowder- pretty good. Lots of clams and fish.",3 star rating,Khin Z.

The waitress and bus guy are super fast.  Most of the other things I tasted here (didn't try out the full menu yet) was bland.I ordered the Hot appetizer just to try everything out. It's ok for the most part. The beef shrimp, steam clam and mussel is fresh, but you can tell they didn't put any seasoning into it. The stuffed oyster and clam is good and recommended. We ordered crab cake and swordfish. The crab cake is good to try but nothing memorable. The swordfish is very disappointing. It's just bland and overcooked. The side coleslaw is terrible.

6/23/2014,"Azusa, CA","Clam chowder! The words ring in my head like a bell, and any place touting good chowder lights up my radar. When I asked the locals about good seafood and chowder, Brophy Bros was one of the two names dropped. I didn't go to BB that time, but I can now say that I definitely saved the best for last!If you're looking for a table on a weekend, you should make plans to wait for a bit. We had to wait about 20 minutes, enough time to visit the nearby ""museum"". I was feeling a little adventurous, and I tried an oyster shooter for starters. I decided to try it all fixed up, to try to get the real experience. It turns out that they put a good dollop of horseradish in the shot glass, and I'm not a big fan of horseradish. No big deal, it paired okay with the yummy oyster and the cocktail sauce, and washed down real nice with the anchor steam. Up comes the chowder. New England, please; I don't go for the Manhattan these days. My mouth waters as I type this section, as I can still say this is the best clam chowder I've ever enjoyed. Consistency, clam quality/quantity, freshness, potato, spices, the whole darned thing up to the portion size, it was a BULLSEYE!I'll definitely be back to Brophy Bros, hoping that the wait isn't too long, and that I can save a little bit of appetite for a bite of the much talked about fish and chips.",5 star rating,Carlos F.

8/5/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","The food here wasn't as great as I'd hope it would be, but it wasn't bad. We ordered the Clam Chowder, Fish and Chips, and the Cold Combo. The chowder was definitely the best thing we ordered. It was the perfect flavor and texture, not watery or too chunky. The Fish and Chips were decent; the batter to fish ratio was good and it was crispy. I wouldn't recommend the Cold Combo; I've had better seafood platters. The best things about Brophy Bros is its customer service and the view. The waitresses and bartenders were very friendly and attentive. They were constantly checking on us to see if we needed anything. And the location of this place is prime, it's right next to the marina and it has a great view even from inside. It's a nice place to eat on a warm sunny day. If only they had beers on tap...I would come back just to drink and enjoy the view!",3 star rating,Chelsea W.
4/23/2018,"Cumming, GA","We came here from some local recommendations, but found the fare to be average at best. On the positive side, great location, tremendous harbor views and nice ambience...and the sides were good...bread, slaw, french  fries. But as far as the entrees were concerned, we found them to be commercial in nature and certainly less value as to the price charged. Being reasonably traveled abroad and in the US, I would give this experience a ""tourist trap"" rating as there are many other more highly valued restaurants in the area.",3 star rating,Mike H.

We started with a cup of thick New England clam chowder served with a tiny packet of oyster crackers. Chowder was thick and full of clams with just the right amount of potatoes.

9/18/2013,"Jersey City, NJ","I think this might be a case of a restaurant being touted as ""the best in Santa Barbara"" and it just being a let down. Maybe my expectations were too high?It's right on the marina, and has a gorgeous view. But that was about it for me.The FLIES! Oh good lord, the flies! There were thousands of them. I sent two glasses of wine back because it looked like the flies were having swim meets in them.I got the fried calamari, which was good, but mainly cause I was so hungry. The batter was really heavy and I was too busy swatting flies out of my hair to really pay more attention.I also got the ahi tuna - it came with mounds of rice and cole slaw. I love cole slaw. But not this one. :( Le sad.The ahi itself - again, maybe my expectations were just too high - was awful. They asked how I liked it cooked and I said medium rare (which the waitress replied that was how she would have recommended it). I saw that it was ""breaded"" but with cashews - so I wasn't expecting it to come out as a fried fish fillet. It was fried... and medium rare/cool inside. The hot breading + cool inside = mushiness that I couldn't finish.I really enjoyed the views and the waitress was great, but I wouldn't recommend it.",2 star rating,Sara E.

A great cioppino would should have mussels shrimp scallops clams and some fish chunks , not just 1 of the above .

Added our name to the list and were quoted an hour and a half wait time. No big deal, so we decided to walk around to kill some time. Half way through the walk, we got paged, so we hurried back and did the usual ""hey, here's my pager, seat me, I'm ready to eat!"" But this time, we were greeted with a different response..""I'm sorry, you're table isn't ready yet..we didn't actually page you."" A bad start.We were about to leave after waiting for two hours, when we decided to go to the hostess table to complain.. and they seated us.. Ordered clam chowder, a chicken sandwich, and seafood pasta. The chowder was okay (we've had better chowder), pasta was good (shrimp and scallop were moist and the pasta was al dente), chicken sandwich was bad (dry chicken, doughy bread, no sauce, scalding-hot vegetables). When the waitress came by to fill up our glasses, she missed a glass. While we were eating, a couple got seated next to us and ten minutes later they were asked to get up because the table was needed for another party. I'm not sure what the situation was, but I would be frustrated if that happened to me...Overall, a bad experience.

It's got a nice water view you can sit out on the deck for or you can sit inside and avoid all the hungry birds waiting to peck at your seafood.The prices are reasonable and the clam chowder is yummy! Highly recommend the raw seafood offerings they have as well as the crabs which are always fresh and very worthy.

The shrimp and crab salad had a generous serving of shrimp and crab in a delicious sauce, the salad was very tasty. The seafood pasta had a few too many tomatoes on it for my daughters liking, but again a good amount of seafood in a very tasty sauce.I deducted a star for how crowded and noisy it was in the main dinning hall.

8/2/2011,"West Covina, CA","The place has amazing fresh seafood... that's for sure. The downside, they don't take reservations, so its first come first serve, making the wait pretty long if you have a big party or if you want to sit outside on the balcony. We ordered the 1/2 doz oysters, bowl of clam chowder, oyster shooters, and the hot seafood combo platter. The clam chowder definitely lived up to it's reputation here. My fave has to be the oyster shooters. O man, that was one of the best oyster shooters I've ever had, with just the right amount of horseradish for the kick. For the hot combo platter, I have to say my favorite was the garlic, baked clams. The beer boiled shrimp was, so so. Nothing real special on that. We also ordered the halibut dinner, but I have to admit, we were super full since we were eating all day at other venues in Downtown Santa Barbara for our day getaway.  We weren't able to finish our main meal, so we took it to go. I'd give this place 5 stars, but they cleaned up our wine before we can finish it. Grant it, the place was busy, but when I left for the ladies room and my husband went to get a toothpick, they started cleaning up our table. I mean our wine glasses were pretty much full, we had our to go box still on the table. What a waste of our glasses of wine that we paid for.

4/22/2014,"Grover Beach, CA","Sadly the experience we had here was not a good one. It seemed to be the most happening restaurant compared to the others nearby on the harbor and had people waiting to get in - so we thought it was a good sign. We were seated right away because we were just a party of two. We sat outside and they had heat lamps, which was nice. We were drawn to the restaurant because it was a clam bar, it was packed and in a good location. The view was nice, but the food disappointing, especially since we were craving good seafood towards the end of our stay in SB.Service could have been better and more helpful. Our waitress seemed rushed and was not very pleasant. Clam chowder was pretty good, but the raw oysters had no flavor and sadly neither the clams or the oysters were local.  The hot sampler was over cooked - making all the seafood very rubbery. The shrimp was small, overcooked and had ZERO flavor, same goes for the mussels. The fact that it was local, we were expecting it to taste fresh and have more flavor since it's cooked in a beer broth ... yeah, no hint of flavor on the shrimp or in the broth. For a place that say they are a ""clam bar,"" shouldn't they have more selection of clams for the choosing? Perhaps we ordered the wrong things or it was an off night, but I doubt we will be coming back here next time we are in town.It was loud as many reviewers have mentioned, so conversation was a bit straining.  The seating outside was packed with people standing by the bar really close to the tables while the wait staff try to squeeze by with food. It seems to be a place for locals to hang out as well as tourists. We walked out of there as quickly as dinner was over feeling like we just got tourist trapped and flushed $80 down the drain.  We also ordered a few cocktails from the bar - all of which were ok, but couldn't make up for the disappointing food we had.  Need to scout out a better seafood place in SB.",1 star rating,Baylee L.

1/3/2009,"Irvine, CA","For my first review of 2009 I'm proud to write about Brophy Brothers.  We came here on the recommendation of our Innkeeper (thanks Stan!!) - we were looking for some seafood and he raved about Brophy Brothers.  We came to Brophy Brothers at around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was still a crazy line (9 parties were in front of us), but after all the anticipation we were willing to wait.  We were able to get outdoor seating within 30 minutes of waiting.  The hostess continually apologized for the long wait even though it wasn't her fault.  I appreciate that.  Overall, the service here was great!  Now onto the food...I came here for one main thing - raw oysters!!  You get a half dozen oysters on the half shell for $8.95.  These were some of the freshest oysters I've had.  Soo good and hit the spot so much that I decided to place another order of them.  The cocktail sauce you use with the oysters were enhanced with crushed garlic... genius!  As for our other dishes...Cioppino - this is a seafood stew dish in a tomato based broth topped with parmesan cheese ($11.95).  I was delighted to see this on the menu because it's one of my favorite seafood dishes (the warm soupiness just hits the right spot for me).  This dish was just okay here but the fish and mussels in it were super fresh.  I was a little disappointed that there were only chunks of white fish and no salmon in the soup.  The soup base wasn't as flavorful as I've had at other seafood restaurants.  No complaints but nothing spectacular either.Baked Salmon dish ($21) - this was on their special ""fresh fish of the day"" menu.  You could tell the salmon was super fresh and everything was nice and flaky.  The color of the salmon was redder than your typical salmon, leading me to believe that they served us Sockeye Salmon rather than the ever so common Atlantic Salmon.  Came with a side of french fries, coleslaw, and cup of clam chowder.The french fries were average... on the bland and less crispy side.  The good thing was they didn't taste overly greasy so it doesn't make you feel gross at the end.  The clam chowder came out piping hot and very creamy, with huge chunks of clams embedded in the soup.  Mmm tasty tasty... Brophy Brothers was a hit!",4 star rating,Angela C.

We never had a empty plate on the table.The service was on top of it, when one plate was empty, she made sure the next appetizer was on the table next.They time everything well.. they kept the food coming, that's actually smart business.  Instead of just overlapping soups/salads/appetizers/meal.. They time it to where when your done with one thing the next thing comes out.Food was good, Nothing amazing, but its good enough  mixed with the service which would entice me to go again. For the price, you cant go wrong.",5 star rating,Marc D.

Flavors were real superb even though they are basic dishes, they brought out the flavors really well! Next time we come down we are definitely going again. Loved it! Service:  The service was great! Even though they were really busy, it didn't take too long to get a table and once we did they were really helpful and very friendly. On a side note, we sat at the bar because it was open seating but ended up going back to wait for a table because the blonde bar tender would not help us, we tried to ask questions about the menu and she gave us a quick answer then ignored us to go do something else. Overall:  Food was full of flavor, amazing! 5/5                Service is very friendly! 5/5",5 star rating,Aaron D.

This place was definitely hustling and bustling around noon.  Went upstairs, exchanged our keys for a pager and waited about 2 minutes before we were called.  Flying trays of steaming seafood made me want to order everything, but after much deliberation, we ended up w/ the following:Clam chowder:  pretty solid.  Beer boiled shrimp:   flavorful, but a bit messy to eat.  Crab cakes (served with a tarragon and mustard cream sauce): divine... lumpy & chunky and lightly breaded!Their fresh seafood platters also looked wonderful.  I'd definitely return to this SB locals favorite!",4 star rating,Jenni C.

Manager stopped by and said hello. Two dudes at the bar were killin it. It was an excellent lunch here. It was so great I came back two days later to eat it again and had another great time.

We also tried their shrimp, steamed muscles, and Oysters; they we so fresh they tasted almost sweet; the weakest thing was the fried calamari which I did not really care for.  Every time we go we sit in the patio; the gorgeous view of the harbor is well worth the little extra wait.  if you are in Santa Barbara do yourself a favor and try them out, they might look like a tourist trap but they are far from it.",5 star rating,Pharomarc M.

7/21/2008,"Sunnyvale, CA","Review for the casual downstairs bar area. Delivers all you could ever want for buttery or fried seafood snacks. 8-)Cost to worth it ratio: 3 starsHighlights:- Good snacks: small list but from clams to shrimp to scallops, you can't go wrong. I was worried by the touristy nature of the place that it may be like some Fisherman's Wharf spots in SF that locals know to avoid, but it wasn't like that at all and was good eats.- Baked clams: the reason we came here, as I heard great things about it. They're served in little carved out pockets of a tray, doused in garlic butter and topped with breadcrumbs. This combined with the fresh clam and it's own clammy juices is a rich, seafoody treat. Perfect mix of a variety of flavors and textures in one bite.- Scallops: mini scallops breaded and fried, but somehow not too greasy.- Staff: very friendly, checked on us often to see if we needed drink refills, etc.Lowlights (my flip side to highlights):- Snacks for seafood lovers only. So in my case, not hub friendly. Not even onion rings or french fries or chicken strips on the menu, but the staff was nice enough to sneak us some fries so the hub didn't have to be the only non-snacker.- Long wait for the restaurant upstairs for the full menu: over an hour on a Sunday afternoon.I'd return for more seafood treats and a cocktail. Makes for a perfect stroll to the pier Santa Barbara day. I'd also like to try the restaurant with the extended menu, more room, and a view as well.",4 star rating,Eve K.
5/14/2016,"Honolulu, HI",Very underwhelming considering the reviews. My friend had the seabass which was very dry and over cooked. My other friend had the crab cakes which was bland and the sauce was watered down. The service was very average. We would not come here again.,1 star rating,J M.

11/6/2010,"Burlingame, CA","Came for a sunset dinner on a Friday night. We were handed a pager and headed downstairs to the overflow bar. Very cute, right on the harbor, everyone else was jam packed upstairs. The downstairs bartender made us two Bloody Mary's. One of the best I've ever had! Strong, spicy, delicious. A few minutes later we beeped and headed up.They gave us a great corner table outside where we had a view of the harbor on one side, a view of the ocean on the other and a sunset on both sides. Our waitress was attentive, albeit a tad pushy. She recommended the clam chowder which we immediately had. We later found out that the entrees come with a cup of chowder but she was happy to apply the cup we'd already had. So that was cool.The chowder is, as everyone says, fantastic. If my experience had ended here. I might have given Brophy a five star review but definitely four stars. We also ordered the garlic clams which she insisted we try -- it's their signature dish. WIth the amount of bread crumbs, butter and bacon on them (frankly, I hardly tasted garlic at all), who knew there was a clam underneath? I don't get the raves on this one. It was just salty and expensive. When I get seafood, I want to taste the seafood. I would have liked to try some oysters or at least fresh clams.I was craving spaghetti alle vongole but it wasn't on the menu. I considered the linguine with shrimp and scallops but instead opted for the shrimp scampi. Shrimp plus butter -- how can you go wrong? I have to say, both of our entrees were really mediocre. They LOOKED good but both in texture and taste were so-so to not good. He got crab cakes which were so full of red bell pepper that's all I could taste and the texture was like mayonnaise. My shrimp were rubbery and a bit tasteless and came in a viscous sauce that didn't resemble butter and wasn't good. I forced myself to eat two. Even the French fries were a disappointment. I seriously thought at that point that they must buy the chowder because it was so much better than everything else.Two drinks, one appetizer, two dinners came to $81 which seemed a bit pricey to me for the quality. (They don't serve desserts, by the way).  I would definitely come back for the view, a Bloody Mary and a bowl of chowder but will try another restaurant for great seafood.",3 star rating,Angelique L.

We had oysters Rockefeller which were good although be careful as they were served over rock salt which got into one or two and I thought I was going to chip a tooth. Next we had the beer boiled shrimp which was the best plate of our dining.  They had coriander, garlic, dried whole red peppers for a little warmth. Last we had some ahi poke which was good but not quite the Hawaiian version to which I was familiar with. The pieces were a little large but the quality of fish was good. It is served over a bed of mixed spring greens and the seasoning of shoyu and sesame oil was scant The view on the terrace was beautiful but the space was loud and a little cramped.

8/27/2013,"West Covina, CA","Arrived on a Monday night a quarter past 7 PM and was told the wait was going to be 45 minutes to an hour. We put our name down and the wait turned out to only be 25 minutes. We ordered a cup of clam chowder, and the ceviche appetizer. They ran out of their Mahi Mahi special by the time we were seated so we opted for the Sea bass special which came with a cup of chowder ($1 extra to make it a bowl), the choice of lemon rice pilaf or French fries, and their coleslaw. We received a basket of sourdough bread as we were waiting. Olive oil provided upon asking our waiter. We read reviews that te chowder was amazing but I personally preferred the chowder you can find at the Santa Barbara Shellfish company on the pier, or at Nikki's fish market and Grill on Goleta (their whole menu is recommended!) The ceviche appetizer came at the same time as the sea bass. It was a huge portion but the flavor was just alright. There was a good amount of seafood bits in there but the flavor that dominated was the tomato and it tasted like I was eating pico de gallo rather than ceviche. I wish they had some Serrano or jalapeño peppers in it to spice it up. It was also served with a side of ketchup mixed with horseradish, as well as two packets of saltine crackers. The sea bass was blackened and Cajun spiced. Their was definitely a good amount of spices on the fish but What was lacking primarily was seasoning on the whole dish. The fish was a little dry and I after eating a third I didn't have any desire to further finish the dish. The lemon rice pilaf was also heavily under seasoned. Good thing salt and pepper shakers are provided on the table or else much of our dinner would have been extremely bland.  The lemon flavor was very subtle if at all there. The rice overall tasted similar to what I can get at a diner chain like Denny's. if I ever come back, I would opt for the French froes option rather than the rice. The coleslaw, like the rest of the dish, remained under seasoned. It was neither salty nor sweet as would be expected in a coleslaw. It came lukewarm when it should be served colder and was highly watery. My friend and I did not even touch this side. Sharing plates also gets you a $6 additional charge so keep in mind not to let them know. Our waitress was really nice in the beginning but after our meals came we were not checked in on once. It took us a while to get the attention of another waiter to bring us our check and takeout boxes. I was extremely disappointed with my dining experience, especially given the four star rating. It would be highly unlikely that I would come back to this restaurant, but I hear it is their raw items that stand out, so perhaps to try out their cold combo platter (with crabs, oysters, clams and shrimps!)",1 star rating,Iris K.

The plate was SO full of seafood, and we got way more shrimp than the menu said - approximately 20! (I counted.) It was ridiculous, and everything was so flavorful, especially the oysters and clams.We also got the clam chowder, which is a Brophy's classic and has a perfect balance of creamy soup, clams, and potatoes. The service was also really nice, and our waitress was very pleasant and efficient.

5/28/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","A MUST-GO-TO-PLACE if you are in SANTA BARBARA.Clam chowder is AMAZING. Very hardy, full of clams, and each individual clams sends a burst of sweetness in your mouth. Also makes good dip for your bread. OYSTER SHOOTER: Yes, get THIS! $3.75 for a shot sounds absurd but the experience of it is totally worth it. The shot starts out with a slight kick, but then the oyster bursts in your mouth and unleashes a BURST of SWEETNESS that sends you into a period of BLISS for a moment. It's that good.Fried Calamari: For those who have eaten a lot and cooked squid, these things are a pain. Easy for it these things to get rubbery but this restaurant makes calamari that just melts in your mouth. Wait time was only 20 minutes which was great.

My boyfriend and I split 6 oysters, they were very fresh and delicious! My boyfriend had the burger, which was okay nothing special and I had the clam chowder & salad combo which was huge!  The Chowder was really flavorful and had tons of clams in it i got a bowl thinking I was hungry but it really was a lot of food.  The burger was a pretty big plate as well, we both ended bringing some of our dishes home. The service was very nice and attentive but it did get very crowded on the patio since they let the people waiting to be seated stand there and order drinks and food.  My recommendation is get there early if you can and stick to the seafood, that is what they clearly do best!",5 star rating,Sarah S.
8/11/2013,"Sherman Oaks, CA","Had lunch today and opted for the crab, shrimp and avocado salad. Being from Louisiana I love lump blue crab but this was pink crabmeat. Fresh, the waitress said and it was pretty damn good actually. The house dressing is delicious and I got it on the side along with the thousand island it comes with. Served with a generous half avocado and the usual spring mix, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and black olives from a can that seemed out of place on the salad. Husband had the blackened sea bass for $23.95 which comes with generic cole slaw and a choice of either a side salad or a coffee cup of clam chowder. You are also given a choice of either rice pilaf or fries....I don't know about you but for $24, I would have love to have seen a vegetable side dish offered or a starch other than rice or fries.  Still beautiful views, friendly service, an incredibly busy busboy and good fresh fish.  Worth it when there isn't a wait.",4 star rating,Kristin K.

Nothing over-the-top with the food.  The food is good, but not great.  We go there mostly for the service and the ambience",4 star rating,Mario M.

4/15/2011,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","I love discovering where the ""locals"" hang out when I am traveling as you know those places have the best food, best service, and in the case of Brophy Bros- a great view too! I was out in Santa Barbara for a get away long weekend. The skies were blue, the sunshine abundant, and I was looking for a place to wile away the day with some great seafood while enjoying time with a friend that I had cajoled into joining me (he is a die hard Florida fan so I knew I had to come up with a place he would love out on this coast!) Well Brophy Bros certainly over delivered! So much so that we spent two days of our weekend sitting at the bar, drinking some of the coldest beer I have ever had and being served by a great bartender! (I only wish I could remember his name as he was terrific!) And the food? Seemingly we had it all and it was all delicious! First of all the clam chowder. . . .thick, creamy, the perfect start to any meal. Peel and eat shrimp, freshly shucked oysters,or the ceviche are also great starters. The mussels were also quite tasty- big and meaty. We had the fish of the day, the fish sandwich blackened and even a tuna melt. They were all good but the fresh fish of the day prepared the way our server recommended was my favorite. As you sit at the bar- you look out onto the harbor with the mountains in the distance that seem to change color as the sun moves across them, from green, to purple to black. Lovely! And the boats bobbing in the water below this 2nd floor vista made me long for an afternoon of boating. Brophy Bros doesn't take reservations so you may have to wait- especially on the weekends. But trust me- it's worth it. And the friendliness of the locals in the place will have you wishing you lived in the area. We were even invited over to someones home to watch the sunset (doubt that would happen in Chicago!) .  One word of warning- a local bought us a couple of ""oyster shots"" one of the nights we were there.  If offered- take a pass.  This thing was a shot glass with an oyster at the bottom of it covered in tartar sauce, cocktail sauce and topped with tequila. Tough to get down, that's for sure! Not sure my friend will ever eat another oyster again!  Eeks!Entrees range from $9 to $20 and our total bill was only about $75  (including plenty of those cold beers) each time we went.  There is a parking lot at the marina that will run about $13 for all day parking. Next time you are in Santa Barbara, check out Brophy Bros. You know it has it be good if it changed my friend's mind about California versus Florida! Can't wait to go back!",5 star rating,Carol K.

These are the only things you need to have a great time here.Even though I did imbibe in a multitudinous amount of alcohol while spending some time here, I didn't cry this time while eating the baked clams.

8/13/2009,"Phoenix, AZ","So this was the first seafood restaurant I tried in SB (I know, I know). I took my mom and grandma here when they came down to visit. I heard so many good things about this place. It's smaller than I anticipated, but we actually did not have to wait long at all. Maybe around 15 minutes for lunch. My grandma got the hot combo plate, which actually had a few items that I liked. (Really rare since I hate clams/mussels/oysters/etc). My mom got the seafood chef salad which was also good. Not amazing, but not bad either. I went for one of the plates on the fresh fish menu. I originally wanted crab cakes, but they didn't have it that day. :( Instead I ordered the Wild Coho Salmon. The salmon itself was just okay. The colesaw was nothing spectacular either even though everyone raved about it. I did really enjoy the clam chowder though! I regret only getting a small cupful now.The service was good. Everyone is really friendly and my only complaint would be that it took forever to get the check. (Though it's understandable since it was so busy). Definitely coming here again to try out the fish and chips and sandwiches.",4 star rating,Jenny C.

10/9/2007,"Ventura, CA","Tucked away in the Santa Barbara Harbor as the last of a string of restaurants leading up to dock 1.  The portions of delicious seafood are big. A favorite of the locals because it's not as flashy (and much better tasting) than all the other places around there (The Breakwater, Endless Summer Cafe, etc.) You can grab a Bloody Mary and sit at the outdoor bar and gaze over the gorgeous shoreline of the Santa Barbara Harbor. It is ALWAYS worth the long wait. Great chowder, great fish'n'chips, great service, good hearty cioppino, and  the catch of the day is generally delicious as well. In college, one summer, my boyfriend lived on a yacht at dock 1 and we'd love to get dinner and drinks and catch the sunset at Brophy's.

8/18/2008,"West Los Angeles, CA","We were in Santa Barbara one weekend to attend his co-worker's wedding. The day after, we wanted to have brunch before heading back to LA. Initially, we didn't feel this place would be ideal because they don't have the typical breakfast items like omelette and pancakes. But the idea of passing up a seafood spot just didn't get through our mind. After comparing Brophy Brothers with a popular seafood joint, we decided that Brophy might be a better choice since it seemed less touristy and has more personality. We were glad we did: the food was prepared in a simple style yet delicious, the service great and the harbor view pleasant. We enjoyed everything we ordered: beer boiled shrimp, chilled clam on half shell and steamed clam with broth.",4 star rating,Jenny C.

A suggestion that I would make is there 12 oz steak with rice pilaf or there mahi mahi both amazing choices. If your a fan of oysters they have a oyster shooter that will make you say "" keep em coming"", not to be outdone is there clam chowder either cup or in breadbowl ... best in the 805",4 star rating,Eddie M.

And I know from experience that two people can fill the table with food.  I went straight back to the hostess, who said she was new, but almost immediately they pulled the empty table next to us over to combine them.

10/17/2015,"Sherman Oaks, CA","Worth the hour wait for a table for four at 5:30 on a Saturday night. The sourdough bread was very good, and we had to restrain ourselves from filling up before the seafood came. The fish and chips were the best I've ever had. The clam chowder was creamy and chock full of clams. The calamari was good, not overly breaded. My husband had the Hot Combo plate, with mussels, clams, shrimp, and oysters, and enjoyed it. The fries were decent but not fantastic, but we were so full of seafood that it made no difference.The oyster shooters were great, a little spicy with horseradish, and quite a deal at less than $4 each. The Bloody Marys were also very good.Though the place was packed and tables were pretty tight, the wait staff was incredibly friendly, patient, and helpful.

It's located right on the harbor and has both indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend outdoor seating to enjoy the fresh air and view, plus it can get crowded and loud indoors during busy hours. We started off with oyster shooters, which we'll pass on next time, and clam chowder. The clam chowder was really delicious and filling. Casey got seafood pasta, which he always orders at any seafood place, while I got the ciopinno. Both were reasonably priced at about $19 and $14, respectively. Both were delicious, portion sizes were generous, and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. All in all, I recommend.",4 star rating,Casey And Julie T.

9/23/2014,"San Diego, CA","Go. Go. Go! But when you go... prepare to wait to be seated. They have a great little bar down below that you can grab a cocktail or glass of wine while you wait to be seated. Bar tender's are super attentive! (They even gave me a free shot on my birthday while we waited to be seated!) Once seated the food gets there very fast! Items on the menu to skip: I was not a huge fan of the crab cakes. Having just moved from Boston I'm used to big lump crab cakes. The crab was minced up. It wasn't for me (likely a personal preference). Must try: Clam Chowder! Did I mention I moved from Boston? Home to the best clam chowder you'll get? This is the /BEST/!! Honestly I would go just for the chowder it's that good! It has lumps of potatoes and big clams. YUM! Sea Bass: To die for good. Get it with rice and do not miss out on the butter sauce on the side. It is so good! Easily split between two people to save on cost. (Maybe each order your own cup of soup) Enjoy the ambiance of the harbor with the boats and the cool breeze and be seated outside. Or witness your food being prepared and a louder, but definitely fun experience sitting inside (almost always faster).  Servers are attentive, but on the move! Enjoy!",5 star rating,Laura H.

4/16/2011,"Eagle, ID","If you are looking for a great view and pretty dang good seafood and happen to be in Santa Barbara, this is the spot to check out. The place was packed for a Thursday afternoon which is always a good sign to me. We sat upstairs at the bar. The menu is pretty simple and since we had never been there we decided to order the Hot and Cold Appetizer combos which pretty much includes all their appetizers. This is a great idea if you want to try it all. Everything on the plate was flavorful and fresh. From the fresh oysters to the Baked Clams (a must!). Ask for an extra loaf of the sourdough bread because you are going to need it when you taste the broth the steamed clams come in. The clam chowder was really good and had bacon in it. Everything is better with bacon!The good looking staff (not a pimple or muffin top in sight!) were attentive and friendly. The food came out pretty quick and from looking around at all the other tables everything looked good.Only con about this place is the bathroom is the public restroom shared by everyone coming to the marina and it definitely showed.",4 star rating,Lynn J.

7/27/2010,"San Francisco, CA","honestly I'm astounded by some of the negative reviews here, especially the 1 star review. This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Santa Barbara. the food couldn't be fresher, the bloody mary's are to die for and the service is flat out amazing. I can't believe that I have lived in Santa Barbara for five years and only had the pleasure of eating at here just three weeks ago! I had heard amazing things about it and have been wanting to eat here for a while and almost by accident my boyfriend and I wound up hungry and stranded at the harbor. We didn't have to wait long for a perfect table on the balcony, we had clam chowder, fried shrimp, and the hot combination platter. the combo platter was to die for. garlic baked clams, oysters rockefeller, mussels and clams and shrimp dripping in butter and sauce. yum. yum. yum. In the past two weeks we have gone back twice. bringing more and more people with us each time. It is quickly becoming my favorite spots for seafood, you can just taste how fresh everything is. Also the downstairs clam bar is going to be my new hang out. One eyed jack consistently makes the most amazing bloody mary's. The atmosphere is down to earth, friendly, and local. I can't think of Brophy's honestly without smiling like a lunatic. It's been a while since a restaurant in Santa Barbara has excited me this much. just keep in mind this isn't a ""fine dining"" establishment. This is honest, good, fresh seafood at fair prices. It is always packed, especially during the summer, we went last night (monday) and we waited for 45 minutes. But don't let that deter you, just keep it in mind and give yourself extra time for the wait, and use it as an excuse to meet Jack at the clam bar and taste one of his glorious Bloody Mary's.",5 star rating,Niki N.

I was kinda sad when it wasn't. =[Oysters - Gritty. =[ One was kinda dead too. =[ Not a pleasant taste. & tasted fishy.... =[Bloody Mary - ehhh, It was ok, wasn't spicy, the horseradish was at the bottom, but it seemed it was regular type of bloody mary mix. except with the addition of atomic horseradish. ehhhClam Chowder - Pretty good. Chunky bits of clam, not as many fillers such as potatoes and such which was pretty good cause you get the good stuff.

But unfortunately, it just wasn't meant to be, (Brophy) bros! I got their grilled fish sandwich with the fresh fish of the day, which happened to be thrasher shark, with a cup of their clam chowder. Chowder was good, creamy and delicious. But my sandwich, oh man. I don't know if it was the too crunchy bread or the chewy shark but it just did not mesh well. At all. Not to mention, I was having drink envy. Everyone was toting around bloody mary's and mimosas and I didn't even know they were serving them. Not sure if I missed out on a sign or what but yeah, twas not fun. I would've ordered one for myself but our server was slightly MIA, but not as MIA as I would've expected given how crowded the place was at 11 am on a Saturday morning.

Would highly recommend these two items. You get a hefty portion for the clam chowder bowl. The fish and chips were fried perfectly. Nice and crispy. Fish was hot and flaky.

5/22/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I almost could have given 5 stars except for 1 dish. I'll get to that in a minute.My experience here was great from the standpoint of the service. Although the servers could be a little more educated about the menu items.That aside, we were seated  in one of the tables on the outer patio with full view of the harbor at sunset. The view couldn't have been much better anywhere else in the restaurant.  It set a tone and atmosphere as good as any I've experienced.The Food:Pros-Excellent artisan type sourdough!Garlic Clam Bake was so yummy with my Bloody Mary.The oysters and clams and jumbo shrimp on the Cold Combo platter was so fresh!The Clam Chowder is also probably one of the best I've ever had, buttery with nice chunks of clam. Some places sliver the hell out of the clam as to hide the toughness. Every bite of clam in all the dishes I had were tender and delicate as can be for clam. Shrimp and Scallop Pasta was also tasty and fresh, the ingredients were top notch and the linguine was perfectly al dente.Con-I'll never judge a restaurant by 1 dish, but I have to mention my dislike of the Blackened Fish, in this case a Blackened Sea Bass.I've had blackened everything. I've had smoked seafood. I've been in New Orleans tasting the best Blackened Catfish ever. I've never had a Blackened Fish that smelled like cigarettes and tasted burnt. This is not the type of ""Blackened"" I am used to.The Value:For the number of menu selections we ordered and the quality of the ingredients used, the dishes were priced right, and I'd definitely come back anytime I'm at the Santa Barbara Harbor.",4 star rating,Jonathan P.
1/26/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","One of the few places in Santa Barbara that you must try, if you happen to be in the area. We were so lucky we found this place after visiting the Maritime Museum (next door to the restaurant). The wait was long (30 - 45 minutes - it's a small space), but trust me it's worth it. What to order: - Hot Combination Platter ($14.95): comes with boiled shrimp, baked clams with garlic, oysters and mussels... this platter will make you happy!- Cioppino ($12.95) - chunks of fish in tomato based soup, everyone orders it- New England Clam Chowder ($4.25 cup, $6.50 bowl) - adequate, with big chunks or potatoes and clams- Pasta ($8.95) - it was good, with light marinara sauce- Brophy's Cheese Burger ($9.95) - I know, why order a cheese burger at a seafood place? But it was very good, tender and juicy at the same time. It will not disappoint. More plus: - Staff was friendly, fast and unpretentious- Great view of the harbor and Santa Barbara!- good appetizer bread- one waiter was a good looking guy! Need I say more?",5 star rating,I V.
2/11/2015,"Seattle, WA","I was down in Santa Barbara visiting my parents a couple weeks ago and we stopped by Brophys. We told the hostess that we were just having drinks and were seated at a table. Just after our drinks arrived, a manager came to our table and said we would need to get up and go to the bar (standing room only) if we weren't ordering food. While I could understand this policy if the place was packed, there were 3 tables still available that were in the same area as ours. Anyhow, we asked if we could finish our drinks, to which he curtly responded ""No"" and told us we had to move now. I don't know how this guy attained the position of manager, but I don't think I've ever been treated so poorly at a restaurant. Now my parents have decided not to return there and they were regular customers.

Their fish and chips are amazing.  Love their clam chowder.  They have a massive burger (i should have looked up name before I started review) that contains everything good and evil (beef, bacon, avocados, cheese, carmelized onions etc)  that is awesome.  Great food, tons of parking.",5 star rating,susan s.

These were amazing! The fried shrmp were amazingly delish too. Decided to give 3 stars vecause it was super cold (the heaters were not helping) and the fish and chips and the seafood pasta were pretty ""eh"". The clam chowder was really good.

Pasta cooked just al dente and sauce was a good consistency with the right amount of garlic flavor (not overpowering), but scallops were a little overcooked.

The wait was under half an hour so it wasn't too bad!Service: quick and friendlyView: Would've been better around sunset but was still really nice to look at (especially since we got an outdoor table). Don't worry, there are heat lamps!Food:- Clam chowder - good! Creamy, tons of clams, warm and toasty and perfect for a cold day or night.- Hot Combo - clams, oysters, mussels, shrimp, in a very well seasoned broth. An app for 2+ people or a meal for 1. - Mahi mahi - a little tough and underseasoned, but came with a refreshing mango salsa and coleslaw, as well as a large portion of rice.- Swordfish - not my favorite fish and wasn't as tough as I had imagined it to be, but had an interesting texture.

The entrance might be confusing as it is right next to another restaurant/bar entrance. You have to go UP the stairs to get to Brophy Bros.Our experience seems to be a tad different then some of the reviewers. We came here on a late Saturday night (930PM) during an overcast weekend, so there wasn't a wait. We sat outside in the heated patio. Very nice!I cannot comment on the entrees as we just ordered a mix of appetizers:- Beer boiled shrimp: Decent, but it's not Boiling Crab style if that is what you are expecting. Shrimp is smaller and the broth not as flavorful.- Garlic baked clams: Yummy, but if you are not a fan of mayo, this might not be the dish for you.- Clam chowder:( just tasted a spoonful of this) it was creamy and they didn't skimp on the clams!- Oysters: fresh- House salad: dressing was delicious!Service was fantastic.

10/2/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was overall pretty okay.  I found this by Yelp reviews, as I was on a weekend getaway.  The restaurant was very crowded (Sunday night about 5:00).  We had about an hour wait, which I was willing to do because it seemed so promising.  I may have been expecting too much from the rave reviews.  The clam chowder was good, but I can't say how good because we were very hungry (if you know what I mean).  The calimari was a bit chewy and bland.  My husband and I shared beer battered shrimp and fish and chips.  They were both okay; as they say, nothing to write home about.  We both thought the tarter sauce was yummy though.  The cole slaw was also extremely bland.  I give most of my stars for customer service.  It was really good from the time we sat down.  I know they want to get you in and out because there are so many waiting, but at the same time we didn't really feel rushed.  We are aware of people waiting and not the kind that just hang around sipping water and chit chatting after we're done eating.  You have to put yourself back in the shoes of a person waiting for a seat.  You can talk in the car...lol  The place is also very cramped.  They squeezed every table they could in there.  Then, you have people standing up at the bar waiting for thier table, so you have to squeeze by, which while you're at a table eating is a little annoying.  Luckily we were on the end, so didn't get too much of it.Anyway, I would recommend, but not for more than an hour wait.  By the time we left I heard them telling people an hour and a half.  I would find another joint at that point because the food is not exceptional.  But for an hour or less wait I would say give it a try.",3 star rating,Toi H.

2/23/2010,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA","If this place had more space and a wait staff that actually came around...less often, this place would get five stars!  Or they can just give me samplers and free food.  That would get five stars too.  But really, it's more of the cramped conditions that distracted me the most.Coming here at night in a light mist of rain was very endearing.  We were seated at a little table outside (ie under the eves with heaters) which was very cute.  Unfortunately it is also a main highway thin enough that two people walking past each other also tend to brush the unsuspecting diner with a side butt...or a swing of the purse.  But my oh my the veiw from that deck is so pretty.  You can see the harbor and the boats docked up less than 100 feet away.  It makes the super highway worth it.There was also a bar on the corner where people would stand in the middle of this highway of walkers.  They were loud, and standing about 3 feet away from our table.  Not my ideal place for a bar window.  And because they were standing and we were sitting at our little table, their butts were all pretty much eye level to us and within grabbing distance.  Half the time I wouldn't even have to reach that far.Despite the cramped space, it's not really too bad.  We got more of a laugh out of it more than anything.  It wouldn't stop me from coming here again only because I think that in this rare case it actually adds some characteristic to the place.  The waiters and waitresses give you your food, water, check, boxed food...all on what seems to be a walk-by.  And I find it kind of impersonal but funny.  I'd probably be more disappointed if I was eating alone, but you don't really care when you have someone with you.  As it got later and the bar window moved to a different location, we found our spot to be rather peaceful.NOW, ON TO THE IMPORTANT PART...The food was amazing!  Clam chowder was thick and tasty with lots of grub in there.  And the Cioppino bowl (~$12) was yummy and enough to fill up a whole tummy.  We also got the swordfish with guacamole and it was cooked just right (~$23).  The bread they serve you while waiting is cold and a little tough, but the sourdough is still so yummy.  The total bill came to about $45 including tax + tip.  I would love to come here again.  It's great for a fun date.",4 star rating,Michelle L.

It was perfect day to be loving the Cali sunshine without the horrible heat and a nice cool breeze. Oh, the spoils of living in Cali! We sat outside on the balcony.This restaurant is located upstairs and was incredibly crowded. Granted it was a holiday but we were seated right away. We came for a late lunch. My friend and I got the Hot Combo Appetizer and the Fish and Chips to share. It was a good amount of food and I didn't feel guilty at all eating all this fresh seafood. :) The Hot Combo Appetizer is worth it at $15.45 and the Fish & Chips at $10.75. We were stuffed and I was also glad to get my carb fix with the complimentary sourdough bread. (Thank you for the free refills of bread. I'm such a carb-loving wh*re! I can't help it.) Now, one of the few things that bugged me was the sea hair that came with the mussels. I had to pull it out of several of them and my friend was just turned off by it. LOL And because it was so packed around the bar area it made the space between our table and the bar really narrow. I felt a little bad for the servers but at least they were really attentive and quick despite the lack of space. Now after all that food...where's the dessert? Well, sorry to say...there is NONE. :( I was so ready for something sweet and when I asked our server, he smiled and pointed to the alcohol. LOL Granted I would've flipped as the (slight :)) alki in me would, but I wanted something decadent served a la mode. Oh, well.

I wish they didn't cram so many tables in there, it's not a good place to bring kids because there just isn't enough room for a high chair! Outside seating is crammed too, and very loud. A good place to have a date night, the food isn't as good as it once was but still worth visiting.",4 star rating,Debi M.

5/21/2018,"Austin, TX","This restaurant is in a nice location at the Santa Barbara Harbor. The views are good and the atmosphere is very vibrant. It is popular; hence, there can be a lot of noise. We found it difficult to have a conversation because of the noise, but we enjoyed the atmosphere nevertheless. The food was very good, especially the clam chowder. It was probably the best clam chowder that I have ever had. There were lots of clam pieces. The chowder had a lot of solid ingredients. The texture was great. The flavor was outstanding. I would come back solely for the clam chowder. We also had mahi mahi, sea bass, and a seafood pasta dish between the three of us. We were all satisfied with our dishes. We would recommend fewer noodles and more seafood in the pasta dish, but it was still a good dish. The service was fairly good and reasonably attentive. The prices were also reasonable. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and will return. I recommend this place.",4 star rating,Steven B.

I'm pretty sure that as soon as I hit the ""Post"" button, this review will automatically get vacuumed into a black hole and spiral down a vortex of banality, never to be seen again.As the 1115th reviewer, I am most likely not contributing any new, mind-blowing information that hasn't already been repeatedly said, which means you're forced to read yet another review about clam chowdah (surprise, surprise).

Everything I look for in this soup was present: good quality/quantity of clams (loads of fresh, hearty chunks of meat), good consistency (not overly creamy or chunky), nice ratio of potatoes to clams (no filler 'taters here), nice mix of spices (tasty kicks of flavor without being too salty).The clam chowder alone is enough reason to check out Brophy Bros.

It was STILL amazing! The service down to the hostess to the bartenders to the waiters= 100%.  I def. recommend starting with the clam chowder and basically for your main course you can't go wrong with any of their seafood dishes!!

9/25/2012,"Morris County, NJ","We stopped by here and asked for a table, knowing that the restaurant does not take reservations. We were told it would take an hour. We figured that we would wait, knowing that by the time we found another restaurant, it would be an hour anyway. After waiting an hour, I went to the hostess stand and asked about the table. I was told that it it would be another 20 minutes. After waiting an hour and half, I went back to the hostess stand and was told that it would be another 10 minutes or so. Since we had already been misled by them and did not trust them, we left.This is a very unethical way to treat your customers. If you are going to make your customers wait almost two hours for a table, be honest and upfront with them.I also had another problem with them. In order to get one of those buzzers that tell you when your table is ready, you have to give them some type of ID. In this age of identity theft, we were very reluctant to give it to someone. Fortunately I had an ID on me that had a limited amount of information on it that they accepted. My gut feeling is that so many people have gotten frustrated with the waits that they either walked away with those buzzers or threw them into the bay.This story does have a happy ending. We went to another restaurant and had some of the best fish that we had on our trip. We would not have wound up there if it have not been for the dishonest conduct of Brophy's employees.10/19/2012I must have hit a nerve with someone named Bill L. from Buffalo NY.

Good quality seafood, just cooked in a slightly outdated way, but still delicious and offers an enjoyable experience. Must haves: oyster shooters (with vodka), fresh oysters and garlic clams (buttery and delicious).  We also had the clam chowder which was just ok. Unfortunately they didn't have dessert but they do have a killer ghost chili pepper margarita that is unique and hard to put down. The best part of the restaurant is the view! We were on the upper back patio and had a beautiful view of the harbor at night. The harbor was filled with boats and so tranquil.

In spite of being after 1:00 pm on a Monday, the wait was 30 minutes - but it worked out well, as we got a nice spot on the upstairs balcony on a beautiful, if breezy, day. Two of us had Fish and Chips. It was done with Swai - I prefer cod - but was excellent in any event. Batter was just right, proper degree of crispness. Another (from New York) had Mahi Mahi with tropical fruit sauce, which he'd never heard of but liked. Fourth party had a bowl of clam Chowder and seafood salad. She's from CT, but liked the chowder very much. NY guy said a place in Boston is best, and I don't dispute that.Prices are reasonable and you can't beat the scenery (NY visitor was showing signs of 'Hmm, maybe this would be a good place to retire.'

It's actually pretty nice coming around sunset to sit on the outdoor balcony area overlooking the Santa Barbara Harbor.When we were seated, we received complimentary bread and got a few cups of clam chowder for starters. The hype & titles for best chowder in town are definitely legitimate.

They have a smaller restaurant downstairs where you can get small plates and drinks, which is a good place to wait or a good option if you're not looking for a big main course. Also, On The Alley is a good option nearby that offers quick service and cheaper options, but has some similar dishes such as chowder and fish and chips.

Not a big potato fan, but totally didnt mind it in their chowder. Crab cakes were good, had the perfect crispiness on the outside and was covered with a sauce that was delish.My second visit, the next night, I tried the baked garlic clams, and the fish and chips.

We were surprised and grateful to be seated so quickly and we got the best seat in the house with a view and outside. I enjoyed the ciopinno with white snapper, clams, muscles, and stew. It was amazing. Flavorful.  The clam chowder is one of the best, and I know my chowdas. Ahi poke was great too. Service was perfect, no comaints. Our server did a great job on sharing her input and answering our questions. .",5 star rating,Michelle G.
4/29/2016,"Lompoc, CA","It was good and very busy! I ordered the burger and chowder she ordered a shrimp cocktail. Serving timing to each table was odd. I got my chowder and we shared, then she got her shrimp cocktail. After she was almost done I got my burger. The table next to us was the same? One person was served and the others waited a good 10 minutes. I understand busy and respect that allot! I just felt uncomfortable starting my meal after she was half done. Kudos to our server who I tipped well and when I come back it will be because of her! Busy for a reason I am sure, but I did not catch it for my first visit. My bet is my follow up visit will bring a better review because that busy can not be that wrong!

6/25/2015,"Pinole, CA","I came here for lunch, not for dinner. As a place for appetizers & drinks, I think this place shines, but for a lunch meal, there is much better. The place is busy, even for lunch 2pm on a Monday, there was a wait for a table, & they were packed. We got seats outside, which I recommend if the weather is good. Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the menu & efficient. I never had to ask or flag her for anything. The cleaning guys were rushed and asked if you were done with a plate, after they already picked it up and veer walking away. I lost my bread plate & knife while eating a piece of bread. Here's the breakdown:Calamari- Outstanding (perfectly fried with mild spices, great sauces & the calamari was moist & tender.Clam Chowder- Decent, bland, but chalk full of clams.Garlic Baked Clams- Disappointing. Should be called garlic baked breadcrumbs over small raw clams. Only 6.The last dish was listed as a ""local favorite"". I lived in SB for 5 years in the late 90's. I don't remember that as a local favorite, but I did remember the clam chowder being much better. For a great meal, about same price- go to the Enterprise Fish Company and get a martini & a grilled fish plate.Come here for appetizers, beer and a sort of view.",3 star rating,Maus M.

3/24/2013,"San Jose, CA","This was a nice spot to enjoy some seafood and a view of the water. My husband and I went on a Fri night around 6 pm and waited about 15-20 minutes for a table outside. It was a little chilly that night so it was really nice that they had plastic coverings up and heat lamps. It was so warm when we sat down I didn't even need a jacket. They gave sourdough bread but it would have been better if it was warm and toasted. The clam chowder was great. Good flavor, lots of clams, and creamy but not overly so. My fish & chips were pretty tasty. The breading was crispy, not too thick and the fish inside was very tender. My husband got the seabass which I felt had a good flavor but was way too tough. Both our dishes came with some coleslaw which looked overly dressed but actually tasted pretty light. They add poppyseeds in their dressing which is interesting but you can't really taste it.The area is nice to walk around with views of the water, beach, and lots of ships. Parking is $2 and hour in the lot and if you get lucky there is the small parking area right in front of the maritime museum that is free for 90 minutes between 9 am - 6 pm and then unlimited after that. Downstairs they have a more casual bar version of their restaurant and there are a few other seafood places nearby.",3 star rating,Alice J.

11/15/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","After reading so many great reviews, I just had to drop in for dinner when I was in SB. The clam chowder was good, but I have had better. What makes this chowder stands out is the big pieces of clams, not itty bitty pieces. It is a bit salty though. I asked for the sour dough bread to be toasted, and it was devine eating crusty bread with the chowder. I also had the seafood pasta. It was okay as the sauce was flat in flavor. The seafood was fresh and abundan. The portion was huge as it includes a large order of fries and a salad. The service was friendly and they accommodate customers requests. I would have given a four star, but the flavor is a bit on the flat side.",3 star rating,LT K.

10/28/2014,"Santa Monica, CA","So I decided to take a day trip to Santa Barbara and looking at the ocean I suddenly have a hankering for some fresh seafood. So I looked up yelp and the closest seafood restaurant that pop up was the Brophy Brose restaurant. At first I thought the name was kind of silly but looking at the reviews and the pictures of the food it look like it had everything that I wanted. So I went for it and went to this place to try it out. The location is great it's literally right in front of the ocean we got there a little late so we had to sit at the top balcony of the restaurant which I did not mind because I had a great view of the ocean. But let's get down to what really matters I ordered the cold combo and was not disappointed everything was so fresh I also got the clam chowder which was delicious and fish and chips and which the fish was fried perfectly with the beer battered sauce. The service was amazing the really fast and attentive to our needs.and for all you frugal people out there the prices of this place was great, definitely cheaper than what I thought it would be.With everything being said food service speed and location I give this place a four out of five just a for the fact that when I went to this place I had previously torn my Achilles tendon and was on crutches and it was really hard to get up to the second floor because they had no elevator or wheelchair access to get up there.but all in all if you're around the city and want some really good cheap fast seafood with a really good location and great service I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back to Brophy Brothers whenever I'm in town.",4 star rating,Aaron G.

To start off with we had the clam chowder, which is really good. Then we had the baked garlic clams, which were also very good. It all goes down hill from there. The crab cakes are flavorless, and mostly breading. The coleslaw side didn't even taste like cabbage, never mind coleslaw. The rice was completely forgettable. Then there's the cioppino. All that can be said for it is the seafood is fresh. The shrimp were tiny and flavorless, but the muscles, clams, and fish were good.

Not skimpy on any of the seafood and potatoes were al dente not mushy! MmmMmm...Creamy, rich but not too thick and simply delicious. A bowl size is good for sharing between 2 peoples.

5/15/2012,"Pasadena, CA","I don't like giving 5 stars. I don't really even like giving 4 stars. And while there were no culinary masterpieces here (by that, I mean a dish to take things out of the box that we might consider extremely unique to the eyes or palette), everything was delightful to the last crumb. I'm writing a week after the experience to put it into perspective. Additionally, we had one particularly bad meal at another local restaurant (the Palace grill), that makes this meal stand out even more. So on to the food:For starters, we had the hot plate (it said it was a must, and the menu or specials page was so right). We haven't had mussels and clams and shrimp this fresh in California. It came on a bed of salt (don't try eating the salt :-)). The oyster-Rockefeller-like concoction was ok, but didn't show off the fruits of the sea as the other items did. Additionally for starters (came with our meals, thanks to our beautifully observant waitress who was not shy about telling us the real deal...  ) we had the clam chowder. I keep wanting to say chowda, not to offend my Beantown Brahman friends but to convey that this is the best I've had outside their fair city. I digress. Really go just for the chowder already!!!And on to the main courses: One sea bass and one swordfish. The sea bass wasof a Cajun/creole variety and better than anything from the palace grill or any other place recently. Frankly everything else on the plate was so subtle (the rice, the vegetables, etc) that it made this stand out so much. The rub was good, but a bit overpowering. The swordfish was easily the tastiest, juiciest, most flavor rich and air-like swordfish I've ever had. It was melt in your mouth, stick to your ribs, and good for you in each morsel. We had a little of the house wine too, but that was less than interesting, but it did make the food's character feel more Santa Barbaran. We're going back and ordering a week's worth of swordfish... But I imagine we should keep trying everything here.",5 star rating,Eli S.

We decided on this place mainly because it boasted a ""clam bar"" and all sorts of yummy seafood choices.After we were seated, my mom and I realized that we had been there a couple years before during lunch--it was crazy busy and we waited for a while....but this day we came right when it opened at 11am so we sat wherever we wanted!This place has so many great seafood choices: we ordered 2 hot combos which includes mussles, clams, baked clams, shrimp...etc etc all very fresh, piping, and tastyyyy. For the main dishes we tried the crab cakes, seafood pasta, and the seabass. all were very yummy- the crab cakes were delicious they gave 2 HUGE meaty cakes- they didn't skimp on the crab at all...and the sauce it came with was sooooo geeeewd.The seabass wasn't particularly astounding...but they give huge portions and so I was able to have it for another meal. The seafood pasta was overflowing with so much seafood. usually you wouldn't want to order pastas at a seafood place because its not worth it...but here they give you lots of seafood so it wasn't so bad.oh and how could i forget to mention their clam chowda???? Our entrees came with a cup of that good stuff and it was perfect- not too heavy and loaded with clams- just the way it should be. I know this is a very popular touristy place to hit up....but hey if they got the goods...i don't see why they shouldn't deserve the recognition they deserve!p.s. they have a bar which I might add was very full even at 11:30am.....so if any of y'all wanna enjoy a drink w/ ur meal and/or grab a seat during the lunch or dinner rush hour its a good choice!",5 star rating,Shening S.
8/11/2010,"Las Vegas, NV","This place was recommended to me by a colleague since I would be traveling to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  I convinced my friends to go here for dinner, so we arrived around 6 or 6:30 and proceeded to wait to be seated after the 10 parties ahead of us.We went downstairs after receiving a pager and giving up a debit card as collateral to an unfriendly hostess (apparently they have a lot of people walking off with pagers that are useless with any other system).  We waited probably about an hour or more to be seated (we were only a group of 3). Once we were seated, service was prompt and our server was attentive and much nicer than the hostess.  I ended up ordering the local white sea bass with a cup of clam chowder, cole slaw, and rice pilaf.  The clam chowder was good, but nothing extraordinary.  The fish was also good, but I would have rather had it without the aioli sauce.  The cole slaw was decent and there wasn't anything that stood out about the rice pilaf.  I should have ordered the seafood pasta.Basically, I thought the wait wasn't worth the mediocrity of the food.  The only thing I thought this place had going for it was the location -- the fact that it's at a harbor gives it a somewhat cooler atmosphere.  Otherwise, I don't get all the hype.",2 star rating,Margarita M.

There is a reason why this restaurant is always packed with people. Fresh food, great staff and a nice, casual vibe. When I'm up in Santa Barbara I always check out Brophy Bros.

8/15/2012,"Pasadena, CA","On one beautiful Saturday afternoon, my hubby and I met one of our favorite couple friends here for lunch. This place was very crowded, but fortunately our friends put their name down while they wait for us. The wait was supposedly to be 45 minutes, but I think the overall wait we had to get seated was 30 - 35 minutes, more or less. In any case. it was within the length of time she quoted our friend. As it was very busy, inside is very noisy. Fortunately, we were seated upstairs at their outside patio so it was not nearly crazy loud. It was actually very pleasant to be able to hear each other athe same time enjoy the beautiful weather in SB that day. We all ordered their fish and chips entree. Our friends had beer while I had a bloody mary. My hubby had the clam chowder. There was nothing special on their chowder, but the fish and chips was definitely fresh, tasty and perfectly battered! This alone is a reason for me to come back again. No need to go back to Mac's at State St. where quality has been compromised. Brophy Bros. has it all for a nice sit-down lunch with friends - atmosphere, location and good food. As far as for service, I can't really complain. Our server was polite and considering that this place was packed she managed to be pleasant and serving. I would definitely come back again, but I will venture to try other dishes as well.",4 star rating,Lizza M.
7/15/2012,"Huntington Beach, CA","Supposedly voted best seafood in Santa Barbara by the locals for the past 13 years. Cool place and cool ambiance overlooking the water but the food was just ok. Had calamari and the steamers with a bowl of chowder for starters and had the sea bass for a meal. Calamari was a bit over beaded and the cocktail sauce was very average. Kinda tasted just like ketchup. Steamers were good but not too exciting. Chowder was also good and had no fishiness or grittiness you sometimes can get but it also lacked flavor. The sea bass was blackened which I like but it was a little overcooked and dry in my opinion. Other than that, the staff was awesome and very friendly and we really didn't wait too long for a table on a busy Sunday afternoon. I want to give it 3.5 stars but its not an option and the food really wasn't that impressive. I like hole in the wall places that don't go over the top with garnishes and all that but I would have liked better tasting food.",3 star rating,Matt G.
10/14/2015,"Montecito, CA",I love Brophy Bros. In fact I crave the food there. When it is date time with my fiance we go there because of the great food and atmosphere. We never have to wait more than 20 min for a seat and we prefer to sit outside. The staff is excellent and make sure your food is hot and fresh and drinks come out of no where when your empty. I wish it was a secret so we had it to ourselves but the secret is out. A must try is the clam chowder. Hands down the best anywhere especially if you spice it up with hot sauce and I almost forgot the fresh bread.. In fact as I'm typing I'm figuring out how to make time to go there today.,5 star rating,Barret M.
2/27/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Came here on a Monday afternoon around 2 pm, no wait when we came thankfully, although the restaurant was definitely busy for that time on a Monday afternoon! We came looking for tasty seafood on a visit up from LA and boy, we were not disappointed! The service was prompt, and friendly. We were seated right away and brought a basket of bread and butter. After a long morning of driving and sight-seeing we were all hungry and they brought us more bread immediately when they saw the basket was empty. The menu had too many delicious things to choose from and it took a few minutes to decide but our waitress was very patient and sweet, even when my boyfriends mother had several dietary modifications that needed to be made to the dish she picked. My boyfriend and I shared the New England Clam Chowder and the plate of clam strips and I have only one thing to say- Delicious! I haven't had better since I was in New England. The clam strips were crispy and flavorful and the chowder was creamy and rich with plenty of clams, if I hadn't been staring out the window looking directly at the Santa Barbara Harbor I could have sworn I was in Massachusetts or Connecticut. Yum! His moms fried scallops were nice and meaty, fried to perfection, her fried fish was flaky and buttery, and even the cole slaw was yummy! We all left happy and full,and his mom (who really only eats New England food) was satisfied at last. I would have to say it was some of the best sea food I have had in California and paired with the fresh sea breezes blowing through the windows and the beautiful view of the ocean I would say it was well worth the trip down to the harbor. I would definitely come back for dinner sometime and try some of the fancier dishes, and if I'm ever craving seafood, I know where to go!",5 star rating,Kira M.
7/27/2015,"Bakersfield, CA","Can't hardly wait to go back to this place, even though we ate there just two days ago, and if you have to wait, I'm sorry, but great food takes time and you will be rewarded if you come with that in mind.  I have been dying for some crispy fried oysters, which are not on the menu, but when I asked our waitress she said she would ask the chef and was successful so I ordered them and they were perfect in every way, hot-crispy and obviously very fresh and we treasured them; no wonder pearls come from oysters.  Don't even get me started on the amazingly flavorful, and chunky clam laden chowder, also prepared by master chefs that spend time to bring this awesome favorite to the table and if you like fish, this is the best place to get fish fit for a king, and in our case a queen and a princess.   Can't hardly wait to return to Brophy Brothers, there's just nothing like it....",5 star rating,Glenn P.

3/30/2017,"Temecula, CA","Stopped at Brophys for our first meal on our Santa Barbara weekend. There is paid parking--and they do not validate (found that unusual). Hoppled on a broken ankle and crutches to the entrance to discover there is only stairs--no elevator. bummer--but I was determined to eat here and sit looking at the harbor. So up I hopped. Only to find out once I made the top (Im 53 and slightly chubby but still did it!! yay me)...the bathroom is all the way downstarirs and around the corner. BLAH. jokes on me! We had a friendly enough waitress (accidentally thought my daughter's boyfriend was a girl, long hair) haha.  We ordered clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, calamari, and seafood pasta, and one infamous spicy oyster shot, specifically because of Yelp reviews. Clam Chowder gets a 10/10!!!  Only place the has ever beat it for me is in Monterey. Calamari 7/10. Very tender--but also greasy and not as crispy as I personally prefer...still enjoyable though! Shrimp cocktail--naturally would've preferrred 7 prawns then just 5, especially for the high price.  Seafood Pasta 8/10--garlic yumminess but definitely overkill on all the tomatoes---still enjoyable.  Glad we stopped by and had the experience...the hopple was worth it one time, but won't make the ""hop"" again lol, I'll wait till I can walk up the stairs.",4 star rating,dl c.

3/19/2012,"Brooklyn, NY","I usually don't write about negative experiences, but I feel the need to since the 4 star over all rating is very misleading.This is a bar with bar-quality and bar-style seafood. During my experience, the food (with the exception of the oysters and fish'n'chips) was not particularly fresh or well prepared. The shrimp tasted off. The oysters shooters might as well be called cocktail-sauce shooters since that is mostly what is in them (and the sauce is not very good, too cold and lumpy). The clam chowder is essentially potato chowder with a clam garnish (although it was a decent potato chowder). And the blackened swordfish I got for an entree? Biggest waste of $24 ever. Very very overcooked and the fry and slaw sides were just sad.I have no idea why this place is so popular, but I feel no need to pay for parking (unlike the rest of SB), wait ages for a table, and then suffer through mediocre seafood ever again. I'll be over at Hungry Cat or Julienne enjoying well-cooked, fresh seafood next time.",2 star rating,Cara S.

So we waited in the bar downstairs to order drinks and appetizers. The drinks were great but the bartender forgot to order our appetizers. We asked her about it at 8:15 so by the time we got our appetizers at 8:30 our children were starving. We were seated as a party of four at a super-teeny table in the middle of the extremely busy and noisy restaurant. The table never would've even held all of our plates. At this point we were so done that we ordered all the food to go. When we got back to our hotel, our orders were completely wrong. Of note, the coleslaw is the same exact coleslaw as KFC.

5/9/2012,"San Luis Obispo, CA","So, this is my ninth review using the ""Same Boat"" method.  I am in the industry and loathe Yelp reviews.  They are moody positive or negative - written in the heat of the moment, rarely true for more than the reviewer's experience. So here I go! Brophy Brother's is a no brainer for a good review.  It is one of my go to places in SB to visit because it is consistently good. But let's see how it fairs with the ""Same Boat"" method.My reviews are going to give stars based on:1- Service - good or bad?2- Cleanliness - your table, any view of the kitchen and the bathroom - are they good?3- Food quality - was this place what you expected or better? Give a star.4- Pricing - was the food/wine worth the price? Come on, we are all foodies, but did they do something that was worth the price of $10 or $100?5 - I am saving this star for the experience - was it exceptional?Service - consistently good. I love being on the deck and the only complaint I have is that they do not line up the tables so people can sit comfy - not the server's fault, but I would look to see if anyone over age six could sit there and breathe and eat.  Service though, always friendly, and anyone will help you.  Good stuff.Cleanliness - Clean, neat - all the tables were wiped and the condiments were clean.  Bathrooms are weird here, I think they are just public, but they are not dirty. +1 Star!Food quality - I eat small when I am here because it's pricey. It's always worth it, but as I said, I am in the food industry, so I am no rich person.  Food quality is delish - had the baked clams and a bloody mary, definitely will have again.Pricing - small amounts, but fresh and delish - nothing frozen here. Exceptional - I love Brophy Brothers.  Are they exceptional? Not for me. The seating is weird. It makes it so overall I am not comfy. Great view, weirdly placed bar and the seats too close. The food, drinks, service and view outweigh the discomfort and I will be back :)",4 star rating,Restaurant L.

The crab meat was delicious and although I'm not a huge ceviche fan, this one was pretty good (my bf loved it). Peel and eat shrimp was what you'd expect, all of the steamed food was delicious and the baked clams were amazing. We also had a few oyster shooters which were SPICY but great!

We showed up for dinner and although it was very crowded, we were able to grab a seat at the bar. Not overly fancy, but come dressed in good looking casual clothing so you don't feel out of place.My evening at Brophy Bros was filled with firsts. I had a Bloody Mary for the first time and all I can say, is that if you like your drinks made with clam juice so it tastes like the ocean..this place has you covered. Personally, I don't think I am a Bloody Mary person in general. :( We ended the night with oyster shooters. A girlfriend and I decided to be adventurous and with some encouragement of the other bar patrons and the bartender, we downed them like champs and turns out they were absolutely delicious!

4/14/2012,"San Jose, CA","Place is loud and busy place on any time of the day. But, we were quite satisfied with our food and service.First, the waiter brings:1. Bread - it's not warm, but it's good. it's refillable and comes with butter. the bread will come in handy if you order the cioppino!!Then we ordered:Crab Cakes - delicious crab cakes, i loved it, it comes with 2 good sized crab cakes, a side of cole slaw (i'd pass it) , and fries. For 3 of us, we downed it and was quite satisfied. The crab cakes were pan fried to perfection, with real crab bits and the crispy edges made it so tasty . I dont even remember the sauce, so that probably means the crab cakes were flavorful enough for me to even want to ruin the taste. would i order this again? yes. oh yes. fried scallops appetizer - these were delicious. i like it better with the red sauce over the tartar sauce. It was crunchy and crispy yet not too bready that you couldn't taste the scallop. I'm not a huge fan of scallop , but this dish was quite good. i liked how they gave you lots of it too. it was small chunky little scallops. house salad - alright. forgettable. i dont even remember after eating those 2 above. CIOPPINO. - my favorite. i had this the first time in Santa Cruz, CA. now, this version is a bit different, they added parmesean cheese and fish. not alot of squid (my favorite) or clams. It was a good sized portion  but i don't think the price matched for what its worth. The soup was warm on a rainy day and if you dip the free bread into your soup. it makes it 100000xxxxxxxxxxxx better. sometimes, i like to add tapitio sauce for a kick. i love cioppino, but i have to say that i've had the best one in santa cruz, ca so far. I'm not a fan of cheese in my soup, so i'll ask for no cheese next time. other than that..it was good, but not worth the price. and i wish they added squid or calamari into the mix.Our bill came out to be 60+ but the waiter was nice . he came around a couple o times and refilled our bread.",4 star rating,Julie Z.

2/17/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Went to brophys on 2/15/14. Took a mini trip to santa barbra and wanted some good seafood with a view. Yelped seafood and brophys came up. Arrived there around 1:30pm. The wait was 1hr.  So we went downstairs and found a seat at the bar. Ordered the clam chowder and the calamari. Calamari was good but wished it was a little bit warmer. Clam chowder was awesome and very rich in flavor. Ordered a mimosa for the girl and a ipa for myself. Food came out quick and the server even hooked up a mimosa for free, awesome. Also had a bloody mary. Straight up not to fancy with 2 olives! oh and the bread they give you was chewy on the outside and warm and soft in the middle. Bill came out to around $45.00 tip $10.00 for the speedy service and the waitress and bartender were very friendly. 40 mind passed and the pager went off. Was seated on the balcony looking over the docks. Ordered the seafood cold sampler and the seafood pasta. Cold platter had 2 oysters half shell, 2 clams half shell, good amount of ceviche, crab meat and shrip. The seafood pasta had a good portion of shrimp and scallop. The sauce was excellent and endless fresh bread. Total for 5 mimosas, beer, bloody mary, seafood sampler and the pasta came out to around $110.00 with tip included. Would recommend it to my friends and family.",5 star rating,Scott L.

1/16/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Came for dinner during a recent weekend in Santa Barbara.  I had read a few travel articles mentioning this place and it had gotten decent Yelp reviews (which worries me btw). We were looking forward to some casual, roll your up sleeves kind of fresh seafood after a day of wine tasting in Santa Ynez.  After scanning the menu, we decided to go all appetizers. Big mistake. (in Julia Robert's voice). We ordered: -fried calamari (mediocre and not very crispy)-shrimp and avocado salad (mediocre)-some clam chowder (good)-steamed clams (VERY rubbery and tasted like they had been sitting for awhile)-a dozen oysters on the half shell (did NOT taste fresh AT ALL and had a troubling aftertaste)We sat outside on the deck which had a nice harbor view.  Unfortunately next to us at the bar was every frat brother in Santa Barbara ""bro""-ing away their Saturday night.  I had to actually shield my tartar sauce from touching some random guy's ass standing next to us in the aisle doing shots with his buddies.  To make matters worse, our waitress brought every thing within 10 minutes of each other literally piling plates on top of plates, not caring that we were on a tiny two top table, or not bothering to ask what we wanted first or when to bring out the other items.We downed our not very cold beers and got the F outta there, leaving the clams, calamari and oysters virtually untouched, feeling a bit annoyed we had thrown away $75 at another shitty tourist trap our first night in town.  I felt embarrassed for recommending this place.Maybe we should have ordered the fresh fish items instead???Bottom line: this less than fantastic experience was the impetus for splurging on some good seafood at the Four Seasons Sunday Brunch the next day :)  If it weren't for that place, Los Agaves, La Super Rica and Jeannine's, I would not have any good dining memories in this town.",1 star rating,HipGal M.

The hot appetizer combo was good and reasonably priced. The shrimps were cooked perfect. The fish and chips were OK, and extra star because the basa was fresh and not frozen. The cole slaw could use a little more seasoning.",4 star rating,Frances L.

The GBC's were amazingly rich - all you need is one, maybe two.For the main course, I got crab cakes.  Not bad, but nothing mind blowing.I'd go here again, but since I'm a visitor, I'd probably also look to find a different / new spot to try.  Regardless, if you haven't been, I'd certainly recommend it.  Get the GBC's!",4 star rating,Joshua S.

9/4/2012,"Walnut, CA","Came here for labor day family lunch.  Waited 2 hours for this on top of our 2 1/2 hour car ride.. so by the time we were seated.. I was more than ready to eat.We placed our orders and the food was pretty slow to come out.. but like most dining experiences.. it EVENTUALLY came out and this is how it came down:1. Fish and chips: My god.. these were the best pieces of fried fish I've ever had.  Super hot right out of the fryer!   But the french fries were so not good.  I don't know how you mess up french fries.. but somehow they did it.2. Clam chowder: Really hearty and generous with the amount of clams in the soup, but I didn't really enjoy it.  I prefer it a little more soupier.. and richer in flavor.3. Garlic Baked Clams:  I didn't expect this dish to look the way it did.  I thought it would be clams sitting in a bed of garlic broth.. but these were literally 6 giant clams baked individually in their shell with bread crumbs, garlic and bacon.  Wow.. this was my favorite.  Definitely try this.  I believe it is their speciality. 4. Sea Bass:  Not a big fan of the cajun seasoning... but the fish tasted fresh!5. Crabcakes: Don't order these.  They used snowcrab to make them.. and I think that doesn't produce a good tasting crabcake.  Too much breading to hold the cakes together.. not good.6.  Calamari: I've definitely had better calamari.  These were just.. meh. Not a fan.7. Raw Oysters:  I don't eat these.. but they didn't look too fresh.  My dad who is the oyster master confirmed my guess.  All in all.. some hits and misses.  The hits were really dead on, while the misses were a big miss.  Another big miss was the service.  Our server was one of those ""take your order and disappear until bill time"" types.  Our waters remained empty for the course of our meal.  I think just come for the food and don't expect stellar service.  It's more of a casual restaurant in my opinion so treat it as such.  Know what's good, come on a day that isn't the weekend or a holiday.. and I think you will have a better time than I did.",3 star rating,Wendy C.

Clam Chowder - It was nice and creamy and and a good amount of clams.Seafood Spagetti - This was a really good addition to our meal. There was a good amount of seafood in it and they tossed it with tomatoes and garlic. Fried Clams - It was a good appetizer. The clams were really long. The View excellent and by the time we were finished to leave, there was a big line already. good thing we got there early.

1/24/2012,"Berkeley, CA","A Santa Barbara institution with locals and tourists alike. The view of the harbor and mountains make a magnificent backdrop and the smell of the ocean air, combined with delicious seafood makes this one of my favorite SB restaurants.  I lived in SB for 22 years and went there weekly. My favorite spot is sitting at the bar, ordering off the small clam bar menu (although you can order off the full menu as well). My favorite bartenders are Ara and Adam, who I have known for years... I highly recommend the bloody marys. I typically get the hot combo (garlic baked clams, oysters rockefeller, beer boiled shrimp, and steamed clams/mussels). Let me tell you that the garlic baked clams are to DIE FOR! Other favs are the Brophy burger, tuna melt, steamed mussels and clams and the seafood pasta (off the regular menu). You MUST get the cioppino on a cold winter day.Weekends are packed so it's best to come in a smaller group so you can snag a seat at the bar (if there are people sitting next to a single empty seat, you can politely ask them to do the ""Brophy Shuffle"" e.g. move down a seat so you and your friend can sit next to each other- this happens all the time). Ara and Adam usually give me the heads up when I can expect a bar seat to open up so I get lucky quite often. It's a bustling place and very popular, especially on the weekend afternoons.

6/29/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","HORRENDOUS. I'm so sorry to feel the need to write this e-mail and address the issues we experienced tonight, since I have NEVER had a dining experience where I've felt the need to point out the horrendous parts of my evening. I've worked in the service industry since I was 14, I know how things work, and how my mother and I were treated tonight is the opposite of how you do things. To start, Your food is on the par of an Applebees on a good day. The oysters Rockefeller, which you claim as a specialty, is a gooey mess. It's poorly prepared, warmed up, and all around lacks freshness and flavor. Your floor plan for your servers lacks flow, which in turn contributed to poor service as our server ran around and was rarely present to address our needs for the evening. A miscommunication occurred, could not find our server, when we finally did she gave some sorry excuse to make it better, which she didn't follow through with; as I expect as a fear to approach the manager. When the manager approached, she lacked any type of communicative skills. ""what's going on?"" was her question, not how can we fix a problem. She was on the defense and not equipped with the right skills to properly address a problem. She stated, ""honestly, what you got is way better than what you want anyways"". So....you want to bring out again the dish that's been out and back into the kitchen to our table again, that originally looked like a frozen fish steak? I think I'm good....All around, the biggest disappointment in Santa Barbara.",1 star rating,Katia D.

I could live with that. So my pasta came, the flavor was good but not amazingly WOW like I was expecting (I think I seriously had too much expectation on this place and it kind of ruined the experience).  The dish was filled with pasta with very little seafood.I then wondered where my coleslaw and french fries were (supposed to come with my entrée)?  I asked the waitress and she said ""I already told you your dish didn't come with anything"" and walked away... NO!! She told me it didn't come with pilaf but said nothing about my coleslaw and french fries... and if it didn't come with anything, why was the clam chowder served to me?  And why was this even listed under the same section as the other items that included the sides?Well.. nothing can be done at that point.  But I sure felt disappointed because I felt deceived by the menu.",2 star rating,syrus f.

10/10/2011,"Oceanside, CA","Out of all the Seafood Restaurants with an ocean view all of the reviews on yelp say to come to Brophy Bros. for a fresh and delicious seafood dinner.Wait for a Thursday night was 15 minutes, but with the view of the harbor and a quaint little gift shop downstairs, time flew by.  The restaurant is located on pier on the 2nd floor of a building.  There is an upstairs terrace with couples seating and the rest of the interior includes a large full bar and tables for couples and groups.  The atmosphere was loud and seemed like a lot of locals were there (good sign if you ask me).My wife and I were set before we even saw the menu on sharing a bowl of clam chowder with our meals, but when we read the menu we were pleased to see that each entree came with its own cup of clam chowder.  I had the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna with rice pilaf and coleslaw. The ahi was cooked medium and it was up to par.  The fish was crusted in some some sort of nut (macadamia I believe).  My wife had the seafood skewer which included a piece of salmon about 2/3 the size of my ahi, 1 huge scallop, and 2 big shrimp.  The skewer came with rice pilaf, coleslaw and a side of ginger teriyaki sauce for dipping.  My wife was pretty stuffed from our lunch earlier in the day so she shared most of her meal with me.  The shrimp was meaty and paired well with the sauce.  The scallop was seared on both sides, but still tasted pretty raw inside.  The salmon was flaky and also paired well with the teriyaki.  The service was attentive and our waitress checked up on us a few times to make sure we were doing okay.  As soon as we were done eating our plates were cleared.  To sum it up Brophy Bros. is a fun restaurant that immerses you into the seafood culture that defines Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Bryan T.

9/28/2011,"Long Beach, CA","Don't expect a 'fancy' restaurant, because it's not. It's upstairs in an older building at the end of the Harbor, a nice venue for a great seafood place. The views of the Harbor, Stearns Wharf and the Riviera add to the overall enjoyment. The tables on the porch give you the best views. The food and service are terrific. I usually get the swordfish. It's a fresh generous portion, tender and full of flavor. The fish dishes are prepared with different sauces but I always ask for salt & pepper only. I think sauces take away from the flavor of the fish.                                                             Their New England clam chowder is thick, creamy and delicious with just the right combination of ingredients. The coffee is suprisingly good too. A good thing to know, if someone in your group doesn't like seafood, their cheeseburger might be the best in town. Very good.You can check out their menu on line. Dinners are $20+ but well worth it. They don't skimp on the quality or quantity plus the servers and bussers don't give you a chance to run out of drinks, coffee, bread or anything. They're right on top of things. Enjoy",5 star rating,Danny O.

The Cold sampler platter and fish & chips.Disclaimer: I tip cash for both eating in and take out so workers can pocket the tip for themselves. I got my check before my food was finished to be packed up to go and as soon as the waiter behind the oyster bar packed my food, he looked at the merchant receipt and it said $0 tip. He looked at the check and seemed very unpleasantly surprised. (i don't blame you but don't act like a INSTA-ASSHOLE cuz you don't know what would have come next. you lack professionalism.) I asked for tobasco sauce and he said they don't have it to go but I asked for it in a little container right behind him and he seemed very annoyed. Thereafter filling it, he then tossed the closed container towards me very rudely and walked away. At least ""toss"" it in the bag.I wasn't given any utensils or napkins. I asked the female hostess politely for wet napkins, she was nice enough to grab them for me. I still had no utensils.Yeah, no cash tip for you, ASSHOLE. As far as the food review goes, I lost my appetite after such rude service. The fish and chips had terrible batter, it got soggy after 5 minutes being in it's container.Can't go wrong with the oysters and clams cuz mother nature made those.

12/15/2011,"Pasadena, CA","I have mixed feelings about this place.  The best part about this place is that if you order any of their entrees, you get a choice of either fries or cup of clam chowder on the side.  Needless to say, the clam chowder is the way to go.  It was a really hearty clam chowder with lots of clams and potatoes, and not very heavy on the bacon unlike a lot of places on the west coast.  That was probably the best part of the meal.  Now onto the entree.  I ordered the sea bass, which I expected to be very flaky and juicy.  When I got it, it was grilled on all 4 sides.  To my knowledge, sea bass shouldn't taste dry whatsoever.  However, this entree did taste rather dry.  It came with a small cup of garlic butter, but honestly, you really shouldn't need to use it on sea bass if it's done right.  So in conclusion, the side dish on the entree ended up being more impressive than the main dish.Also, I wasn't a big fan of the restaurant's waiting policy.  Rather than having people wait downstairs, there were people standing around in the already crowded dining area.  People were loud, and many of them drunk, standing next to your table while you're trying to get in a quick meal for the day.  There should be no reason why the restaurant should be allowing people to stand around in the dining area waiting for a table.  This is a pretty big issue that definitely made the dining experience less than satisfactory.",3 star rating,E Y.

9/2/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","So somehow you've gotten wind that Brophy Bros. is ""the place to go"" for a waterfront seafood meal in Santa Barbara. Now you're cross-checking reviews, and you're probably bewildered by the mixed comments. You might be thinking to yourself, ""I have heard such great things about it, but the reviews aren't that compelling... should I try it anyway? I don't want to miss out on a great dining experience, but I don't want to end up feeling underwhelmed and disappointed either..."" Let me alleviate your inner torment by assuring you it is, indeed, a total rip-off.For $25 bucks a plate you'd think they would encourage a finer dining atmosphere, but it's loud, crowded, and the service feels like the rushed service you would expect from a cheap greasy-spoon diner.The food is mediocre at best. I started with a side salad which consisted of mixed greens. It was not actually a salad. It was literally lettuce on a plate. For an entree I had the grilled salmon, which was totally bland and tasted less inspired than what I make at home after work on a Monday night. My boyfriend, not being a seafood lover, ordered one of the only non-seafood items on the menu: a cheeseburger. He ordered it medium, but it came more-than-well-done; it was essentially a dry, tasteless, briquette on a bun with some pallid fixings on the side. I honestly felt bad for the animals that gave their lives to create our meal. And I don't know how the management can look at the food coming out of the kitchen and not feel terrible about charging such exorbitant prices for sub-sub-par food.That said, the clam chowder and Oysters Rockefeller are decent. If you must visit Brophy's, I would suggest going for a quick appetizer and a beer at the bar.

If you want bland flavorless fish with an ordinary side of rice pilaf and 2 huge scoops of slimy cole slaw, then by all means this is your place. Clam chowder was decent, but by no means memorable. The only reason this place has soooo many yelp reviews is because it's a touristy place with great atmosphere and a good view of the wharf. Put it anywhere else and you'd see a lot more 2-3 star reviews.",2 star rating,matt V.

10/12/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I'm a born and raised Santa Barbaran and for those visiting, it's definitely the place to go if you want seafood and a great atmosphere.  It's always full, no matter what night and expect a 15-30 minute wait, but you can go for a walk while waiting or have a drink.  The food is awesome although I generally go for the a la carte items.  Their best in my opinion are:Oysters Rockafeller - best I've had at any restaurant. Always get them. Beer boiled shrimpOyster ShootersBaked climbsCalamari - they are known for their calamari.The staff is always great and usually cute girls. Prices are good and the view of the harbor is awesome. I suggest you ask to wait for an outside table for better views and a bit less crowding although you won't have a ton of elbow room wherever you sit.

It was ridiculously packed (a good sign) - It took about 45 min to get a table out on the balcony and even so out food came out pretty fast!

1/14/2016,"Carroll Park, PA","The service was spot on, the view was great and I loved the decor of the place but really that's not why I gave the place 5 stars. I'm going to get a little off a reviewing track with the story that unfolded in front of us as we waited on our food and during our meal. A man was sat at the table behind us and was very friendly to the waitress, telling her a story and a few jokes before admitting he did not have a lot of money and asked if they take EBT cards. She was unsure so she went to the a manager and when he came over he spoke to the man for some time. All kind words. The man was getting ready to leave when the manager asked him to sit down and he would be right back. He came back with a big bowl of soup and extra bread and said, don't worry about it just enjoy your meal it's on the house. I have to say I was impressed by the compassion shown because he did not have to do anything for the man. He could of just asked him to leave. He was not going to write a review or demand a refund. He was simply a hungry man and a little compassion goes a long way in a hard world. This all happened and ended before we finished our meal. But now onto the review. The clam chowder was amazing. I should of just gotten a big bowl of it. It was not too thick and had just the right amount of everything. But I was a little less impressed by the fish and chips. The chips were very good and the sauces. But the fried fish was just ok and lacked flavor. The coleslaw was also lacking in flavor. My girlfriends seafood pasta was better but a little to oily. I would give the service 5 stars and the food 3. But try the clam chowder with the sour dough bread. It's very good.",5 star rating,Mark K.

6/6/2011,"San Diego, CA","Damn, the wait here is ridiculous but that's because this place is known for its view of the marina and the fresh seafood. Like most of Santa Barbara the dress code is casual and portions are huge. This past weekends dinner included:Brophy Oyster Shooter ($3.00) - You get one freshly shucked oyster topped with horseradish, cocktail sauce, lemon juice, Tabasco sauce and grated Parmesan cheese. The heat and tangy flavors of the oyster and the Parmesan adds a nutty richness. Spicy with a kick that I like.New England Clam Chowder ($7.00) - The bowl of chowder has a nice balance of clams and potatoes and the right amount of creaminess. It's fresh, hearty and comforting. It's not the best bowl of clam chowder, but it is more than satisfying.Grilled Salmon Salad with Avocado ($12.00) - The Grilled salmon salad was a really good filet, tender to the cut and juicy but the salad was not as impressive as the salmon. Not bad, just a simple green salad with grape tomatoes, onions, ice berg lettuce, and olives.Overall, the atmosphere is relaxing, the prices are reasonable and the location is unbeatable.",4 star rating,Craig R.

6/3/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","I went here for dinner around 7:00pm and the wait time was 45 minutes to 1 hour. The long wait just shows how popular this joint is. The overall wait was not bad at all especially since the restaurant is located right next to the harbor. The view is amazing around sunset but I recommend you bring a jacket. Waiting outside by the harbor gets chilly.Atmosphere: Casual and noise level was very loud but since there's a bar located right below and above, I can tell why but that means that speaking to someone sitting right next to you could sound more like an argument.Service: The servers were all very nice. The waitress always came by to check on the table and to refill our waters. Another server was also very nice when we asked her to break our bills. I ordered the seafood pasta which came with a cup of clam chowder. The chowder was delicious. It was creamy and loaded with seafood goodness. I LOVE clam chowder so if it passes my taste buds, it should do wonders for yours. Also, the complimentary bread went well with the soup. A cup of clam chowder costs $4.50. It's a little pricey but worth it.The pasta, on the other hand, was decent. However, it was a very big portion for ~$17. (Also came with cole slaw and fries). Order this dish if you're a big fan of garlic. I left dinner with garlic breath. Also, the bottom of the pasta has seafood sauce so make sure you mix the pasta.",4 star rating,Vanessa N.

8/6/2010,"Playa del Rey, CA","Brophy Brothers sits on the second floor of a building right on the pier in Santa Barbara.  The inside is crowded and lively.  Take away some of the seaside decor and the atmosphere kind of reminded me of Uncle Bill's Pancake House in Manhattan Beach--tables crammed together, boisterous people, noisy kitchen/plates, etc.The outside patio (on a sunny day) provides a great view.  On a not-so-sunny day, the gloomy light coupled with strong smells from the ocean provides a less than inviting atmosphere.Brophy Brothers makes a pretty decent New England clam chowder.  Served in a mug or bowl, the chowder was hot, creamy and flavorful.  The portion of clams was generous.  The chowder was garnished with parsley and oyster crackers.The complimentary bread--a thick and crusty sourdough--was also quite good.The entrees were below average, but I wonder if we just ordered wrong.  The batter for the fish (in the fish and chips) was not a good beer batter but an orangish and less crisp batter.  The fries were nothing special.We also tried the seafood pasta, which consisted of linguini, shrimp, bay scallops, and a cream sauce.  The shrimp was the best part.  The bay scallops were rubbery.  The linguini was quite clumpy.  It was also kind of a bland dish.  The dish was also kind of clumsily put together on the plate.Service was friendly and good.There was a good mix of prices from some reasonably priced lunch-like options such as cheeseburgers, fried fish, chicken sandwiches to more expensive seafood entrees like ahi and halibut.  If I came back, I think I would like to try one of their seafood entrees, but I wonder (based on some of the food we had) if their more expensive options would be mediocre and thus very overpriced.Brophy Brothers has a pretty lively atmosphere and I imagine there might be a few go-to items here.  If you can find those go-to items here, you may want to stick with them because this place did feel like one of those on the water places where it is more about the atmosphere and the view rather than the food.Parking is available in an adjacent paid lot that supports several of the businesses on the pier.",2 star rating,Anthony N.

Pros: -Anything on the menu is pretty much delicious-The view to the harbor and SB is gorgeous-The staff is friendlyCons: -The wait. I srsly can't tell u how many times we had to sit outside and wait a half hour to even an hour and half to get in! It's always so busy and sometimes I really get grouchy having to put up with the wait.-The tables are tiny and are close together. If you're claustrophobic, this ain't your place. With a group of 4 ppl and each of u ordering a plate, the small table makes it look as if you've ordered a ton even though u haven't. -LOUD. Can anyone say noise control? Idk wat it is about this place (the way it was built?) but if you're a fan of peace and quiet DO NOT COME HERE. It can be deafening at times. Oh and the staff here is normally really friendly, but don't expect to get ur waiter/waitress's attention easily. Since it's always packed, everyone is super busy, zooming by with plates, receipts, bread baskets, etc. It can be insane and pretty overwhelming sometimes. I'd say it's not even worth it at times, but I'm in the minority here because most ppl believe it is because the seafood is pretty amazing.",3 star rating,Imani A.

To begin with this was an great gesture- their stars went up in my book right away. When you take the time to make sure your clients are all satisfied it shows you care even tho there is always a line out the door and they could have just brushed me aside.Soo needless to say i was impressed.unfortunately I wasn't living in the SB area anymore and it took me a little bit of time to get over there. But i am happy i finally made it!I ordered their seafood platter and their clam chowder (which was something i was disappointed in last time) an entree and some wine.I got outdoor seating and the food was great. a lot better than my last experience.

9/22/2011,"MI, MI","For a seafood restaurant in a very touristy area, Brophy Bros. is decent, but not particularly the best place to go if you want great seafood. Their hot seafood appetizer plate (mussels, shell-on shrimp, oysters Rockefeller, baked clams) is tasty, though the shrimp and mussels are by far the best items on the plate. The chowder is consistent and good. When I stick to the soup and salad, I'm happy. The time before, I got the fish and chips and was really disappointed in that meal. Atmosphere-wise: Inside it's really loud, seating is very tight, and the service is touch and go. Outside it's quieter and can get cold, and you may get someone's butt in your face if you're by the outside bar. Not my idea of a good time.

2/16/2008,"Santa Barbara, CA","I feel a little bad giving Brophy's 2 stars, but I do think that anything higher would be deceiving.This is a very popular place, local love it, tourists are drawn to it. Views, yes, they have them! Charm and rustic looking, yes! Long waits for a table, yes!But when visitors ask me where to go for good seafood, I do not suggest Brophy's. Once I did have to take visitors, because they were so insistent. And afterwards, much disappointment. The half avocado in one of the salads was acturally hard and inedible without a steak knive. The fresh fish of the day is always poorly done. Always. I'm really scratching my head over this one. It's always dry, even salmon. It's so hard to mess up salmon.  Didn't you see that Top Chef episode where the contestants have to make airline food? One guy specifically choose salmon because it's near impossible to dry out.  And yet, Brophy's can do it. A few core items, though, are good. Very good chowder, and acceptable fish and chips.  I do occasionally come here for lunch with a few friends for the above items. If this place just focused on bar food - like the fish and chips, chowder, oysters -  they'd get a better rating from me.  The atmosphere is great for that. But it claims to be more and those who come here expecting finer food may be disappointed.",2 star rating,Lemonjelly L.

We had to wait for a while in the bar below, but it was alright waiting there, because we were able to order ourselves some yummy appetizers and drinks. The drinks weren't so good because they ran out of a lot of things, so it ended up being just a mishmosh of things. Meh. But we got the Garlic Baked Clams, which were really good. We got tons of other stuff, way too much actually... tons and tons of food.  It was a pretty good place - the food was alright, and I liked the view (we sat out on the patio overlooking the marina).

1/4/2010,"San Jose, CA","What happens when you go off of a restaurant suggestion from a friend on facebook instead of doing a lot of research on Yelp?  Not really much if your friend has good taste in food.  My special lady friend and I tried out Brophy Brothers after arriving in SB for a weekend getaway.  We were hungry and it was late and we didn't expect many places to be open since it was New Years day.  We called Brophy Brothers (BB) and they sounded BUSY.  We put BB into the GPS and we were off.  It was easy to find with not so great parking but somehow we had great luck and found a spot that someone was pulling out of while we drove up. Hooray!BB is a seafood restaurant and clam bar.  I would suggest they emphasize the clam bar.  With a three course meal, appetizer, soup (or salad) and entree; we were sufficiently stuffed but not really satisfied. Baked Garlic Clams (4*): The highlight of the meal which was still not amazing.  These clams (I think they were cherry stone clams) ha da bunch of finely chopped garlic and a small piece of bacon.  All that topped with a bit of butter that melted through and drew all the flavors together.  What does that mean other than a heart attack?  Yumminess.  The only problem is that the small sliver of bacon (which was 1/3 the size of the clam) overpowered all the other flavors.  It was good but it was better with eating the clam separately.Clam Chowder (4.5*):  Nothing really jaw dropping here.  If you go to any pier side restaurant, they had better have great clam chowder.  BB's didn't disappoint with their version of this standard seafood soup.  Creamy and LOTS of clams, the clam chowder followed the garlic clams and set us up with high expectations for the entree since it was so tasty!My Entree: Mahi mahi with saffron/crab sauce (1*).  Yeah....  If you ever want to try to eat something the is epitome of underwhelming, try this dish.  Why?  The saffron crab sauce tasted like over-buttery alfredo sauce, the fries were terrible, and the only reason I finished it is because I was that hungry.  Even scraping the sauce off the fish, the fish seemed limp and not well cooked.  The closest thing to salvage it was douse it in lemon and sprinkle some salt on it.  Then it was still a soggy limp mass on the plate.  Seafood linguini - You can read Cherie T's review for this.  She basically got it down to a T.  One redeeming factor on it was that the linguini did have a nice taste, none of which had anything to do with seafood.  Overall, I'd say come here for appetizers.  Their beer selection seemed to be pretty good and do NOT come here with a large group unless you want to be waiting for forever and a day.  If I ever do go back to SB, I'll probably give BB a try and get the cioppino (Which everyone around us ordered and looked great) or the hot appetizer plate.  But definitely will avoid the fishes.",3 star rating,Eric L.

Everything I ate was fresh. I had their sampler which came with ceviche, scallops, oysters and shrimp.Shrimp was not peeled (no biggie).  Fresh in taste, and went great with their cocktail sauce...Oyster and scallops... I'm no expert. so... um... yeah...  alls i know it was fresh.The ceviche was bland.  Of course the ingredients were fresh but being latino... I like my ceviche more flavorful.  and it was...  dry kinda.  like... it lacked that pulpy tomato water found at latino marisco spots...  i dunno.  just wasn't my cup of tea...I also had fried calamari: Nothing spectacular but that batter was great.  Light. crispy.   doesn't take away from the taste of calamari...Now their clam chowder...  Off the hook!  Thick and creamy, with chunks of clam and potato...  Probably among their strongest dishes....  I was really impressed.The staff was extremely friendly, and of course busy, but they managed to service us in a 5 star manner.  The host was extremely nice, and even served us water...  don't see many host taking on that kind of role.the view was darn sexy.  and it really added to my SB experience....  Will definitely return to try other dishes...",4 star rating,Samuel C.

4/27/2009,"Anaheim, CA","Well, after reading all those great reviews, this seemed like the place to eat.It wasn't.On the plus side, the service was great. It's a small place, so waiting for a table is understandable. However, we arrived early, so we were seated right away.On the downside, while the clam chowder was indeed quite delicious, it also included an ingredient that I wasn't expecting: sand. For such a popular place, you'd think they'd be better about cleaning up their clams. Speaking of cleaning, we ordered the hot combination platter. It contained Beer Boiled Shrimp, Garlic Baked Clams, Oysters Rockefeller, Steamed Mussels w/Broth and Steamed Clams w/Broth. For the most part, everything was just a bit overcooked. And after chowing down for a while, I quickly lost my appetite when I realised the shrimp hadn't been deveined. Bleh.Not sure how this place became so popular. Maybe I'm just a seafood snob.",2 star rating,Smivey ..

9/26/2010,"San Francisco, CA","A classic surf and turf lunch spot right on the harbor is hard to beat. What makes Brophy Brothers a great choice is the laid back atmosphere, unpretentious style of the patrons and the inevitable feeling of relaxation that comes with a seat outside on a sunny Santa Barbara day. Since it's off the main strip it manages to evade the honeymooners, meat heads  and teen goth contingent of State Street. The menu is short and sweet loaded heavy with fresh shellfish options. The dungeness crab was good, as is the seafood linguini but don't expect anything genius coming from the kitchen. Same with the straightforward and simple approach to cocktails. A bloody Mary, oyster shooter and simple shot of tequila is about all you need from bartender.Roll through for lunch and watch the boats rock in the harbor. It's hard not to have a good time here.",4 star rating,Jane K.

6/2/2011,"Chicago, IL","We had lunch here while visiting Santa Barbara because everyone raved about the fish. And it was definitely worth stopping in. Very fast-paced and busy restaurant with nice outdoor seating overlooking the wharf. I loved the clam chowder and my swordfish as well - the mango relish that accompanies it is so flavorful. The only complaint would be my friend's tilapia, which he felt was slightly overspiced and over-blackened (if that is even possible). (He's also a food snob. I tried it and it tasted good and spicy.) Definitely a fun, lively, very coastal place to stop in for some fish. I highly recommend it.",4 star rating,Lauren B.

The Berenstain bears?"" ha ha...Anyway, besides the slight confusion of its name, the food here is awesome.  I chose the salmon from the ""Fish of the Day"" menu and it was cooked soo perfectly.  It was moist, flaky, and drizzed in bell pepper cream sauce, OMG.  I tried the boyfriend's fish and chips which was also tasty. You can suggest outdoor seating and it's an ocean-front view of the harbor.  You can also complement your seating with a bowl of clam chowder to share and sparks can fly. I took off one star because I had a slight allergic reaction to the oyster, I think.  BUT, the sauce was yummy, so it overruled some of my discomfort.  Also, an hour wait is a little ridiculous.  We almost had a brawl with another couple until the hosts buzzed us in a little earlier than the other.  If you're in Santa Barbara, you need to experience this.",4 star rating,Jessica Y.

I drove up State st. and back down. Nothing really stood out! No restaurants with a line and yummy smells pouring out of them. Felt too touristy..... Then the food god's guided me to the Marina. Right on the water. Amazing day outside!! The boats, water, birds (you get it). There were several places to choose from. I was now at the point were my bestest friend Maya papaya was getting bitchy and irritated with my ""search for the perfect lunch""!! And then I saw it!! Outdoor 2ed story patio!! A crowd!! THE SMELL OF FOOD HEAVEN !! Right on the water overlooking the SB hills and marina. Maya sees the crowd. She's not happy (did I mention). She has no choice - I have decided. We walk up the stairs and see indoor/bar/outside deck seating. I want the OUTSIDE!! I'm at the beach!! Theres a wait. We wait. (The food god's smile on us again) Some guy gives us his seat # and leaves! Then it gets CALLED!! SCORE!!! We are guided to the perfect table for 2, right on the rail!

7/29/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","My first review, only because I had the BEST fried scallops EVER. And clams on the half shell were SO GOOD!!!! Paired with a few Widmer Hefs, I can't wait to go back! The fried clams were way better than the calamari, but both good. The Garlic clams were ok. I was expecting so much more from the reviews, but that's just me. If you asked my brother, he'd be way more excited about them. He ordered another plate just for himself. He also had seconds of the fried clams. Clam chowder...lets just say 2 cups for 5 people = 2 little. Add a bowl, 2 much. Sheesh, that was a lot of chowder, but HELL yes, I'll have more! Thanks.By the time we all got done eating our ""appetizers"", we hardly had room for the meal. We shared seafood pasta and the seabass. All tasty and thats about all we could stomach. Took home most the pasta.The best part about this experience besides the scallops and everything else was the BILL! We ate so much for 5, I was shocked it all came out to just over $100!

5/27/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","Noted for having the best clam chowder in Santa Barbara, I had to check this place out on a day trip to SB. For me, the chowder was just OK. It's overpriced (we got a tiny, tea-cup sized serving to share for $5) and I really think I've had better, inland even! It did have a nice consistency to it (not too runny, not too thick) and a good amount of clams. Also had a plate of fish and chips which was pretty good.What this place is awesome for is the view of the harbor if you land a seat outside. What's also beautiful is having the view of the harbor on one side and having a view of people's crotches and butts on the other. The bar extends outside, leaving a ton of people hanging around it and leaving very little room for those dining. But turn your head and all's well.Service was also very mediocre. It's clear that the troupe of teens working the place have no desire to keep you coming back since there will be 300 other tourists waiting to fill your seat when you leave.",3 star rating,Stella K.

7/8/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","I had to wait a few weeks to write a review for this place, because I probably would have maxed out the number of characters allowed in reviews. So I'll just briefly express my sheer disgust and disappointment towards this place...After Yelping a ""good"" seafood place to get a drink at in SB, this place was the hype. So of course, we hit it up and... WOW. Asides from the service, EVERYTHING about this placed sucked. And ""sucked"" is me being nice. Actually, I believe I already mentioned it was disgusting, so let's leave it at that. The ""best bloody mary's in SB"" were the worst either one of us has ever had, the clam chowder was about as good as the canned Campbell's stuff, and the cold combination platter... damn. The ""ceviche"" was unlike anything I have ever seen or tasted. I can't imagine where they got their ""ceviche"" recipe, but I'm still unsure of what the hell it actually was. Asides from that, it tasted like nothing. I mean, no kind of flavor whatsoever. No, I'm lying. It was nasty. I didn't try the clams, but apparently they were ""edible,"" as was the shrimp, since it was just cold shrimp. The only other possible way to screw up ""peel and eat"" shrimp is for it to still have been frozen or spoiled. I'll stop now...I do have to acknowledge that the servers at this place were very attentive and friendly, with a constant smile on their face. Although I'm going to attribute that to an intense fear of the manager, as he appeared to be quite the a-hole, based on my observed interactions with employees.I could go on and on, but I think I've gotten my point across. I am dumbfounded how this place has such good reviews, considering there's plenty of good eats in SB.",1 star rating,Gino E.

Calamari plate was the freshest and crispy on the outside-perfect choice.  Raw oysters were fabulous. The Christmas ale hit the spot. The beer boiled shrimp were awesome! Julian made us feel so welcomed that we just had to stay a bit longer than we needed. We were tempted to try everything he offered but obviously couldn't. Everything we ordered was a home run!

5/18/2009,"Irvine, CA","The cold combination was really really fresh and awesomely delicious. Especially the oysters and clams on the half shell. They were sweet, mild, and had wonderful texture. You're in for a treat if you've never had clams on a half shell! Mmmmmm.... the shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned, cerviche fresh! and the snow crab meat a bit fishy.I was a bit disappointed in the fish (I got the seabass) it was much to chewy and flaky. The texture was dry and not all what I expected with the hefty $25 price tag. But, with the dish includes the CLAM CHOWDER. Ha... ok... ok ..... you got me. I'd come back in a heartbeat. Full of fresh, chewy clams in each bite, hearty chunks of potato and creamy soup..... topped with a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I was in chowder-heaven.The bf opted of the seared Ahi. It was tender, mild, and enjoyed, but very forgettable. The shining stars here are the clams, oysters, and chowder.

3/24/2010,"Glendale, AZ","Thanks to the stellar Yelp reviews, I've been eying Brophy forever. I hoped that by going at 3 in the afternoon we'd manage to avoid the crowds, however no such luck. It might as well have been smack dab during lunch or dinner time.   Every table was filled and every chair taken, but luckily a party ahead of us didn't seem to make it back in time and we became the happy recipients of the empty table.Having done my HW, I knew what to order. Two bowls of clam chowder and the hot combination platter please! We were seated by the awkward table beside the stairs where everyone leaves. So while we waited the long long time for our food, we get to people watch as they strut toward the stairs with their tummies full of Brophy goodness.I didn't enjoy the bread, but I've never developed an appreciation for sour dough anyways. Dad finished his and some more but I'm pretty sure it's due to hunger. 15 minutes must have passed before the hot combo plate came. 2 garlic butter bake clams, 2 oyster Rockefellers, and the little dish full of mussels and shrimps that we each had plenty of. The lackluster bread became a star in its own right when dipped in the clam chowder. It was a match made in heaven. We scarfed down the food and ordered some more. Ciopinno and a hot plate with only the garlic butter clams and oyster Rockefellers.The highlight of the meal was definitely the CIopinno. Chunks of fish, shrimps, mussels, and tomato covered in melted parmesan and sitting in a bowl of tomato goodness. Being a tomato hater myself, I was astounded by how delicious it was. I can honestly say that the meal wouldnt' have been half as good without the Ciopino. It completed the meal.Bill was $20 p/p.

5/12/2010,"San Diego, CA","So based off of the reviews, my husband and I decided to try out Brophy Brothers for dinner.  We weren't disappointed.  The place was indeed busy when we arrived but we were more than happy to sit inside, so we were seated right away.  Instead of ordering a full meal, we decided to split a variety of seafood appetizers and most of it was quite good. The first round we had the hot appetizer sampler that contained garlic baked clams that were delicious.  The oysters Rockafeller was quite good and the spice combination in them was pretty interesting.  I would probably avoid it if you aren't a tad adventurous but I really enjoyed them.  The steamed mussels were just so-so but the clams were large and plump.  To be honest, I've had better steamers but in general I prefer the butter wine version over the salt water brine variety.  The shrimp were also very tasty and fresh but a tad small.The next round we split a bowl of clam chowder that was absolutely fantastic.  I wouldn't miss it!  I haven't had chowda this good since I last visited Boston.  We also had an order of the chilled Dungeoness crab with drawn butter that was absolutely yummo.Let me also comment that even though the place was busy, the service was excellent!  We had barely finished our food before the bus staff came through and cleared the mess.  The food also came out quickly!I highly recommend this restaurant!  The only reason I didn't give them five stars was due to selection but this might be because of the freshness of their selections.",4 star rating,Angela F.

Hostess wanted to split up the party...but that doesn't work when you're dealing with a family unit on Mother's day.Clam chowder, oysters, steamed clams, fish n chips were all good.  Beer boiled shrimp....not tasty at all and too messy.Brophy Bros. may want to consider reservations for bigger parties so to avoid making fish lovers wait ""two"" long.",3 star rating,happy o.

First off, it was a warm evening, no cool wind, and the restaurant was uncomfortably warm. No A/C that I could feel blowing to make it feel better. I don't know how people could eat with the lighting at night...just a little too dark for me to enjoy my dinner.On to the food. In a word, bland. The only good thing about the meal was the appetizer, which consisted of the hot combination platter. The beer boiled shrimp, garlic clams, Oysters Rockefeller were all delicious. I decided to try the clam chowder just to compare to ones I've had before, and it was the first of many disappointments. Just way too bland, and I could barely taste the clam broth or whatever clam flavor needed to be in there. I decided on the blackened cajun tilapia for an entree, and again, surprisingly bland. Besides the appetizer, the other upside to the experience is the service. Prompt and friendly. Otherwise, this was a complete letdown.",2 star rating,Chris F.

5/22/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","I HATE Brophy Bros! I don't want to spend money at this place! However, their clam chowder makes me come back. Shit!!Everything sucks at Brophy Bros except for the romantic outside seating and the clam chowder. First, you have to talk to young girls who have no manners at the front. Don't worry if they don't recognize you. That happens often. Next, you have to wait to be seated for around half an hour. Finally you can get your food, but it's usually over seasoned or has no taste. Especially, do not have an oyster shooter! It's worse than garbage.This would be a one star place if there was no clam chowder. Somehow, this soup is cooked perfectly and includes a bunch of clam. For some reason I regret to admit, this is the best clam chowder ever. So, whenever I want to have clam chowder, I come back here and I'm pissed of by their service every time.There you go.",2 star rating,Shirly T.

Not such a big deal really, but not how I prefer mine. Just FYI. Begged for bread and they bring it fresh out of the fridge.

Both were such hugeee portions and we couldn't even finish it. Must say that the crab cakes were perfect.

After today, methinks my friends won't let me choose again for awhile.I mean, I really wanted to like this place. Everyone else seems to really love it. I honestly thought the food was blah, basically every entree we ordered was forgettable.The oysters and clams on the half shell were good but that doesn't really require any effort. We ordered the ciopinno, the seafood pasta, the seafood skewer and the fish and chips. None of which really appealed to our palates.I'm not ready to completely give up on Brophy Brothers but I think I'm just going to stick with appetizers next time.

10/10/2011,"Fountain Valley, CA","Good and fresh seafood.  The wait is a little ridiculous for the overall experience here, in my opinion (I waited 1.5 hrs and it only took me about 20 minutes to eat).  However, if you do eat at the marina, this is the place to go.  That is, if you don't want to pay even more to eat at the swanky Waterfront restaurant next door (Waterfront has a very Miami Beach vibe at night).  I tried the cold sampler platter (the peel and eat beer shrimp were the best and the mixed ceviche-ish salad was disgusting - $15), hot sampler platter (traditional entree of wine-steamed mussels, clams, and shrimp and includes dressed up baked clams and mussels- everything on this platter was tasty- $15), and salmon salad (a-ok, $13).  I loved their cocktail sauce and hated their sourdough bread (it was cold and the crust was too hard).  I was pretty miffed about the seating arrangements they threw me into.  They seated me upstairs on the balcony which had an amazing view overlooking the marina (yay!) to my right.  However, the downside was that to my left, I had a full view of 4 other patrons' asses and crotch (covered up, of course) and was constantly brushed up against by staff because those patrons were eating their dinner on the bar counter while standing up and the staff had to walk up and down the same galley in order to tend to seated patrons.  It was pretty claustraphobic, to say the least (and disgusting too). I would come back if I were in the area and wanted fresh seafood, but I would specifically ask NOT to sit anywhere near the bar counter (inside or outside), just to ensure I'm not subjected to looking at other people's private areas while I am sitting and eating my meal.Other important info: long waits, quick service, fresh seafood, cramped seating, no dessert (!!!), limited free 90 minute parking in the front, parking is very difficult, must walk up a steep flight of stairs to reach front-desk.",3 star rating,T C.

Gentleman waiting to be seated wearing four-color corduroys- good sign (preppies know good seafood).It was cold out but we sat on the wraparound deck anyway. Recommend inside on cold nights (the heaters are wimpy), but if you show up at prime time you will W-A-I-T for an inside table.We had GREAT clam chowder, good fresh oysters (not as good as Hungry Cat or Sgt. Recruiter and if I remember correctly they only had one variety), and a big old plate of grilled thresher shark. A perfectly awful glass of chardonnay for el hombre and a truly, truly awful martini for me. So, you do not come here for the mixology or sommelier knowledge.We had a great time anyway.

So we asked a friend who was born and raised in SB for suggestions, and his first response was, ""Brophy Brothers!"" We ordered the Garlic Baked Clams as an appetizer.... and it was HEAVENLY. I mean think about it: fresh clams in a half shell baked in a buttery, garlic concoction. And topped of with some lemon juice and a piece of BACON. Yeah, you read that right: butter, garlic, and bacon. Every girls nightmare... Goodbye to any diet, right?The entrees were acceptable, but not too memorable.  I ordered the Hawaiian ahi tuna (medium rare) which was breaded w/cashews and covered in tarragon & a creamy, slighty sweet mustard. My beau ordered the sea bass, which was covered in a salsa, chipotle sauce.  My fish was a little too dry and I did not enjoy it as much as how my bf enjoyed his fish. We both agreed that I should have just ordered the Hot Combination Platter, which includes the garlic baked clams, beer boiled shrimp, oysters Rockefeller, and steamed mussels and clams in broth.  MMM... much better than a dry fish, rice, and coleslaw!

6/20/2008,"Santa Barbara, CA","Be prepared to wait. Unless it's raining you can wait anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. But they give you these little buzzers so you can cruise around the harbor worry free that you won't lose your place in line.Personally I never order off the fish menu. I have always been disappointed by the meal and the bill just drives the point home. But I keep going back. Ironically they have a pretty good burger, their garlic baked clams are delicious and everyone raves about the chowder and the chowder loaf and years ago I enjoyed it myself but have since become lactose intolerant.Oh, and they have a full bar with nice views of the harbor so getting smashed always helps.Parking is a nightmare at the harbor, I recommend turning right just after you enter and avoiding the disaster zone that is the rest of the area. Or you can pay to walk even further .. go figure.",4 star rating,Thomas P.
11/6/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","I've gone here a couple times and I just have to say, it never ceases to amaze me how delicious their food is! I've only tried a few things on their menu, but I have no doubt in my mind that their entire menu is equally as outstanding as the items I've previously had.If you haven't already tried their clam chowder, I highly recommend that you go out and try it right now! I'm serious. I was always curious as to why Brophy's wins best Clam Chowder ever year, and, after finally taking my first scrumptious bite, I saw that no other restaurant's clam chowder compared. And let me just add that I come from San Francisco, where, arguably, THE Best clam chowder is made, and yet, Brophy's takes the trophy for me. Another favorite of mine is the garlic baked clams. Now, I'm not a big clam fan, but these tasty delights are a must have. They are topped with bread crumbs, bacon bits, and baked in some buttery garlic goodness. Top it off with some fresh squeezed lemon and voila! You have the best damn seafood appetizer in Santa Barbara.I have to mention the Bloody Mary for any who are fans of this hangover cure. I'm not a connoisseur or anything, and sometimes I flat out don't like them (too much pepper), but this Bloody Mary rivals that of Tupelo Junction. It's no wonder that these two duke it out every year for best Bloody Mary, and I can see why Brophy's has taken the prize the last two + years. So, if you're bold and want to try one for the first time or if you're familiar with this drink, I think you'll lust after this one. There are a few other mentionables like the fries, fish and chips, and burger, but I don't think I need to go any further to convince anyone to try this wonderful seafood palace. If you're not already sold, as you should be, you would be depriving your palate of one delicious adventure.",4 star rating,Stephanie C.

4/25/2010,"La Puente, CA","Ok...after reading the great reviews on this place my wife and I decided to give it a try.  Boy were we disappointed.  The wife had the Cioppino which was overflowing with tomato stew and tons of parmesan cheese. This dish was ok at best. Not too much going on but for the average seafood eater who just wants everything in their soup, this might be a decent choice. I didn't like it too much and I really can't speak for my wife. The one thing I thought was great was the service. The waiters were there whenever I needed something and even when I didn't need anything. Service with a smile...somewhat of a smile. They were busy so not too many smiles.Now to my dish...I had Tilapia which I thought was the hardest thing to screw up. They certainly screwed it up bad! The spices used on the fish were horrible. There was a slight but noticeable taste of gasoline or some kind of flamable liquid on the fish. I thought it was all in my head but the wife tasted the same thing. I was pretty disappointed. The rice pilaf that it can with was undercooked and the coleslaw was bland. Before my dish came though, I opted to have a cup of clam chowder and the baked clams. It was very thin and had no thickness to it. The taste was ok but tasted like canned soup to me. I think Splash Cafe in San Luis Obispo has a better one and I thought that one was ok. I guess nothing really beats the clam chowder at Big Al's in the Orleans in Vegas. Thats another story though. As for the baked clams, it seems to be an interesting idea but the bacon really kill the entire dish because it was completely charred. I think the clams alone w/o the bacon could hqave earned 3 stars alone but the bacon bumped it down one star to match the other dishes.Overall, probably not the best place for seafood but I think people should give it a try if they are in the area because my one order shouldn't be the deciding factor for all of Brophy Bros. dishes. How do you CUSS up talapia though?!?! I would maybe steer clear of the ones i mentioned above though. Oh yeah...overpriced too.",2 star rating,Michael K.

I, having lived in New England for the last 4 years, took this with a grain of salt, but wanted to try this place out anyway. There's a small bar area downstairs and then the restaurant is upstairs.  It's one of those cute places were the tables are right next to each other and people squeeze past you as they walk by.  It's more of a hangout place, not so much a first day, quiet talking place. We ordered peel and eat shrimp which was very sweet and delicious.  We also ordered their assorted hot seafood appetizer which gave us a good feel for all of the other seafood they had - their clams, mussels, and oysters were ok.  The next dish we had was their famous clam chowder.  I prefer the thicker type of clam chowder than brothy and this place had a hearty thick soup - it had more celery flavor then I am used to, but overall it was a decent clam chowder.  The pricing is decent and the best part of the place was the view.  It overlooks the harbor and the boats and it was beautiful.  It really adds to the experience of dinner.  I'd definitely come back here again.",4 star rating,Theresa V.

I didn't think it could get any better, until... I tried the chowder. The chowder is absolutely delicious. In fact, as a former New Englander, I have to say this is some of the best chowder I've ever had on EITHER coast. Get it.

I always order the fried shrimp, clam chowder and all the margaritas I can handle - it's just so good I wouldn't dare stray. BUT other dining companions through the years have given high marks to all their oyster dishes, fish sandwiches and pretty much everything they serve. What really seals the deal are the great bartenders and atmosphere, it's a place where everyone is there to relax and have fun.

We came after the rain had settled and cleared a bit, and we saw a DOUBLE RAINBOW!!! OMG DOUBLE RAINBOW. LOL. I came here with my better half after my friend suggested coming here. The seafood is really fresh and all prepared perfectly.First we ordered a big bowl of calm chowder which was made just how I like it. The Chowder had a good amount of clams and veggies and wasn't to thick. I had oysters on the half shell and my boyfriend had beer boiled shrimp. I love oysters and these were fresh and sweet. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp they were cooked well but it was just plain for me. We then decided we were still hungry so we proceeded to order some fish and chips. And it was perfectly fried, not greasy and the batter was crispy and light.  The fish was tender and flaky, and really hit the spot. Now My boyfriend isn't one for coleslaw but really liked theirs so i guess there is something too it. I like it too, it was creamy and still had the crunchy bite that cabbage should have.

We walked in and there was a wait, but a short one, that is fine we walked down to the first level and went in the gift shop and just watched the water and boats, very enjoyable to be honest. After about 10 minutes we got our table and started on the menu. I wanted to order everything. We ended up deciding on the garlic baked clams for an appetizer and then I had the swordfish and Harry had a bowl of clam chowder. The garlic baked clams might be one of my favorite menu items EVER. Just amazing. I don't think I can ever order clams from anywhere else because they just won't be as good. The swordfish was exactly how I liked it, grilled and I added a little lemon juice but it did come with a delicious guacamole! Service was good, did not feel rushed even though it was slammed, she was friendly and nice. Always kept refilling our water and Harry's soda so that was a plus since that is one of my pet peeves.

All sorts of fresh fish. I'm usually here for a margarita, maybe some steamed clams or mussels, even the fish and chips. Note the the Calif mussels aren't available now - a moritorium - so it's the New Zealand green ones. I'd skip 'em until black is back. Entrees look good but are a little more expensive and seem wrote with the steamed veggies on the side.It's busy all the time and busier yet at meal times. If you can get there a little before or after, you might actually score a table on the narrow outdoor balcony. Seats at the bar are fine, so are the tables.

If you timed it right you could see the sun set over the Channel Islands while enjoying the finest in fresh grilled seafood. The menu is based on catch of the day, so there is always something to your liking. The sourdough bread is worth the visit alone. The seafood is served simply, grilled or blackened, with great coleslaw (""I remember when coleslaw used to anchor a meal"", Thirty Helens Agree, KITH) or steamed veggies on the side.

Next i just started ordering a starter of the Fried Scallops and a Bowl of Chowder with a Salad...The Chowder and Scallops came out within in ten minutes hot and fresh! Also they slipped bread and butter onto my table at some point rather quickly as well, within 3 minutes of me sitting down.The Scallops were delectable! Perfectly cooked and breaded! Probably my favorite thing! Clam Chowder was great, a very good amount of clams and potatoes nothing was overwhelming the dish... I feel like they put in an extra ingredient to make it taste so good, but whatever it was, it was just right!   Yasmin was really wonderful continuing to ask how the meal was, how i was doing etc, she also thought to put in my main dish of fried fish a little later so i could finish the food in front of me, she did it effortlessly!Everything tasted fantastic, once i got the fish i couldnt even eat anymore!  The Fish was very nicely breaded, but possibly too much breading, but certainly not oil filled!! It tasted good! ***I would have given 5 stars, but the menu could have been a little more malleable, and alas at the end of my meal even after i told Yasmin expressly not to clear my table,(and gave a generous tip) my table was cleared my to-go meal and sunglasses moved out of the way and half of my beer disposed of because i went to the restroom!!

4/9/2013,"Anaheim, CA","During a recent road trip, we decided to stop here for a seafood lunch.  Arriving early ~11:30am, we encountered no line.  However when we left an hour later, it was much more crowded.  So getting there early would be a wise idea, especially if you want a table outside on a nice day. Between the two of us, we ordered the dungenous crab, half dozen oysters, clam chowder, and salmon avocado salad.  The crab and oysters were both very fresh and tasted great with the condiments provided.  The clam chowder was excellent, they are pretty generous with the clam meat.  Salmon avocado salad was also well dressed, the seared salmon seasoned and cooked perfectly. Overall, the food was average to above average, no complaints there.The service on the other hand, was a completely different story.  Our server was rude and inattentive.  He looked very young, but that is no excuse.  After we finished the appetizers (crab and oysters), the clam chowder came out.  After 20 min as we finished the soup, we assumed the salad had been forgotten since the salad and soup were ordered as ENTREES for us two.  Finally, after waiting forever for the server to come around, I asked him what happened to the salad.  He said its still coming, there wasnt enough room on the table to fit both plates.  We just looked at him dumbfounded, because the table was CLEARLY large enough for two plates.  What an idiot.  He didn't even bother asking us if we wanted both entrees coming out at the same time (why on earth wouldn't we).  He also never apologized for forgetting twice to bring more bread out.  If he owned up to his honest mistakes and acted mature & gracious about it, we wouldn't have been so annoyed by him.",3 star rating,Mina W.

We sat on the patio which was nice but the service was seriously lacking. Our waitress took our order and never came back until after we were done eating. We both got some clam chowder which was OK.

We ordered 1/2 doz. oysters on half shell, garlic baked clams, cup of clam chowder, cioppino, and local swordfish to share.The clam chowder was probably one of the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot!). It was just the right amount of cream and balance of clams and potatoes. YUM! The cioppino was also very tasty and had a good variety of seafood. I'm not a huge swordfish eater, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I enjoyed the texture and taste of the swordfish entree.One tip: come early if you want a table by the window so you can view the sunset whilst you eat.-L.",4 star rating,Leeann C.

The Garlic Baked Clams speak for themselves. I'm addicted to them, I could easily polish off a whole plate. The Cioppino is also a favorite. You get a nice heaping bowlful with ample amounts of seafood. If the broth for that came in a bottle, I would chug that shit on the regular. Luckily they provide plenty of fresh bread, to sop up all of it. Speaking of broth, the Steamed Mussels come with a nice cup of Garlic, Lemon broth. They use Local Black Mussels which are freaking huge, and taste incredible when dipped in it, as does the bread. I usually order a Bloody Mary as they make an excellent one.",5 star rating,Marc S.

I did get the fries - good - but by the time it got to us, it was luke warm. Fries are much better when crispy and piping hot.

We needed a place to eat so I used my handy-dandy Yelp! and found Brophy Bros. - and am soooo happy that I did!First, the bread is to die for! I could have filled up on that but had enough willpower to hold our for the main course. We started with calamari. A lot of restaurants give you about 8 pieces for the same price but here, we received an entire plate full!! For the main course, my husband had the fish and chips and I had the avocado and shrimp salad. He said the fish and chips was the best he ever had. He's not a big fan of coleslaw so I finished that for him and it was wonderful. My salad was SOOOO good. The avocado was perfect and the dressing (not sure what it was) was amazing.The next BEST part was when we got the bill. I assumed it was going to be pricey but soooo not!

The remainder of its menu is mediocre at best, and the wait is nearly always insane.

2/23/2014,"Carpinteria, CA",Was very disappointed in their ciopinno.  It had absolutely no flavor at all.  Seemed like they used just plain water in the soup instead of fish stock or chicken stock.  It didn't have any seafood flavor.  It seemed like the shellfish was precooked and they just added it to the pot.  So it lacked that nice flavor that seafood can only bring.   I won't let that upset me though.  Its still top notch for fried calamari and calm chowder.,2 star rating,Lajaune W.

It's a turn and burn restaurant so plan to be rushed. We were rushed before we sat down. The waiter wanted our order before we had menus. We wanted to sit and talk with a cocktail first. The water came back 3 times to get our order. We ordered oysters Rockefeller before we could finish the salad came and before I could eat one bite our dinner came, there was no place to put the plates because no one cleared the previous course. So I kept eating and made the waiter stand there with my plate until I was finished.  The swordfish was as thin as cardboard and tasted as such.

8/29/2009,"Corona, CA","First off it's called Brophy's Brothers.  If that doesn't shout a damn good time then I don't know what does.  Let's get to the skinny of this.  This is a seafood restaurant on the harbor so dammit make sure you eat seafood.  This is what we had.Clam Chowder - Nice chunks of clam but watery.  I don't think I need to say more.  Splash Cafe (see my reviews) hands down.  Funny thing is, I ran into a local woman outside that was trying to school us on the food and we were told that the Clam Chowder was the best she had ever had.  Let's put it this way I can think of 5 places without even blinking an eye better than this place.Oysters On The Half Shell - Fresh, Cold and Tasty.  Horseradish was not very good but other than that you rarely can mess this up with restaurants on the shore.Grilled Salmon Salad - Portions were hearty.  I'm talking nice bright colored vegetables, cherry tomatoes, olives etc...  I swear it looked like grandma just picked it out of the garden.Calamari - Ok this is where the money was.  Damn thing was so good and you know what, it was the best I've ever had.  Calamari was tender and juicy and the batter was incredible.  It was not that crappy batter they use on onion rings nor was it the thick coating that others use.  This was perfectly coated yet thin and flaky.  It crumbled in your mouth and was perfectly seasoned.  I would go back for this alone.  They also had in the same section of fried goodies, clams, scallops, shrimps and fish.  I'm just hoping they use the same batter and this is for sure a repeat stop on my next road trip.This place really deserves a 5 but it was hard for me to decide because if the local was telling me the clam chowder was the best she had ever had and claimed to have eaten the whole menu then damn it should be pretty good.  The rest of the meal was a 5 but I then think to myself what others things on the menu could be like the clam chowder.  Looking around I saw some things that looked ok.  I guess I didn't really have a complete meal but their fish selection really looked good.Maybe on my next trip I'll have to try other things on the menu and I can revise my review to a 5.",4 star rating,Monty V.

1/26/2011,"Philadelphia, PA","Brophy! These brothers deserve a trophy! (sorry I could not resist)So this review is fresh, as, I literally just got done eating there. So the taste/service is fresh in my head. The service was very good. The joint was crowded and I arrived around 6pm in the middle of the week, during dinnertime. So, I had to wait 15minutes but with the crowds, it was expected. The waiter was very courteous and suggested some first-time recommendations. So I ended up with the Mahi Mahi platter and the yelp-acclaimed garlic baked clams to accompany the entree. The Mahi Mahi was Excellent. Fish infused with flavor and had soy savorings from inside and out, beginning to end. Make sure you get the clam chowder instead of the salad greens for the dinner dishes. Now, I have to tell you, I am going by a baseline earlier in the day, when I tried out Elephant Bar, yes, the 1.5-star Elephant Bar. Don't Ask.

It's one of the few restaurants directly on the harbor with a solid seafood menu, comes packed with Santa Barbara history and culture, and usually boasts a wait time that will make you feel like you're missing out if you don't do. If that isn't a recipe for success, I don't know what is. However, the food just isn't that that great ... especially after you factor in an hour and a half wait and a hefty premium on clam chowder. The ambiance is noisy and crowded thanks to the restaurant's popularity (good problem to have, I know). Despite falling short of the hyped up, talked out, celebrated expectations - it's still one of those ""Santa Barbara staples"" that rarely gets left out of the lineup for tourists and out of town guests.",3 star rating,Whitney K.

The bread was cold, old and when i asked the server to warm it up the server just brought another batch even colder. So, i said maybe she didnt hear me.The clam chowder was okay it missed a bit of salt but it had a lot of clams in it and it was satisfying.

5/10/2013,"Goleta, CA","Went on a Friday night after reading the great reviews and hearing that this is where the locals ate. Have to say it was the worst food experience that i have ever encountered in Santa Barbara.It has a great location, so if you are just looking to go somewhere over looking the water with all the boats then this would have you name written all over it. If you are looking for good food and nice atmosphere then might want to keep trudging along. We got there about 8pm and the hostess was nice enough to sit us on the patio, little did I know that this was a narrow set of seats where you are sitting back to back with the next table. They did bring us out bread which was a nice though but on a cold night over the water it could have been easy to heat up the bread a little, even if it was just in the microwave. Then i ordered the ceviche and it was probably the worst i have experienced. If your looking for good ceviche head up to ciliteos. The one at Brophy Brothers consisted of more tomatoes then anything else and comes with crackers instead of chips. My boyfriend ordered the Ciopino and ahve to say it tasted like tomato soup with calms thrown in. By the way the calms were chewy.

8/25/2016,"Napa, CA","Wow, what a view! Spectacular! And that's were it ends. While I loved the busy atmosphere, the appetizing bowls of chowder and oysters flying by, and the cool retro music. This is really two restaurants in one. The upstairs is a New England style casual restaurant with a large menu of seafood classics. Salads, fish, oysters,shellfish and soups. Downstairs is a narrow seafood bar with just the seafood basics and a descent wine by the glass list.We had just finished moving our son into college in Santa Barbara. We were tired but wanted to end the weekend with celebratory dinner. The 90 minute wait was daunting , but we thought we could weather the wait with a short walk and some appetizers at the seafood bar downstairs. The fried shrimp, Oysters Rockefeller, and wines were not bad. Everything seemed fresh, and served well, we starting to anticipate a lovely dinner upstairs in the main restaurant. We checked in a few times at the host stand but finally after 90 minutes I approached the cheerful hostess and asked her how much longer our wait would be. She very cheerfully informed me that it wold be another 15-20 minutes, beaming with an ear to ear smile. What? Did I miss something? I reminded her that we had checked in more than 1 and 1/2 hours earlier and I had a starving college student who was falling asleep at the bar. She cheerfully walked away and didn't say a word. Granted this pub is not fine-dining, but the indifference and arrogance of the young lady at the hosted stand was shocking to me and my family. I wanted to warn people that this place is a loud, sticky-floored tourist trap. If you expect to be treated with basic courtesy, do not go here and save your money. Take a walk along the dock, watch the sunset, and go to any one of the wonderful restaurants in the fine town of Santa Barbara.",1 star rating,Will S.
3/25/2012,"Alhambra, CA","I came here for my boyfriend's birthday once and it was really good!The prices for their daily specials are usually around 23 dollars, but it comes with a cup of clam chowder or salad and rice or fries.  They are also huge portions.  I ordered the grilled mahi mahi.  Unfortunately, it was a bit dry, but the marinated stir fried veggies that came with it was tangy and flavorful.  The dish also came with coleslaw, which was lightly dressed, just how I like it.  My boyfriend's dad ordered the ahi tuna, which was lightly breaded.  It was delicous!! The breading complemented the tuna, which was nicely cooked to medium rare.  My boyfriend ordered a seafood skewer that wasn't anything special, but was cooked very nicely.  The huge scallop was tender, and so was the salmon which was also cooked medium rare.  The best part of the meal was definitely the clam chowder.  It was creamy, and the tarragon was not overpowering at all; plus there were lots of little clams. I also loved how the potato chunks were cut in smaller pieces unlike other restaurants, and were about the same size as the clams.  That way, every spoonful of chowder you scoop up has about equal amounts of potato and clams, not just huge chunks of potatoes.  I have to say that was the best clam chowder I've had in a really long time.",4 star rating,Feyon L.
9/18/2009,"Long Beach, CA","What a great place to have lunch on a sunny, Monday afternoon!  The view was just great.  The hallibut dinner was so yummy.  The fish was flaky, flavorfull, fresh and ferfectly cooked!!  I also tried the salmon--which was almost as delicious.  Bread was awesome.  Service was so cheerful that it just made you happy.  The leering Mr. Sea Gull was a bit intimidating if you saw ""The Birds"", but I wouldn't let it put you off enjoying your meal on his balcony.  He proved harmless and quite the little ham when mugging for this headshot!",5 star rating,Tim A.
1/4/2011,"Long Beach, CA","Looks like the locals own this hip and popular spot for drinks and some awesome grub.  Must do the clam chowder, must, must, must.  Oysters Rockefeller were good, and the fish and sticks were good too.  Although a tad over fried and under seasoned but other wise an excellent piece of fish.Must return when its hot and sunny!Bonus star added: Owner sent an immediate follow up thank you email and contacted me regarding the experience.  You rarely find this level of service or class in restaurants anymore and it's nice to see people in the world still remain true to their passions.  No wonder their customers love this place!",5 star rating,Vincent S.
1/22/2008,"Huntington Beach, CA","I have tried to eat here several times in the past, but when I'm hungry and a hostess tells me the wait will be two hours, I'd rather eat anywhere else.That's why I was sooo happy the last time we went, the wait was only 30 minutes. So they sent us downstairs to the bar to snack on some bread. Eventually (in less than 30 minutes) they sat us a cute little table for two.We started out with the Oysters Rockefeller.... they were delicious, this is one of our favorites dishes, and brophy brothers did not disappoint. I ordered the seafood pasta, and the fiance ordered the swordfish.The seafood pasta was amazing! I ate as much as I could by myself them passed it across the table, where my fiance gladly finished the rest. We both agreed this was a great dish that we would order again.The swordfish was also very good. The cut of the fish was large and excellent, and it was seasoned very well. After eating both of these there was nooo room for dessert, sadly because I would have liked to try a few.We're already planning to come back for another dinner. Hopefully was can sit at the oyster bar next time... and hopefully (fingers-crossed) the wait will not be too long.",5 star rating,Danielle C.
7/29/2008,"San Diego, CA","Another reason to miss Santa Barbara. The good: The view -  I've been blessed to not have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get an outside table. The boats, the ocean, the mountains. Super awesome. OYSTER SHOOTERS - If an oyster topped with Worchester sauce, fresh Parmesan cheese, spicy cocktail sauce and Tabasco, served in a shot glass sounds good to you order about 3 of them. If it sounds just ok or weird to you, try 1 just to see if you'll like it. If you don't like them here, you won't like them anywhere. They're cheap and oh so yummy. The clam chowder - ridiculously good, oh so flavorful...you won't be disappointed. The best thing here though is the CIOPPINO. If you don't like it, never, ever read any of my other reviews because you and I just won't get along. The bad: On the weekends and tourist season you might have to wait a while to get a table. The fish and chips are just average. The catch of the day is fresh, but nothing special. If you get an inside seat when it's busy it just feels like another fish restaurant...seriously, never eat inside, stand at the bar on the outside if you have to.",5 star rating,Benito D.
12/10/2008,"Los Olivos, CA","This is place is always P-A-C-K-E-D!  When my mom was visiting this was the first place we had dinner and it was ok.  I mean, it reminded me a little of Market Broiler in Fremont, fresh fish, cooked in very simple ways.  Still good, but no recipe to write home about. We got the clam chowder and it was fine.  the bread was good and our entrees were also good.  Overall, a very decent meal, just not like 5 stars and personally, I don't think they try to be a ""five star"" place but more of a locals place.",3 star rating,Ella B.
7/29/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","The wait was long (about an hour) on Sunday 2pm-ish but a nice elderly couple handed their bar seats to us so we were able to sit at the bar overlooking the harbor. The staff was amazingly chill, friendly, and courteous. The food was mm mm so good to make us forget about the little tiff we had trying to decide where to eat and the wait. We ordered the infamous garlic baked clam and although heavy with lots of butter, it was very very good. The fish and chips were the best I've ever had. The bloody mary didn't live up to the hype, but it was stiff and that's what mattered the most. At the end of the meal, I whipped out my credit card so fast (I like paying for meals that I thoroughly enjoy; I will not even budge when the bill comes at a restaurant I didn't like) my bf didn't stand a chance beating me to it.

8/4/2016,"Lompoc, CA","First let me say, I love Brophy's and go there every time I'm in Santa Barbara. Sitting at the bar is at a premium and I was disappointed when I could not sit at the bar on my visit at lunch on Wednesday and even more so when a woman and a 4ish yr old boy were taking two seats. First of all I don't think non drinkers should sit at a bar(especially children) because bartenders are working for tips and serving alcohol brings in more tips. Secondly, I was told the child was the manager's son and they always sit at the bar because the child likes to sit there. First of all, that's ridiculous when does a 4yr old dictate your seat;and secondly it was a very busy lunchtime and you're letting your son sit at the bar taking a paying/drinking patron's premium seat. And they sat there for an hour! Bad decision on the manager's part.",3 star rating,Sandra H.

I think they have a great thing going with the location but I wasn't impressed with the food at all.  We had, cioppino, fish sandwich, calamari and coconut shrimp.  Shrimp was pretty good everything else was fine, not bad but not anything to write home about.  I liked their wine list more than their beer list.  The place is super loud.  My review doesn't sound positive BUT I truly have nothing against the place I just don't think it lives up to the hype.  Great place for a beer (or wine) and some decent seafood.I also think the prices are super reasonable and the atmosphere is fun and lively!!!If you are in as a tourist its a great location.",3 star rating,Todd O.
7/27/2013,"Dayton, OH","Great location, right on the water! We visited on a Wednesday,  and parking was a nightmare. We ended up using the valet ($6). Establishment has seeting on upper deck and first floor. We sat on upper deck, and chose a table outside with a wonderful view of the dock and ocean. We were disappointed that all beer were bottles, no draft. Beer selection included locals such as Anchor Steam and Firestone Walker. Our beverages and complementary sourdough bread arrived in a timely manner. Food was fresh, and arrived quickly. I had the fish n chips. Strips of fish filet were thickly beer battered and fried to a dark golden brown. The fried fish was accompied by house made cole slaw, pre-made french fries, with house tartar and house cocktail sause on the side. Our waiter,  Matt,  was on top of his game and provided us exquisite service. He was always right on time with beverages, amd was happy to share his great knowledge of the menu with us.

7/21/2011,"Portland, OR","3.5 stars  -  Santa Barbra is too expensive for me to stay in so naturally I was skeptical of a two dollar sign place that literally hangs over a yacht  filled harbor with a sun setting over the mountains back drop. How could this place actually be reasonably priced? and if it was it must be crap food.This I found out was not true. The view is great, the service is good, the food is about average, the price was fair and the wait was long. The we arrived at about 7:30 and waited about 50 minutes for a table for 2 (ok well I guess not too too long a wait). I had the swordfish which was well grilled. Thankfully not overdone and pretty moist. The problem is it came with a side of aioli sauce that was good but unless you smothered it with the aioli it was a little bland, especially because it came with equally white and more bland rice pilaff and cole slaw.But what really failed to impress was the oysters. The tasted like nothing. They were totally non salty and only a little hint of creaminess but overall really bland.Maybe I am being unfair since this is a great deal considering the location of the place and the fact the food isn't horrible but I struggle to give anything more than a 3 stars if the food was just ehhh.",3 star rating,Alex S.

10/29/2011,"San Francisco, CA",There is a restaurant in Half Moon Bay called Crab Landing. Two level restaurant that is 3 years old. Mis management and so so food has closed it. It overlooks the harbor and can be seen with its seductive blue lighting at night from Hwy 1.The amount of Hwy 1 traffic alone would make it a magnet. This restaurant needs to be a Brophy Bros. It at least warrants taking a look and seeing what you all think. I am not a commercial realtor or with the Half Moon Bay chamber. I am a person who likes good food and likes to see those who create good food succeed.  I'm writing this as a way of starting an effort of getting the succesful owners of Brophy Bros Seafood restaurants to check out Half Moon Bay and the Crab Landing restaurant.,5 star rating,Anthony P.

5/24/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I give the Brophy Bros a 1 star because of the horrible customer service from the manager and a hostess by the name of kelly. I visited the restaurant today with my service animal and mother and was rudely greeted by kelly, who approached me with a very ""valley girl"" attitude saying, we don't allow dogs here. I mentioned that my dog was a service animal and she rudely stated, you don't look like you have a disability. How rude and unprofessional. At that point I asked for the manager who came out and stated that a lot of people have been coming in claiming that their dog is a service animal and essentially saying if you don't look to have a disability to need a service animal they will not let your service animal in. I could not believe the words that were coming out of either of their mouths, which was highly illegal. I asked for the name of the owner, he refused to provide it and he told me they had a paper that stated that the restaurant is allowed to ask what kind of disability you have. I have never heard that in my life. So I asked to see the paper and he took a long time trying to find it so I left. How disrespectful especially from a manager and his hostess.

The crab cakes, we're terrible. I suppose being from Maryland, an area who's only attribute is its crab produxts, I can be a snob... but these tasted like they came pre made from safeway. The blackened sea bass was burnt, there is a difference between blackened and burned. The mai tai was all clear rum and quite devoid of flavor. Kudos for attempting to get us drunk but we didn't order shots. The service was great, the only thing saving the second star. A plethora of attendants made us feel very well taken care of.

They have high chairs and booster seats... but that's about it. Since it's cramped, little ones have to be corralled with extra vigilance, which makes them even more antsy. And there's no kids menu. They do make a grilled cheese but it wasn't anything exciting... which leads to the 3-star review.The dish I had was ""meh"" at best. Wife's was better but overall, for $22/plate, it was disappointing. Their clam chowder is pretty good though.

We ordered a sampler of steamed mussels, clams, shrimps, and oyster Rockefeller. It was absolutely so fresh and delicious! For drinks, we ordered house red, bloody mary, and margarita...and our bartender really loaded my margarita with tequila and asked if I had any preference of tequila to use. After about an hour of wait, we got called upstairs and had our dinner outside with views of the harbor. Luckily, it didn't smell too bad - like Fisherman's wharf in SF does with all the sea lions so close...so you have the wonderful sea breeze and it is so picture perfect postcard-y. We started with some oysters on a half-shell which were traditionally served with cocktail sauce and lemon. Was delicious, but as long as you get fresh sweet oysters - you can't go wrong with the taste of fresh from the sea. We got a cup of clam chowder which was served in a Brophy's coffee mug served with oyster cracker. Now, I consider myself somewhat of an amateur chowder connoisseur from my days working at Pier 39, my trip to Boston (trying chowder from different restaurants every day I was there), and my trips to the Chowder festival...and their chowder here was definitely ranked up there with good chowder.The consistency was not too thick or watery.  The pototoes didn't overwhelm the chowder.  It wasn't starchy or floury...had the right amount of clam stock and was not salty at all.  It had big chunks of fresh and tender clams (not chewy at all).  The sprinkling of parsley gave it a freshness.By the time my meal came (seafood pasta) - I had to take it to go.  We were stuffed!  The pasta was creamy and light with scallops and shrimp.  The drizzle of fresh lemon cut through the heaviness of the cream with that touch of acidity.This is a place to go for a nice seafood experience.Would like to go back when it is spiny lobster season  and try their lobster.",4 star rating,JJAMZ C.
4/4/2014,"Miami, FL","We had a decent meal here. The seafood was fresh but nothing special. The portion sizes were a good size & the price was reasonable. The ambiance was bar like and the restaurant was small & crowded. Overall a good vibe though. Not romantic but still cool.My mahi with mango & papaya relish was nice, light, & fresh but nothing spectacular. I was happy with my selection. My husbands Cajun spiced sea bass was just ok. Very Cajun & smoked tasting, took away from the fish. The service... Terrible. My husband and I aren't hard to please in this arena. Lol. We asked our server for water and didn't get any for over 20 minutes! She walked by us so many times & ignored us, never bringing water, never taking our order. It was about 9pm & she was closing out all her current tabs at the bar & walked by us numerous times! We had just flown into LA & driven all the way to Santa Barbara sightseeing so we were sooo tired & hungry... And choking on our bread.. When she finally came over to us she noticed we were visibly upset... She had an attitude & was rude to us throughout our whole meal as a result! Pretty crazy because we didn't even complain. If we were back home we would have walked out after waiting 20 minutes and being obviously ignored so she could finish what she would rather be doing. But being that we were on vacation we had much more patience. So overall decent food, decent price, decent ambiance, terrible service.. This is not a restaurant to write home about. We will not return here if we are ever back in the area.",3 star rating,Denise S.

OH yum.  I wish I could eat it all again right now.The seafood salad had crab, shrimp, salmon, tomatoes, lettuce, and some other type of fish, with cheeses... it was also excellent.  I left this place extremely happy.It's also a plus that it's right by the water and you can go look at the crab's family that you just ingested.  They are happily sitting in the bay right by the restaurant.  The views are also awesome.  I love how the mirror in the back of the restaurant reflects the marina and mountains.It wasn't a five-star experience because it was SUPER loud, we couldn't really hear each other talk, SUPER crowded, you can't move without bumping into another patron/server, and the hostess was kind of a space cadet.",4 star rating,Stacey P.

7/26/2008,"Arcadia, CA","Brophy Bros, oh Brophy Bros... what can I say? You guys have the best chowder in Santa Barbara and some of the best I've had period. I lived in Santa Babara for about 5 years and this was the place I went whenever I missed a taste of Boston. The chowder was never too salty, and the ambiance couldn't be beat. Literally on the pier over-looking the water. Brophy's had fresh catches of the day to choose from, but I usually just grabbed the biggest bowl of chowder they had and went to town.Brophy Bros also did a decent Dungeness crab platter, and same for their fresh King Salmon... that's the problem it was just decent and it's what brought down my rating from a 4 to a 3 (it's more of a 3.5 honestly tho). Nothing spectacular and certainly nothing on par with their chowder. Additionally, I've had some of the worst wine ever at Brophy's, someone already mentioned it, but the chardonnay was disgusting (thank God I can't remember which one it was... or maybe not if I did remember I could save some poor unsuspecting soul). I'm sure it wasn't the particular maker--- more like it probably had been left to ""breathe"" too long.Having said that, if you find yourself in Santa Barbara (or within a 20 mile radius) go out to the Pier and get some chowder and (if necessary) wait for an outdoor table and just relax with some great food and views. You won't be disappointed.Btw, lot parking (if I remember correctly the beach lots don't have the hour free that the downtown lots grant) so you'll have to pay. The alternative is to leave your car in a downtown lot and either walk (it's not far, State Street isn't that far from the Pier) or ride the beach bus (which is about a 0.25 one-way if I remember correctly). I'd walk, especially in the summer. Also the breeze can get pretty stiff at night, despite the heat during the day so layer-up if you plan on dinner or ask to sit (literally) right next to the heater if you want to eat outdoors.",3 star rating,Wonder W.

4/26/2010,"Cleveland, OH","Had to make a pit stop on the way to wine country from LA and it seemed that a little seafood getaway would be the right thing to do. As advised by reviewers I had the cup of clam chowder, which is just enough for you to really enjoy it and not get cream overload. The pieces of clam are larger than most soups I have tried but they were also more tender. One out of our party of five did find some grit in their cup which seems to be a recurring complaint. I guess when they are actually using fresh clams, instead of canned like most places do, it is inevitable for a little sand or shell to slip in.Instead of an entree, I ordered the hot combination appetizer plate which was a good amount of protein for one person without the added carbs of the rice or fries that come with the regular entrees. 2 garlic roasted clams which were nice and tender, two oysters rockefeller which were flavorful and creamy, and one big bowl full of steamed/boiled mussels, clams, and shrimp. The mussels were tasty and not chewy at all. The clams on the other hand were a little difficult to eat. Unlike the clams in the chowder, these were quite tough. The shrimp, as others have mentioned, were not shelled, and that means they were also not deveined. I peeled the shells off by hand and then just tried not to think about the deveined thing. They tasted fine and I didn't get any weird grit but the principle of the thing still bothers me.Overall a good selection of nice fresh flavorful seafood. Two of my clam preparations were tender while one was rubbery. I would go back again to try some more of their fresh fish selection and possibly the raw apps as well.",4 star rating,Dustin T.

The Halibut and Salmon meals were modular in appearance and once again there just wasn't any flavor to either dish. The pasta seafood similarly didn't taste like much to my son. My son is very forgiving when it comes to food, so if he's not liking something like mixed seafood pasta, this is really bad news.The calamari appetizer was also tasteless, poorly seasoned - frozen food.I can see plenty of glowing reviews of this restaurant - I'm mystified.

Given the freshness of the fish, the prices are very reasonable.  I tried the oyster shooters, fried calamari and blackened sea bass (which my server informed me was local), and all were delicious!There's a full bar with a great selection of beer and wine, neither of which are over-priced and the margaritas are superb.  The view of the coastline and harbor are great from this 2nd floor restaurant.  One piece of advice: there's a ""Clam Bar"" downstairs (that is part of Brophy Bros), which is the perfect prelude to dining upstairs if there's a wait, or even if there isn't!  We stopped in to get drinks and appetizers while we waited to be buzzed for a table upstairs.  The atmosphere was lively and they had a very friendly, cute bartender who took great care of us.Overall, I rate my experience a 10 out of 10 and would highly recommend this restaurant to family and friends.  One final note: supposedly the burger and fries, and the steak are really, really good, if you're not info seafood or just feel like some red meat.  My friend got the steak and said it was better than most steakhouses he'd been to.I'll definitely be back!!!",5 star rating,Gafar U.

OK, so food.  5 stars for their steamed mussels.  The broth is yummy and mussels are super fresh!  Must item.   Good oyster and other seafood.Price is right for their freshness and taste and location.  Not the cheapest but very reasonable, which I liked.  ($12 for steamed mussels, and $9 for fish and chips to give you some idea)With a few drinks, total comes out to be around $50+ for two.  Not too bad.

8/27/2010,"Oakland, CA","Great location right by the habor. Can get busy so plan on going a little before or after the rush hours. Service is a friendly and the waitresses all wear hot pants, which almost makes me want to give it another star, but that might not be objective.Anyway the clam chowder is downright amazing, I always get a cup of that. Entrees can range from delicious to average so maybe ask for a recommendation but honestly even average is good if you're a seafood fan. It's not like you're paying for Michelin-rated plates. You'll still leave satisfied. It is a bit too crowded and if you sit in the wrong seat you might get a little bump every now and then from waitresses or general traffic moving around but can't blame them considering the real estate.

12/5/2010,"San Diego, CA","As a self proclaimed clam chowder connoisseur I give Brophy Bros very high marks for theirs. It arrived at the table piping hot, full of flavor with tender chunks of potato, and plentiful amount of clam. It was thick and creamy - not runny. And the sourdough bread to go with was very good.The grilled shrimp skewer was excellent - very flavorful and grilled to perfection. The service was also good.The only cons would be:1) Beer selection was lacking; only a handful of bottled beer and nothing on tap.2) The coleslaw - it was irritating how good it looked and how bland it tasted. It was like it was on the edge of something great, but was missing that little something to push it over the edge. Each time I tasted I kept thinking maybe it just didn't get mixed up in the bowl and would surely stumble onto an area of flavor, but it never happened, so that had to stay behind.Overall, a nice place to grab some decent food.",3 star rating,P F.

8/23/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Sally Spork (local SB foodie) reviews BropheysAtmosphere: We sat on the bottom floor of the restaurant. It is a small bar with tables were you can get some appetizers, basic menu entrees and drinks. Flat screen tv playing sorts and long mirror to create illusion of more space. Nothing special or unique. Service: We got the last seats/table as we were there in the peak of tourist season (Aug.) Last time I went (with a friend who was visiting from Arizona and wanted to eat near the water) we waited about 2 hours on a wed. night. The server was friendly and quick. The food/drink served pretty speedily. She checked in on us after served. Food/drink: Wanting more than a snack but not an entree we craved a burger, we asked her about it and she said, ""It's really good: in fact people come in just for the burger."" Sold: we ordered it with a cup of chowder."" So was the burger all that? After one bite Sam said the patty was not fresh but a frozen one. It was dry, flavorless. Chowder was good, hot and tasty.Summary: Brophey's. Honestly, I have only been here twice only on the insistence of a companion who wanted to eat by the water. I have a saying, which this visit confirmed: Never eat by the water of any beach town. The eateries rely on the volumn of tourists and don't need to rely on quality of food. Brophy's is no exception. Needless to say, I won't go back.",2 star rating,Sally Spork S.

9/8/2017,"Sun Valley, Los Angeles, CA","My experience as a first timer wasn't the best. When I went it was pretty busy so they gave us a pager, when the table RSVP was ready we would get buzzed. I asked, ""How long do you think the wait would be?"" and the hostess replied, ""30 minutes or so"". I decided to walk around to kill time. 10 minutes later the pager went off and I got excited because I didn't expect to get in so early. I went to turn in my pager and the hostess said it was an accident that I was buzzed. Mind you, you have to walk up stairs in a tight space to get to the restaurant. She wasn't even apologetic at all. Anyways, now about the food. It was OKAY. I've had better. I love to use Yelp to pick places to eat at and this place really disappointed me. I ordered the calamari which is suppose to be a popular dish is wasn't that great. I also ordered the hot combo and I wasn't impressed, there's nothing special about the food or authentic at all.

We chose to sit outside on the balcony overlooking the harbour and the beautiful salty smell of the ocean was divine.We started our meal with the Clam Chowder that was to die for. It was filled to the brim with big chunks of fresh seafood and vegetables. The chowder was lighter than normal which worked, and allowed the natural deliciousness of all the fresh ingredients, a complete balance.The salmon I had was cooked to perfection. It was accompanied by one of the tastiest Cole Slaws and was topped with a rich creamy aioli that I felt complemented and did not overpower. The Mahi Mahi that my friend had, with smoky blackened cajun spices, cooked flawlessly with a little melted butter on the side to drizzle, just melted in your mouth.

We saw the good reviews on yelp and we saw on their website that they were voted the best seafood restaurant in the area so we decided to try it out. We ordered their famous backed clams, it tasted good but it was kind of rubbery (I think it might have been undercooked). We also ordered the oysters which were not fresh at all, the worst oysters we ever had!We then shared the grilled seafood platter; a grilled combination of 2 large shrimps, one scallop and a small salmon fillet with a couple of sides. The shrimp and salmon were OK, nothing special,  but the scallop was RAW!.If you want to come here for the view, then it might be worth it they have a nice view of the harbor; but if you think you will get high quality seafood then think again!Update:I have to say I was surprised to receive a message on Yelp from the owner of the restaurant who apologized for my not so great experience,  and offered to invite us back as his guests.I'm definitely impressed with the quality of their customer service which may be the reason I'm willing to give this place another try.

8/9/2010,"Recklinghausen, Germany",Brophies is a good place to have seafood in Santa Barbara. During drivind season it can be crowded in the evening hours. We gad to wait half an hour before we were assigned a table. They give you a pager to call you once a table becomes available. You have to leave your car keys as a deposit. Some guests do not like that at all.Prices are in the medium range for SB.,4 star rating,David P.
3/21/2011,"Beverly Hills, CA","Ambiance/Service:The setting was beautiful.  We sat outside on the balcony on a beautiful day, overlooking the harbor.  I have to say that the ambiance is second to none.  The service was mediocre, but I attribute it partially to how busy the restaurant was.  I would say the only thing holding me back from giving Brophy's a perfect five star rating is the service.  Food:The food was excellent.  We started with a red snapper ceviche that was mouth watering.  The portion size was large enough for several people, so you definitely get your money's worth for this dish.  As an entree, my gf had the seafood cioppino and it was the best I've ever had.  The broth was delicious and there was no shortage of seafood in the soup.  I had the fresh swordfish which was preceded by their house clam chowder.  The chowder was delicious.  The swordfish came with a pesto aioli sauce, side of rice pilaf, and freshly made cole slaw.  The fish was delicious and had a nice sear on it.  The pesto aioli sauce was strong, so you only need a little.  The rice pilaf was good and the cole slaw was excellent. Wrap-up:Brophy's lives up to its reputation for having extremely fresh seafood.  Our meal was excellent, perhaps the best of our stay in Santa Barbara.  The ambiance is great, the food is excellent, and the service was acceptable, given how busy it was.  This is a must stop for seafood lovers.  Really, really, really good food.  Definitely coming back.",4 star rating,Larry C.

After selecting some postcards, I went to pay, and she rung me up. She asked me if I needed some stamps too (most people wouldn't care to ask). After I said sure, she told me that the international stamps were hard to peel off, so she went ahead and did it for me. It took a bit of struggle, so I guess they were hard to peel off, but she finally got it. Then she later pointed me where the mailbox was and also let me borrow her pen. She was the nicest cashier I met in a long time anywhere, and being this is my first time in Santa Barbera... I think I will always remember her friendless and beautiful smile.

2/25/2013,"Denver, CO","This place was pretty good. I was in SB for business and wanted to stop in for some fresh seafood. I ordered the sampler app and cioppino. The sampler was pretty good overall. I wasn't a huge fan of the oysters rockafeller, but its such a weird take on oysters anyway (I prefer them straight up raw). The cioppino was decently good. Not the best I've had, but the seafood was fresh and that goes a long way. The atmosphere was that of a dive bar. You can tell there were a lot of locals there, but they didn't bother you or anything .. it is what it is. I was able to sit out on the patio deck and the view over the water and dock was nice, though at night for me. The staff was busy and attentive and were always by to see how I was doing and there were enough that they were helping each other out.

We liked that they give you those pager-like things so you can wander the docks while you wait for your table. The service was quick and food came out HOT!

I couldn't ask for a better way to spend my Friday night than at Brophy's with family or friends. Heck you get treated like family just being here. As i sit here with my clam chowder, i recall a fond memory of coming to Brophy's with my dad. He said ""hey have you ever tried an oyster shooter"" at the time i barely knew what an oyster was before it was sliding down my throat with tomato sauce and some parmesan. If you want to make some memories and maybe even lose some to, there is no place better. Brophy's is like an old friend that never lets you down, you know the one with the great ocean view and the mom that makes amazing food. The price isn't bad and you couldn't spend your hard earned cash in a better way. As i finish my meal, i feel like a pirate and look down at the fishing vessels hauling in a fresh catch that will probably be served with some tomato sauce and some parmesan right here.

Drinks finally arrived about ten minutes later.  Ordered the chowder and salad ""special"" for an early dinner.  As others have reported, the sourdough bread was cold and chewy.  We've definitely had better.  HOWEVER, the chowder was delicious and lived up to the rave reviews. We could have done without the salad - it wasn't that great.  Bottom line: the chowder made the trip to Brophy Bros worthwhile.  Would come back for a nice hot bowl of this creamy hearty goodness!

We choose the covered patio as the view of the water at night is simply amazing. Besides the occasional cold draft, it was a great dining experience -- this has no bearing on my rating -- more to help explain my ordering the hot combination platter. Started with the combination platter with shrimp, clams. oysters, and mussels. This alone could have made me a happy camper and before I could finish, my order of fish and chips was presented. My companion ordered the cioppino and the seafood pasta. Imagine our whole table filled with seafood galore.

He got the fried scallops dish with cole slaw and french fries. The scallops and cole slaw: great. The french fries: not so great (and I LOOOVE fries, so for me to say they are bad is a big deal). They were room temperature at best and soggy.I got the oysters rockerfeller and clam chowder. The oyster: great. The clam chowder: okay. Def not the best bowl of clam chowder I've ever had. I'd give it a 3/5. Also - it was luke warm - not hot. Luke warm soup is never good- especialyl when it's cream-based. It really would have been better if it was hot.Another con- the dining room set-up. My husband and I were seated upstairs  - on the wall near the kitchen. Which wasn't the best seat anyways, but the frenzy of all the servers running by and bumping us was a bit annoying. It was bad enough we were next to the kitchen doors, but people were just running around frantically and not being careful enough of our table (and shoulders). Sure it means their turn-around time would be effected a tad - but I would suggest they take that one table up as it is really in the way. Overall I give it a 3.5.

When you order a cup, they serve it in a cup. A coffee mug, to be exact. Heavy on the clams and potatoes, their chowder has some real substance!I had the swordfish which is served with guacamole and salsa on top. it was perfectly cooked and the portion was perfect. I walked away full, but not STUFFED.This place will definitely be on my agenda next time I'm in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,John H.

I dug it, the server didn't miss a beat. I had the warm shellfish sampler, should have ordered two, it was lights out. I mean lights friggin out. I still think about that mother.I then ordered the swordfish. Problem is I don't like swordfish, I just though it would be better is Santa Barbara for some reason. Nope.

5/3/2011,"Goleta, CA","Big letdown! I had heard good things about it here so I was eager to try it but was soon disappointed. Although the clam chowder was very good (reason for the extra star), I unfortunately did not enjoy one more bite of food the rest of the meal. After not being able to decide with so many choices on the menu, I went with the server's recommendation and ordered the swordfish. Bad idea! No flavor at all and not completely cooked through. The fries were fine but that didn't make up for my bad swordfish at a seafood restaurant. Also the coleslaw was below mediocre. I thought for sure the bread would be good but that failed me too. All in all, I was not pleased with my food here whatsoever.",2 star rating,Rosie L.

4/14/2012,"Indianapolis, IN","You know a place is good when it's constantly packed. Known for their clam chowder and steam clams, this place offers so much more. Each table gets free sourdough bread as a starter! If you run out, ask for more! I had the seafood pasta. The shrimps, scallops, and white fish were all cooked perfectly in a white wine and butter sauce. It was served over a bed of fettuccine. Simple preparation done perfectly. Came with a choice of salad or clam chowder and fries or rice pilaf. I had the chowder and fries. The fries were crunchy and hot. The chowder included large chunks of fresh clams and noticeable cubes of potatoes. It wasn't heavy with cream, but just enough to add some body. More runny than thick. I've also had the Cioppino and crusted pan fried ahi. Both very good. Definitely get the steamed clams and a glass of CA beer (Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, and Firestone). Pints only $4.50! Brophy knows how to cook fresh seafood. A must visit when your in Santa Barbara. Free parking on the other side of the lot. Make a right from the entrance into the harbor parking lot. Another parking option is to park by the city park on Castillo and Shoreline and walk to the harbor. A nice day short walk on a beautiful day.",4 star rating,Pascual B.

They have the best clam chowder I've ever had in my whole life, and I've had a lot of them before. In fact, everything with clams is excellent here, steamed or their garlic baked clams. Their chowder has the perfect balance of clams, potatoes, and creaminess in every bite. Come here for the clams and you will not be disappointed. Besides the clams, their fried calamari, fish and chips, and cioppino are also pretty solid. The only negative about this place s the wait and service. They are always busy and their service was kind of slow the few times I've been there. It's worth the wait not to miss the best chowder in the world. A+++++",5 star rating,John H.

Worse than fast food fries. I should've order the garlic baked clams instead.

I, of course, took liberty to nibble from his plate.  The battered fish is to die for!!!

8/15/2011,"Woodland Hills, CA","Poorly Managed.  Bad customer service.From reading some of the other Yelp reviews, there seems to be an on-going management problem here. Many complaints with the hostesses, Service.  (Similar reviews... Kay Y. same story, Elvira G., Karen W., Lisa R., J. R. we might have had the same bratty brunette) happy o., B L.,nick b., Margarita V.This was the single worst experience I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  Our family put our name in for a table of 4 and waited the expected hour wait.  My parents are locals and knew the restaurant is notoriously busy.  The pager went off, we closed our tab downstairs and came up to be seated.  The hostess led our party of 4 to a table for 2.  We pointed out that we could not fit there with 4 people, meanwhile there are two empty 4-seater tables to our left and right. We asked if we could sit at one of the appropriate sized tables and she got angry at us and told us to stand on the crowded deck while she went off to figure out the situation.  As we stood there on the narrow balcony, we were pushed around by passing people... It was very uncomfortable.  She returned and  told us that they had given us the wrong pager and that we would now have to wait just under another hour for a table.  We could see that the party of 4 who had put there names in just before us, were now finishing there meals... When we explained that we had waited the time that was expected and did not want to wait the same amount of time again... she was extremely rude, so we asked for a manager.  A few minutes later, a guy shows up and instead of helping us solve this issue, he accosted me, standing only a few inches from my face, repeating himself at a raised level for everyone else to hear, that he ""Would Move us up in front of ALLLLLL of the many people waiting"" (which I can't imagine how many people were between our party and the party now finishing their meals who were right in front of us, considering they don't take reservations.)  Now, everyone was giving us a look as if we had not waited for a table. It was embarrassing, but I guess he was successful in ridiculing us for the mistake that his hostesses had made.   We said fine, please just seat us.  I turned to my family and asked if we could please dine somewhere else.  The manager then turns around and rudely states ""Why don't you all just listen to your daughter.""   My father says, please just seat us.  After we were seated the manager then circles around as I was on my phone and rudely states ""Well, just leave your review then.""  As angry as he was, I expected he might spit in our food, or circle back with another rude statement, so was I afraid to order anything.  The waitress we had was very friendly, but delivered our food without silverware, and didn't offer any wine glasses as we had brought our half bottle from the bar downstairs.  I found out that the managers name was Scott.  Will not be going back here.",1 star rating,Katherine B.

The chowder was good (and this is from a Bostonian!), not over salted and there was a good amount of clams in it. The wine list is pretty decent and the full bar make it a nice place to wait. Our bartender was handling it all and he did great. We finally got our table and ordered. The dinners come with a small salad which was mostly lettuce. I had the local halibut which was tender and juicy but kind of bland. My husband had the salmon which was also good but kind of bland. The place is good, but I don't get what all the excitement is.

My husband and I both had entrees from their limited menu. I got the seafood pasta and it was very oily and my shrimp were way overcooked. My husbands meal he said was O.K but nothing great. I really do not get all the love this place gets. Our service was O.K not great. My husband remarked that the hostess must be having a bad day.

Grandparents said their shrimp and burger were good. The service was good and attentive. So why the 3 star review? a) Not old people/handicapped friendly. You must climb a decent flight of stairs, because there's no other way up. b) No bathrooms! There are bathrooms in the store downstairs, but as of this review, they are being remodeled. So no bathrooms. c) The tables are not big enough. A table seats 4, but really, doesn't seat more than 3 comfortably. d) if you're sitting at the tables inside, there's no view. If you want a view, you must sit outside or at the bar.

4/28/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","In terms of food this place is completely unremarkable (2 stars). I am convinced that  the ambiance--amazing view of SB and ocean, fun vibe, friendly staff--psychologically fools people into believing that the food is good. Hence the 3 stars.I'm a long time resident and have gone to BB multiple times, always at the behest of my friends.  The entrees for the most part are just ok.  The cioppino is the worst--I swear it's Campbell's tomato soup blended with tomato paste, with a few overboiled pieces of seafood tossed in. And the beer boiled shrimp is completely tasteless. The cold dish appetizer dish and oysters shooters are really the only things worth getting.In comparison to seafood restaurants in the Pacific Northwest,  the places in SB are pretty mediocre. HereThe FisHouse (good cioppino with huge chunks of seafood) and Fish Enterprise Co are better options than BB and have more tasty food. Go for the ""experience"" of going to Brophy's which is fine.

The clam chowder that came with the dinners (or you could have salad) was delicious.  Rice or fries and cole slaw also came with each dinner.  All were decent.  Our waitress was a bit slow, but the place was crowded so I don't blame her too much for that.  And, she was always friendly.  Next time we are in Santa Barbara, we may go here for lunch.  But, probably won't go back for dinner.",3 star rating,M T.

Our other entree was cioppino whcih when I inquired about the ingredients ... was told that it contained no crab and saffron was not part of the recipe.

Glad we made the call with two for 3 people .... boy were we full!  Only downsider things I can say is that years ago they used to provide blankets for when the sun and heat went down... they no longer do that.  Also the pager that they provide for you is only good for a limited distance which means you can't go for a far reaching  stroll out past the flags and breakwater or you will miss you call to dine... do wish they would take cell numbers instead... the seals were entertaining.  Prices here seemed fair ... my comparison is Fish Enterprise which I love ...",4 star rating,Linda K.

They'll EXCEED your expectations....Ok. Here's the deal, DON'T let the busy restaurant fool you. Downstairs, at the smaller bar area (where appetizers are served) I was never more disgusted by the lack of attention. The guy who originally served us drinks was helpful, friendly, but then when we needed more assistance (drink refills and our BILL) the girls blatantly ignored us--but they certainly had NO problem yapping it up with a guy who appeared to be the manager or the owner when he stopped in with his friend and their dog. I also liked how I gave the blonde waitress the money for the drinks but she returned the change directly to my boyfriend. WHAT? Um. Did you not notice that I HAD PAID???? This is the kind of mentality that turns fantastic potential (a waterfront bar serving up a pretty good menu) into ZERO potential. It clearly caters to a younger crowd that has never known good service...or could care less about it.Sorry, I don't do places run by bratty 20-somethings that have NO concept of working hard or customer service.

3/5/2012,"Chicago, IL","A friend that lived in the area recommended this place to us, and my sister and I will never forget it.  There was a bit of a wait when we were here Friday night, but it was worth it.  We got to sit along the outdoor area upstairs where it was heated by the lamps above, so we got to appreciate the nice view at night.  I wish we had gotten here earlier to enjoy the sunset, so we'll have to do this next time.  Both my sister and I have a boyfriend that does not eat seafood, so we went to town!  In fact, our waitress asked us if we knew that we were ordering for 4 or 5 people, while my sister and I looked at each other letting her know that it was quite alright.  We shared the cold cut appetizer and the shrimp and crab salad, which was huge and delicious.  We still talk about how delicious this was.  Both our entrees came with the new england clam chowder soup, which was very good as well.  My sister doesn't even care for this kind of soup, and said she really liked it.  It had to be one of the best I've had as well.  By the time we got to our entrees we just ate the seafood as we were stuffed. It was hard to appreciate because we were just so full.  I wished we had room for desert, and was glad we didn't fill up on booze because I prefer food over drinks! The prices were just right, and the service was warm and friendly as well.",5 star rating,Leang E.

He was busy but very real and not overbearing at all. I ordered the clam chowder (ugh, so good) and was able to get crab cocktail (it's not on the menu, my server suggested it when I said I didn't want to go through all the work of cracking dungeness crab legs). The crab was OK, nothing to complain or write home about (they have local options on the menu but this wasn't one of them). My friend ordered a burger and she liked it. The busser who brought us our bread was a busy bee, always running around doing something. Definitely come here if you want to eat in the harbor area!",5 star rating,Adrienne R.

9/10/2007,"San Francisco, CA","Santa Barbara is such a sexy little town.  Walking on the beach, eating seafood with your hands; body, mind and spirit connected through nature.  No phones, no laptops, no deadlines, nary a stitch of clothing if you so prefer.  All you need to think about is your next margarita. On the rocks or slushed?  Such hard choices. I really wanted to enjoy Brophy's.  I heard great things about it from online reviews and locals alike.  The place was packed with cougars (my new goal when I grow up) and lemmings.  In fact, a cougar's derriere was positioned real close to my date's face the entire dinner.  Lemme explain.  Their outdoor seating also serves as an outdoor bar.  So sitting diners and standing happy hour'ers are all mixed together in a long, narrow ledge overlooking the harbor.  Once the place gets packed, it's bootie galore in your faces.  So if you're into that kind of thing, you're in luck. Thankfully, said cougar's butt was very pert and munchable, so no harm there. Their seafood was fresh, what with the fish and oysters just right around the corner, waiting to get caught.  But I wasn't impressed with the way they were cooked (or uncooked as was the case of our raw plate)  nor presented.  The spices were bland and uninspired.  The plating was haphazard.  And my biggest disappointment - the beard on the mussels weren't taken out prior to cooking.  I understand they cook by the pound and don't have the time to clean every little morsel, but when you find a hairy thingy on your mussel, I dare you not to think of sex.  No, not the good kind.",3 star rating,Janice N.

The restaurant is in the Marina Harbor and has outside seating, overlooking the boats and a small pier.Each entree comes with a choice of soup, salad and 2 side dishes. We could not resist the freshest delicious oysters of which we had a dozen  and wanted more, but decided to take control of ourselves. Main courses: mine was tender fresh Mahi Mahi prepared just right, preserving all the flavor. My friend ordered cioppino- also delicious.No dessert was necessary after this meal and later we found out no dinner was necessary either after such a filling, wonderful lunch.",5 star rating,Walker H.

8/19/2009,"Huntington Beach, CA","The first time I ate here was a lobster season and I was genuinly impressed by the delicious lobster that I've eaten here.  However, the second time, when I coulnd't wait to come to this restaurant again, was not a lobster season and thus I've settled for a Fettucini Alfredo with Shrimp.  I've received a huge portion of egg noodles in a mediocre alfredo sauce with FOUR (!) shrimps!!!  Now these were not the jumbo nor colossal shrimp to justify the small number - these were your usual medium size (about 4cm long) shrimps!!!  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  Luckily for Brophy Brothers, I was already on my second martini (on an empty stomach) so I was too buzzed to care to complain.  But still...  Needless to say, I'll only come here during the lobster season.PS  If you are about to jump for joy that you've scored an outdoor seating with the marina view, beware because as you're sitting down, your face is at the same level as people's asses who are standing next to you ordering drinks at the bar.  This is due to the fact that the walking ""alley"" between you and the bar's ledge is super narrow.  If you're planning on a romantic outdoor seating, be sure to scout your seats carefully (there are some seats that are not near this bar situation) before you sit down otherwise you might find yourself in an awkward/angry situation when you want to tell those rowdy drunks to mellow down and shove their asses into somebody elses' face.",1 star rating,Jana F.
7/27/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","Been here about 4 times over the past 4 years or so and each time has been a 3 star event, no more no less. What you can expect: good fresh fish, tables so cramped the waiter hits you with a tray every time he/she walks by, great views of the bay, decent menu selection, boring side dishes, no creativity, and about an hour wait for a table. I recommend trying this place for lunch to avoid the dinner lines. There is a (small) downstairs for a few people to cram in and get drinks from while waiting. Not a great atmosphere down there and the bartenders are not exactly attentive. I'm not to sure why anyone would ever rate Brophy Bros. 5 stars. It's a solid 3 stars every time.

We weren't too concerned with the view, just the food. Service was fast and tentative, with how busy the restaurant was, they kept our drinks filled and was available with anything we needed. The calm chowder was the best I've had. A lot of the time with clam chowder is that its too salty, but the seasoning was just perfect. The seafood pasta had plenty of scallops and shrimp, it didn't come with coleslaw or fries, but it really didn't need any side dishes. The pasta stands on its own.",4 star rating,Si O.

There isn't a bad item on the menu and if you don't agree then don't go, it will just ensure that I get a seat at the bar sooner.

12/28/2007,"Los Angeles, CA","Beware, be afraid, and tell others the same:  Brophy Blows. I read the reviews and from my findings this place fared better than most seafood restaurants.  But I was mislead.  Either those that chart a course for this place are from some land-locked state and care to tell about it in the same manner they talk about pickup trucks and hunting trips---in other words high esteem.  Or more likely, as I discovered, those that can tell a clam from a rock would rather forget the whole experience all together and never speak of it.  Well I am.  This place rolled up on shore in a red tide.  The food is appalling and possibly dangerous, if not deadly by FDA standards.  I think they know this, so they cook everything in an autoclave.  Forget about their oysters.  I've bought far better in MacArthur Park out of a dirty cooler from a toothless illegal.  Maybe old-man Brophy should explore some vendor options and stay-out of Wal-mart's frozen seafood aisle.  The service is not even worth commenting here, unless your a frat guy wanting to hook-up with a Russ Meyer-esque blond from UCSB, then by all means, service was fantastic.A total waste...I want my time back.  Words are truly inadequate to express my distaste for this slop shop.",1 star rating,justin m.

12/27/2011,"San Antonio, TX","Hmm...I told my friend I would give this place a 4 stars...but since I got sick from their not fully cooked scallops, sorry, I have to deduct a star.Our friends recommended this place for dinner.  This place is really crowded!  A minimum of an hour wait, even if you go early like 6 pm.I was debating between the sea bass and the jumbo skewers plate since I love both sea bass and scallops!  So, scallops edged out and I decided on the skewers plate.The scallops were really disappointing.  It was not cooked fully and not even camelized at all!  Scallops should be carmelized for fantastic flavor.  It tasted really weird, like it it was still raw and pretty disappointing.  The skewers also had pieces of salmon on it, which was pretty good.  I think the salmon and the scallops did not cook at the same rate and somehow the salmon was cooked but the scallops were not.  At night and the next day, I felt kinda sick and I think it was due to the scallops.  I tried a piece of the sea bass and it was just ok.Best thing about Brophy Brothers:  CLAM CHOWDER!  Yum.  It was hot and delicious, served in a ""coffee"" mug.Kinda pricey but it is seafood, after all.  You get a nice view of the SB harbor/pier/boats.",3 star rating,Joyce Y.

11/1/2007,"Santa Barbara, CA","By far the best thing about Brophy's is the view and the atmosphere.  It is a great place to come after hiking.  The best place to sit is either outside or at the bar (there is typically a longer wait for a table outside, but it is worth it if the weather is nice).  Many people have mentioned the garlic baked clams and clam chowder, these are my personal favorites.  The cioppino is also good especially when ordered over a bed of rice.  As far as the rest of the food, I've found it to be mediocre - there are much better places for fish in SB.",3 star rating,Paul H.
8/28/2010,"San Leandro, CA","Where do we start....best clam chowder EVER. I have been coming to Brophy Brother's for 20+ years and it has always been amazing, consistant and a family favorite.One of my friends had never had clam chowder before and the other friend had only had the stuff in the can. So when we were immediately seated for and early dinner, my dinner companions had no idea that they were about to have a taste bud explosion of amazing deliciousness!The bowl clam chowder  and salad for $10 is a great deal. You get a large bowl of chowder with fresh melt in your mouth clams and a nice sized side salad with cherry tomatoes and their house Dressing, a ranch garlic Parmesan . The dressing is so good, and also good for dipping fries into. I have also ordered the crab salad,amazing! And the tuna melt, which is quite possibly my favorite tuna melt  ever, besides the one I make myself. I do make a killer tuna melt! but this is a great option without all the work! Always fast friendly and efficient service, once you are seated. Peak hours can be a long wait so be prepared to wait, but know that it is worth every second. bring a jacket or a sweater and walk out on the break water and enjoy the amazing view of Santa Barbara. Or avoid the wait and come for an early dinner or late lunch.As for my clam chowder amateur friends, they were both in heaven as they sat there savoring each bite of their clam chowder.

6/10/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","My fiance and I ate dinner here while on a mini vacation in Santa Barbara.  Our hotel concierge recommended it as probably the best most popular fish place in town.  Sounded good to us.  When we arrived we put our name on the list and got our buzzer.  When we were quoted a 45 minute wait, we were pleasantly surprised since the concierge warned us of a potential long wait.  When 45 minutes were up we decided to check in because we'd drank lots of wine that day and were HUUUNGRY!  The hostess informed us after already waiting 45 minutes that we'd probably have to wait an additional 30 minutes.  WHAAAAT??  At this point my hypoglycemia was setting in and I wanted to bite someone's head off.  I didn't.  Instead we made our way downstairs to order an app to tide us over.  Of course once we ordered our buzzer went off.  Oy.  I headed upstairs in a hurry to make sure they wouldn't give our table away, and the fiance stayed behind to make sure that the app. we paid for made it to us.  The app. was ok it was baked clams with garlic and cheese.  A little on the salty side for me, but some may like it.  For dinner I ordered the seafood pasta (per the waitress' suggestion) and he ordered the crab cakes.  We both chose the salad with basil vinaigrette.  The salad was delicious though I'd want more tomatoes with mine.  And, the basil vinaigrette was very very tasty.I sampled his crab cakes and they were good.  However, my pasta was the bomb.  And, I'm really tough on Italian food.  The pasta was cooked and salted perfectly, and topped with roasted garlic, shrimp  scallops and a bit of grated cheese.  I was very very happy after this filling and delicious meal.  We were both stuffed afterward so we passed on dessert and soon thereafter passed out at our hotel.  I'd definitely eat here again, but probably not go on such and empty stomach.Special note for those that have certain dietary restrictions: make sure you ask what's in whatever you're ordering.  Though not noted on the menu the clam chowder is made with bacon.",4 star rating,N A.

There are a lot of clams in your soup which is rare...usually they put a lot of fillers like potato in it. We also had the beer battered shrimp platter for $9.75. The shrimp is fresh once again and plump...and the batter just melts in your mouth. It is seasoned just right.

He ordered an apetizer of Ceveche. It was enough that our party of 5 each had a small serving. The server comped us plus my Nephew's beer.Our table also ordered Calamari and there was plenty for the whole table. It was very tender and the dipping sauce very tasty. I ordered the Mahi Mahi. It was cooked to perfection. Not over cooked at all. My filet was very moist. The others had Bass and they were just as pleased as I was.

The views of the water outside are beautiful and I'm sure dining like that is sure to earn a couple stars at least. But we dined indoors on a busy hot night with a full house, not a good combo. Within seconds I was sweating and it took awhile for our food to come. To start we had the combo platter which was fantastic. It had all kinds of seafood...it was the highlight of our meal sadly. I ordered clam chowder which wasn't ""clammy"" enough and thresher shark which was fishy and unappetizing.

5/19/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","We came for appetizers on our anniversary... Purposely came on the early side to avoid a long wait, and 4.30ish on a Friday was pretty good timing because we only waited about 15 minutes.  Of course it wasn't summer so maybe 4.30 in summer or a holiday weekend would be a different story.  I really like their oysters and thought they were good quality and hit the spot.  There was some variation in the size of the oysters- 2 were significantly larger than the others, but they all tasted great.  We loved the calamari and I would say it is one of my top 5 SB restaurant calamari dishes.  There are so many restaurants here in SB that it is hard to pinpoint the best, but Brophys was up there.  It seemed to be really thick on the calamari and light on the breading.  I could have ordered 2 if we weren't heading somewhere else for dinner later.  I didn't care for my drink but decided to drink it anyway as it was something I wouldn't normally order.  And if I had decided to send it back for a different one, I am sure they would have made another for me.  No complaints about food or drinks. Very satisfying oysters and appetizers.The view is amazing.  We sat around the corner on the side deck upstairs, which was much quieter and more relaxing than the deck that directly faces the boats, with less people standing and passing.  We will be back!",4 star rating,M Q.

Basically to repeat what everyone else has said about it- it's creamy, has amazing flavor and is full of huge meaty clams. Everything else I've had was good but not as amazing as the chowder. There's nothing better than taking in the ocean view while eating the best chowder ever. Be prepared for loud people on a Friday night and atleast an hour wait for a table. The nice thing is you can walk around outside while you wait because they give you a buzzer to hold that lets you know your table is ready.

We shared the the garlic baked clams, which were very good.  You could taste the butter and white wine, and the bread crumb topping was good.  Had to scrape all of the good stuff out of the shell after you ate the clam.I had the Cioppino.  It had lots of green peppers and onions, fish, mussels, shrimp, and a clam in a tomato base, all covered with Parmesan cheese.  I think it was meant to be more of a large appetizer serving, but was more than enough for me with all the bread and other appetizers.  It left that nice warm feeling inside, and as I drove back to LA, I wish I had some more.My wife had the crab cakes which very tasty and had lots of crab.Service was very good and all of the staff was very personable and nice.",4 star rating,Stephen S.

The hot combo plate was great, nice to try a little bit of everything but the baked clams were the best thing on that plate. As everyone says, the chowder is great with lots of big clams and potatoes. The fish and chips were the only thing that didn't wow us, the batter had an elasticity to it. Also they used basa and I much prefer the flavor of cod in my fish n chips.     On that appetizer plate we noticed that all but 1 or 2 mussels actually had meat in them.

7/1/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","I've been eating here since I was a baby. My parents always joke that I was conceived here. They taught me how to fight my way up to the bar here when I was seven. And trust me it is easier to sit at the bar than try to get a table. This place is always packed. The bartender always remembers us even though we only come a few times a year. (We would be here more but we live an hour and a half away). He makes a frothy chocolate milk for my brother every time. I wouldn't steer too far away from the seafood here. There burgers and pasta are good but it's the seafood delights that are the real palate pleasers. Also, very good oyster shooters here.

8/20/2016,"Santa Cruz, CA","So overcrowded, so funky, a little smelly on a hot day...yet the food is fabulous! Brophy Bros. was recommended to me by someone in the restaurant biz, so we waited for a lunchtime table even though I was initially turned off by the sardine-tight feel of the place. We scored an outdoor table, thankfully, but even that was challenging for me, as I dislike being hemmed in by people. The crowding issue is worsened by the fact that the restaurant allows drinkers to line up at the bar along the inside wall on the very shallow porch, so that the faces of nearby, seated diners are just a couple feet away from the butts of tipsy people, and then on top of that the servers are trying to push their way through the crowd...kind of awful, really. But once the food arrives it's all good. I had fish and chips -- awesome fish and forgettable fries. My husband had a drop-dead gorgeous, cold seafood platter, which included oysters, prawns, a generous portion of delicious ceviche, and maybe a few other things all heaped together. Probably enough for two people, or just my husband! Prices are high for the funky atmosphere, but the excellent seafood is worth it. Just don't come here if you are claustrophobic. Really.",4 star rating,No N.

My Dad turned me on to this place when he came to visit me while I was at UCSB. I've made it a staple of my SB diet ever since! The garlic baked clams are quite possibly my favorite food on earth and I never miss a chance to partake in the blackened mahi mahi. The inside/outside bar is very cool, especially on a warm summer evening and with an oyster shooter in each hand! Parking is limited but not bad. Sit outside if you can, even in the winter.

I got the blackened tilapia and boy did they send out a burt piece of fish. I asked the waitress to have another fish prepared. I wasn't trying to get cancer from eating that burnt fish. They were friendly about that. They serve a hefty cole slaw with their dishes, which I didn't like at all. In fact, I thought it was a waste to serve a mediocre side dish that didn't enhance the entree. We made the mistake of hitting up a tourists destination.",2 star rating,Gindy N.

I have to admit to not normally being blown away by the quality of Brophy's fish, but tonight I experienced the most perfectly-cooked seafood I have ever had in Santa Barbara. The Cajun Mahi Mahi was perfect. And this was on top of the fact that we had two perfect margaritas, one ""normal"" on the rocks and one straight up and ""traditional style."" PLUS...since my girlfriend was not perfectly in sync with the perfect traditional margarita, Audi (sp?) made sure he gave her the extras from every PIna Colata that he made the rest of the night.

2/2/2014,"La Verne, CA",Every time I come to Santa Barbara I eat here and have brought people with me for several years. I had a group of six for dinner Saturday night and because they dont take reservations knew we would wait. When we got seated one person from our group did not show up so we had five people. Four big guys and one lady. We got our water and ordered and then the hostess came over and said get up if you only have five we need to move you. What she did is take away one table and stuck us with a table for four. We had no room to enjoy our dinner getting bumped and I was not happy with the very bad attitude of the hostess.  What made the situation even worse was the table that the hostess took from us was not even used it stayed empty the whole time we were there.

I got the shrimp cocktail and paid $12.25+tax for 5 average shrimp and store bought marinara sauce.

However, they do have a bar downstairs, so you can grab a beer while you wait for a table.The food is very affordable, which probably explains why we ordered a buffet-amount of grub. Perhaps it was due to the copious amounts of seafood, but I can't remember if the food was good or not. Probably wasn't too bad since we gorged ourselves and nearly ate all of it. The indoor dining space felt a bit cramp and can get stuffy on a warm day. If you can swing it (get here early or wait an hour+), definitely try to snag a spot on their patio.",4 star rating,Law W.

(you leave them car key or id card for a pager). although we were pretty hungry but expecting great seafood, we hung around for a hour! We were lucky to have gotten the marina view seating outside, I guess that was the only GREAT thing came out of the 1 hr wait. The four of us shared a hot combination platter. Originally, we wanted to order both the cold and the hot but our friendly waiter thought that was too much and suggested getting only the hot. Okay, he was WRONG!!! It was the right portion but not huge at all, we could have finished half of the cold platter w/o a problem! the only thing I liked in the hot platter was the oyster rockefeller. I decided to go the exotic route and share a SHARK dish with another friend, really excited till I took one stab into the fish. I saw blood,, tasted one bite, very rare... arhhh..... here friend, you can have the rest... it came with choices of sides, coleslaw was very tasty! that's about it....  bread wasn't bad... unlimited..

Oysters are good too and you can't go wrong with the calamari with that zest of lemon over it. Only problem is that they don't take reservations and the place is really small. The bar takes more than half of the space. I wouldn't recommend going when its cold because the likelihood of you getting the patio is pretty high if its just you and a significant other. They have tarp-like things to cover the patio when it gets cold but there don't do the job just quite so you'll be getting cold drafts while you're eating. When it gets busy you might end up waiting for more than 1 or 2 hours. I still give it three stars because of that darn good clam chowder,3 star rating,Peter P.

I'm sorry to say that Brophy Bros doesn't stand a chance of stunning what with its exorbitant reputation and the expectation that that sets forth in motion.The little mug of clam chowder that started off the night with a plate of overly dense, spongy and dry sourdough bread was delicious-- milky, lightly smoky and briny with small, meaty chunks of clam and potatoes. Everything pretty much went downhill from there. The side salad is bland, and the shrimp and avocado salad is even worse: it's just like the side salad with some avocado and small, cold poached shrimp perched on top with a side of sweet cocktail sauce for about ten dollars more than the former. The cole slaw was the most atrociously unseasoned item of the night. The salmon was cooked perfectly but a bit on the bland side, and the mushroom-vermouth cream sauce was too cloyingly creamy. The side of rice of pilaf was similarly unseasoned and heavy, and the flecks of wild rice didn't retain any of the character that is supposed to make it special. Crab cakes were better than expected.What's strange about the mess of food we ordered that night is that alone they range from boring to just plain unpleasant, but I found that some combinations of the items proved to be surprisingly delicious. The salmon and rice were boring and heavy by themselves, but when paired together they made a delicate combination, complimenting the butteriness of the fish with that of the rice. Same with the crab cake and rice; I wouldn't bother with the fries, however good and crispy they are, because the rice goes so well with the fish.Service inside the restaurant was friendly, accommodating and attentive, but the front-of-house service left something to be desired.Few restaurants are ever worth a 1 1/2-hour wait as we encountered at Brophy Bros. on an early-ish Saturday night, and this is definitely not one of them. But I don't think the restaurant itself is trying to peddle an image unrepresentative of what you get; obviously everyone sees something that I don't. Next time I would order a fish dish and remember to pair it with the rice pilaf.",3 star rating,Nuri K.

The chowder was one of the better ones that I've had, but one thing I didn't lie about it was that it was a little gritty at times. Bite in and there's a crunch. It was a big portion. Would have been better if there was a breadbowl. The calamari was just like calamari I would get any where else. My waitress was a little snobby.

6/23/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Never again...let me say this once more Never again. Have been eating here for decades and have enjoyed there location in Ventura for around 2 years, the food has always been good and the service on the slow side. But today was the worst. We were expecting to wait as usual and was told the wait was at least an hour and a half. No problem. We were given a pager and told we had to stay nearby within 100yrds. Well we had 2 young kids so I explained this to the hostess and said we would walk the kids around come back in an hour, She said if we leave the area we will lose our spot and this was the restaurant policy.  She said she would speak to the manager to see what he could do. The person who came over said they were the owner. This as it turns out was a LIE.  I explained our situation to this gentleman who did not give me his name and he said that if we left and came back we would have to start over. I suggested to him that perhaps we can leave and if we were called we could just take the next table when we came back as to ask two young kids to wait for and hour and a half in a confined space would not work. ( when we go to the Ventura restaurant this is not a problem). was there anything that could be done.  This suggestion seemed to offend him and he began to raise his voice and said  no this was not acceptable as it was to much like a reservation. When he started to walk away, I asked the hostess if he was the owner and she said no. When I asked for his name and who the owner was this gentleman became upset that I caught him in a lie and came back. When I asked him again if he was the owner he said no he was not I asked him why he lied and he gave me the name of the owner and said we were through and now I could just leave and grabbed the pager out of my hands. He was extremely rude. I understand that a rule is a rule but come on, you do not need to be rude and why lie and claim you are the owner when you are not. You can at least be nice about it. No need to be nasty and lie about it. Seems as if the gentleman just wanted to exert his power and not provide any accommodation.  This is fine but be polite. I know the loss of my business will not place a dent in their bottom line but I will never go there again. We went next door to the Watergrill, there was no wait, the food came out fast, was hot and the customer service was awesome. The food there was spot on perfect.

8/21/2009,"Berkeley, CA","So I came to Brophy Bros. because I'd read a review about it and it was close AND it was either go buy some raw shrimp and complete my shrimp and ratotouille dinner, or eat out.  I decided that since I was going to go check out the Santa Barbara Fish Market, I might as well go and just eat at BB's.  I'm glad I did.  The atmosphere was festive and fun-noisy.  Of course, there were tourists there, but there were also some locals bellied up to the bar and lots of families.Their clam chowder is super delicious.  The soup was thickened but not paste, with a sweet, milky flavor, nice balance of onion, celery and potato and most importantly chock-full of clams.  I was tempted by their fried platters, but decided for their cold seafood platter instead (trying to not indulge too much in my secret vice of fried seafood and french-fries as I am not slim by any means).  I also ordered the oysters rockefeller (OK, I said not indulge TOO much).  The platter was large with some delicious raw oysters and clams.  The ceviche on it was OK, as were the boiled shrimp.  I wasn't a fan of the crab meat as it looked too shredded and out of a bulk-packing plant, as opposed to the lump Dungeness I was expecting.  My dining companions ordered from the specials and got the seafood pasta in a cream sauce with shrimp and scallops.  It was nicely done, but had a very large pasta to seafood ratio.  My other companion had a pan-fried California White Sea Bass with a pleasantly spicy, citrusy sauce.  He was not overly impressed with it, but I thought they had cooked it well.  It is a meaty fish, so easily under-done or over-cooked, but this one was still juicy (if not tender, as CWSB is, again, a meaty fish).  All of the seafood tasted fresh and there weren't any complaints, the food was good, but not overly memorable.The service, however, was stellar.  Our server was friendly and efficient with a wonderful, happy attitude.  Our food was delivered hot (which means promptly).  The other servers pitched in to deliver bread, water, and then bread two more times.  I love places like Brophy Brothers because while the food is not cutting-edge, it is certainly good value and the view is stellar.  It's just a fun place to go and get some fish and chips or a bowl of chowder and enjoy the beautiful SB weather.",3 star rating,Emily S.

We went early enough so that we didn't have to wait for an inside table (there was a wait for an outside table but we chose to be seated right away). My wife ordered the seafood pasta, I had the blackened Cajun sea bass, and we split a Caesar salad. They also give you a basket of crusty sourdough bread that is at room temperature.  I ordered an Anchor Steam beer, too.Our food was great.  My wife loved her pasta, which consisted of plenty of shrimp and scallops on a bed of linquine. My sea bass was blackened but tender and done just right. It came with rice pilaf and cole slaw, both of which were fine. The service was good, too.  Our waiter looked like Prince William.  When my wife told him that, he said yes, that's what he's been told.

Known for long waits, we were surprised to get a table outside with a front row seat for the holiday boat parade and fireworks this past weekend. After previous trips ordering pricier fish dishes, I was pleasantly surprised with my fish & chips this time around. Great flaky fish, solid fries and tasty slaw made for a great meal at an honest price. Go for the views, the chowder and the experience, but not for a special occasion.",4 star rating,Phoenix S.
1/2/2014,"Boerne, TX","My wife and I were visiting Santa Barbara and had heard this was still a popular place to eat.  We had eaten there several years ago and enjoyed it.  We went on a Friday for lunch.  When we arrived, we were told it was an hour wait and were given a buzzer.  We walked around the harbor area for a bit and then returned to find there was still a wait.  We went downstairs and sat at some empty stools on the outdoor patio.  The waitress approached us and  told us we would need to order a drink or we would have to leave the patio - that was her opening greeting to us.  We ordered two margaritas.  They were the worst margaritas I have ever tasted.  My wife couldn't drink hers.  When our buzzer sounded, we were taken to a table on the outside balcony.  The upstairs balcony is about 3 feet wide and soon filled up with people waiting for their table by drinking at the bar which has a serving window to the balcony. So if you are sitting at tables, you can enjoy your meal with other people standing against your table and their butts in your face.  The food was very greasy, bland and just plain bad.  This place is living off its reputation, but the food and atmosphere is now terrible.  I can see why the students would like it, but for anyone else I would suggest you frequent the many other good restaurants that Santa Barbara has to offer.",1 star rating,Mark S.

8/31/2011,"San Diego, CA","Because this place came so highly recommended, we had decided that we needed to stop at Brophy Brothers on our way up to wine country. My friends and I (3 couples total) arrived expecting to wait for a table; we were not surprised when we were told there would be a 1.5 hour wait. We were ok with the bad attitude of the hostess (sassy with a blend of too cool for school), and with the inattentive bartender (I almost had to shoot off a rescue flare to get her to look our way). None of this was a big deal; we were determined to have a good time. We continued to do so even after the disappointments started adding up - bland clam chowder that tasted like it was from a can was followed by bland main courses (ever heard of salt?). This is where things got really interesting. As I mentioned, we were having a good time. We ordered two rounds of drinks at the bar over the 1.5 hour period, then 6 people shared one bottle of wine upstairs over the long dinner. Not excessive by any means. Having said that, we were admittedly being loud - it's a loud place and we were dead center in the loudest area. When the manager (Danny) waved at us from a distance to please keep it down, we complied. We were ready to wrap things up anyways - the main course was over and no one had the courage to give this place a shot at dessert or coffee after such a disappointing meal. It was at that point that one of the members of my party saw the manager passing by and waived him over. He said something along the lines of ""sorry we were being loud earlier, but I need to tell you that my steak was very bland"". I'm guessing that Danny had a lot riding on that tasteless steak, because his reaction would have been the same if my friend had insulted his mother. His words were an exasperated ""whatever buddy - have a good night"" and he stormed off. Apparently not someone to leave bad enough alone, Danny continued to return to our table no less than 4 times. When he first came back, we tried to reason with him to find out why he had been so rude, and he only managed to escalate things at every step - he called my friend a jacka$$, and told us that we needed to leave, even though the only reason we were still sitting in this dump was because we needed our credit cards back. What proceeded was a heated exchange between 6 educated people and the most ill-prepared restaurant manager I've ever come across. Without any regard for us or the numerous other patrons that by now were clinging on every word, Danny managed to add fuel to the fire at every step imaginable, using language that Yelp wouldn't let me post. He even followed my group down stairs as we left and continued harassing us, as if we had caused this problem in the first place. I imagine that by then he was simply hoping to perpetuate the perception that we had started this mess, so he needed to ""escort the unruly group outside"".  At every stage, Danny had managed to do the opposite of what a well-trained professional manager of a supposedly sophisticated establishment should do when managing an unhappy customer. I use Yelp frequently and yet I've never left any feedback - Danny brought out the best in me. There really is no good reason to come to this place unless you're looking for pretentious employees, a long wait, poor service, absolutely tasteless food, and a not-so friendly exchange with Danny, who's exhibit A on the list of reasons why you don't make the bathroom attendant the manager...",1 star rating,Tony G.

I then walked around the bar looking for an empty seat since I was told those are first-come, first-served, and we weren't picky about where we sat. No seats were available at the bar, but no problem since we were on the list, right? We then had several of Dan's finest while leaning on the bar window ledge on the outside wall. I subsequently noticed several other same-size parties being seated who had given their names after I did. So I went back to the hostess, who admitted I'd given her my name but she said I'd walked over to the bar--as if my having looked for open seats somehow magically took me off the waiting list (?)...When further questioned, she then suspiciously changed her story and said there was another person with my same name who got a table instead. No apology, plus an even longer wait. It was irritating, unprofessional, and we almost decided to leave after our beverages.

However, the manager, unlike the wait staff, is a complete idiot. When I moved inside, the beligerent patron came up to the table again at which point he created a scene. The great wait staff escorted the man out of the place and the manager came up to the table to ask what happen.

I had the wild coho salmon and it was the BEST salmon i'd had in a long long time. the meat had a nice dark pink coloring but it was fresh and not at all fishy at all.  it was also cooked just right. my pet peeve is overcooked fish.  yum.  i almost forgot to mention that each entree comes with a bowl of clam chowder or salad, and a choice of cole slaw or fries.  the sides are HUGE, piled high. the best part of this was our total tab came to only $82 before tip. can't beat that for a generous plate of foodps- all the servers are young cute girls and the bussers are young cute guys. hey, no complaints here but they know how to sell good food ;)",4 star rating,joyce l.

Was it because it was in a touristy area?The clam chowder was good, nothing amazing but good - very much filled with clams if that's the measure you go by.  We split the hot sampler and were totally underwhelmed by the tastes.  Everything was good but not great.  The mussels, however, were down right bland.  I wasn't even moderatly tempted to dip my bread in the broth.  Also, what makes these BM's stand out? I'm so curious as to where their ""Best Bloody Mary"" title comes from, I don't even think it had horseradish in it, I think the garnish was a celery stick, maybe a lemon, or a rolled up piece of newspaper (joke).  Either way, next time I'm in SB I'll just stick to the downtown main area which has a host of great restaurants to choose from.  One a positive note, there wasn't a wait which would have added to my excitement to try the food and therefore deepened the disappointment, so, there's that.",2 star rating,S K.

2/22/2011,"Goleta, CA","I LOVE coming here with some friends to just enjoy the beauty of Santa Barbara. It's located on the wharf across from city college and boasts a beautiful view of the ocean. When I come here, I usually order the clam chowder and the steamers and enjoy a few beers or bloody marys. I've had some of their other food options and they're okay, but I would definitely recommend getting the clam chowder (best in town) and some steamers, get a few drinks, kick back and relax. When it's warm enough, sitting outside is the best and this is a great local's place that's fun for visitors too. The service is friendly although it can get rather crazy when they're busy and there's almost always a wait. Either way, it's worth it and it's definitely one of Santa Barbara's gems. I am so tempted to give this place a 5, but I can't honestly say that I enjoy that many of their menu offerings, but I do enjoy coming here a lot and would recommend it to anyone looking for seafood and a great time.

7/12/2009,"San Francisco, CA","This was one of the best meals we had our whole weekend in Santa Barbara.  I still think about the delicious oysters we ate here.  If I lived in SB this is where I'd go for seafood every time.  If I ever return I know I will not miss this place.  On the down side, because this place is so small the wait is very long and it was very noisy because every table was packed.  The service made up for these faults however.  I'm a fan of places that don't pile their tables so closely to one another so that was another so I think next time I would try coming on a slow night or odd time.  I rate this 4 stars for the food alone.  Its so memorable I think about it even a month after I ate here.",4 star rating,Natalie B.
5/15/2010,"Manhattan Beach, CA","After it being recomended by various wineries I thought I was standing by to be disapointed.  usually a place that is over-recomended is just some local flavor that used to be really good, and so everybody loved it, then they cut corners and people are too lazy to re-evaluate.  Not so at the brothers Bro.  Our server was ash(ly) who at seemed a bit stand-offish but quickly became a delight and very helpful.  The drinks were fantastic.  As James says ""I have one drink before dinner, and I like that to be strong and well made"" and the drinks there are.  The food came out timely, but not suspiciously so.  The oysters were not my favorite, but dont detract from five stars because I prefer south coast oysters, (apalachicola).  the food was delicious.  They didn't try to hide fish under layers of sauces or the like, and the food was near perfect.  The place is a bit crowded, so be patient.  Thanks again ashly.",5 star rating,Matthew P.

My only critism is the entrees come with Cole slaw which and when I pay $22.00 for a nice dinner I don't want coleslaw which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Maybe they could serve steamed vegs? Service was great ...we were attended to but not rushed. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and made great recommendations. Wine was reasonably priced. We enjoyed our amazing food and million dollar views. This place is very casual and can get crowded. I iwill return.,4 star rating,Kathy G.

6/4/2011,"Carson, CA","Came back to Brophy's again today and got the clam chowder again ofcourse. This time I came with my family and they loved it too. The chowder tasted just as good as it did the last time I went there. I didn't notice this before, but the food comes out incredibly fast, which is good considering you wait 30-40 min for a table. It was just as busy for lunch as it was for dinner the last time I came.My family and I split the calamari, and it didn't disappoint. Most places either over cook the calamari and make it really chewy, and/or they over bread/flour it. However, Brophy's managed to make it perfectly. I hate it when restaurants make calamari with thin strips of squid and too much coating, but Brophy's calamari had a good chunk of squid in it. The portions were good enough for the four of us. My family and I agreed that it was very tender, and had a nice light coating to it. I was a little disappointed with the scampi, because I thought it was going to be a pasta, but that was my fault for not reading and assuming it was going to be pasta. Overall another great experience at Brophy Bros.",5 star rating,Michael A.

4/13/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","There is no livelier an eating/drinking establishment than Brophy's. It's a favorite with locals and tourists, alike and there is usually a long wait for a table. The location and views from the second floor dining room and outdoor terrace overlooking the harbor and the mountains in the distance are spectacular. Brophy's is primarily a seafood restaurant though you can find burgers and chicken on the menu. They have developed a successful, though unexciting, formula for preparing seafood entrees over the years that allows them to serve a large number of meals per night but true foodies may be disappointed. The lively atmosphere and views make up for that. The choices of sides that come with the meal are cold slaw and rice or potatoes. Sitting at the bar (if you are lucky enough to find a seat) and ordering off the simpler bar menu with chowder, burgers and fish sandwices, etc. is preferable and less expensive. If you are looking for a lively place to have drinks with great views and a taste of Santa Barbara, I would recommend Brophy's.",3 star rating,C. Marie D.

5/7/2012,"Temecula, CA","My new favorite spot in Santa Barbara.  My wife and I waited for about 10 min for our table outside.  We sat in a small little table for two up against the railing looking out over the harbour that had about 50 small, medium and large sailboats tied to the dock.  Checking out the menu I noticed there were no IPA beers on the menu.  I grabbed a Bud Light for this sunny afternoon and called it good.  To start off lunch another server cruised by and rapidly dropped off a white napkin covered bread basket filled with hot, fluffy fresh sour dough bread and butter.  The butter melted very quickly on the soft inside of the bread.  Coming in I was pretty hungry so this curbed my appetite while we waited for the oyster shooters.  The oyster shooters came in a shot glass topped with a big glob of cocktail sauce, horseradish and freshly grated parmasean cheese.  It was good if you like to taste only the cocktail sauce, horseradish and parmasean cheese.  If you are used to eating raw oysters on the half shell with no toppings this is not for you.  Probably a great way for someone to try eating an oyster if they've never had it before.  I was leaning more toward the raw oyster on the half shell and wanted more oyster taste.  On the second oyster I just took out the toppings and ate the oyster which was excellent.  Next came the calamari which was crisp, lightly bread and came with excellent tartar sauce and cocktail sauce.  It was a pretty big portion too.  Next came the ceasar salad and clam chowder.  The bread dipped into the clam chowder was off the charts good.",4 star rating,Robert D.
7/2/2011,"Los Gatos, CA","Just had a meal at Brophy's -- my husband's favorite place to eat when he goes to S.B. -- and we won't go back again. It barely rates the two stars, and only does so because the fish was obviously fresh. We waited over an hour for our table; long, but okay if the meal is worth it, which it was not. We were seated on the balcony, which also serves as the restaurant bar (the first floor watering hole is just a holding tank). The width between bar and rail is maybe three feet, so it's you, a small path for wait staff to run through, and drunk, loud, obnoxious drinkers. My husband and I  could not talk since the two ladies and their gent were speaking so loudly. The gent's butt was in our faces most of the time, and all too often we were grabbing our drinks to keep them from being knocked over either by our pals or the wait staff and dining customers coursing back and forth. A waiter was somewhat chagrined when we asked him to ask the revelers to back off.  And only when we left did the bartender finally come out and tell them, ""Look, you're not in a bubble."" In fact, I feel sorry for the wait staff, who have to run interference all night long in addition to doing their job.  Brophy's apparently thinks its reputation will let it milk both drinking and dining customers. We're two who will not be going back.",2 star rating,Faith H.

8/11/2018,"Orange, CA","First time here.We came on a Saturday night around 5:30.  We had 2 adults and 3 kids. It was a 45 min wait.We ordered a hot sampler which had a variety of things from oyster Rockefeller, baked clams, clams in a white wine sauce, shrimp and something else. 2 kids meals, which aren't featured on the menu, pasta tossed in butter and topped with cheese and chicken tenders and fries. We also got the Cajun Sea Bass and fried calamari.  The Sea bass came with clam chowder, which was so flavorful and rich. It was super good! Our chowder was the first thing to arrive and with my kids being super hungry they dug in right away. After the entire cup of chowder was gone, we realized, we didn't receive any bread. So we asked our server who brought some out and we scraped the bottom of the chowder cup up with the bread. Then our calamari rings come out. That was fried nice and crispy.Then came the chicken tenders and fries, nothing special. Just  3 pieces of chicken tenders and fries. We asked for ketchup numerous times and we never got it. We finally got a guy, who I think might have been the manager, who was finally able to get us ketchup. Out comes the sea bass and the hot sampler. I thought the hot sampler was suppose to come out first being that it's an appetizer . The sea bass was moist and just enough cajun seasoning/flavor for it not to be overpowering. The hot sampler was all so delicious!The last thing to finally arrive was my daughter's pasta. Pretty disappointing knowing that, one, usually kids meals should typically come out first, and two, it was just pasta tossed in butter with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Why did it take so long to make???? Overall the food the was delicious and it came out fairly quickly, but the service and order of food lacked a bit. Maybe because it was busy.",4 star rating,Joy W.

And we got to watch Julia as she shucked oysters, clams, prepared cioppino and seafood dishes.  We had the 1/2 dozen oysters, and the locals favorite fish and chips and garlic baked clams- SO GOOD!

Definitely a heavier item with all the breading so it feels like you ate something deep fried once you're done with it.The oysters rockefeller, same thing, looked very appetizing with all the gooey cheese on top but needed some kick to it like cayenne or paprika or something.Cold combo was big!

Located next to the harbor, you can get a pretty good view if you sit outside. They have heat lamps out there so you won't get cold at night. Food: Portions were huge. You get what you paid for. We ordered 2 appetizers, and one entree each. Couldn't even finish everything.-Seafood Pasta- Awesome. Lots of seafood on it, and plenty of pasta. Really good.-Ahi: Seared on the outside, still raw on the inside. You get a small crunch when you bite into it. Then it pretty much melts in your mouth after.-Cold Combo Appetizer: Man, this appetizer is huge!! Great combination of everything. Great way to try out all their seafood. Recommend sharing with at least 3 people. -Oyster Shooters: Man I love this the best. 2.95 for one shooter, plus a dollar extra if you want it to be alcohol infused. And let me tell you, the taste is so intense. And the rush you get right afterwards, awesome! I have a high tolerance to alcohol. But just one shooter gave me a good buzz. Thumbs up!-Fried calamari: Good, especially with their dips. Nice and crunchy. Perfect texture. Overall, everything was good. I was not disappointed. Service was great.

For that, I've up'ed the star rating to middle of the road.When someone mentions Brophy's I'm always hesitant to open my mouth in protest. It's beloved by locals and tourists line up early on the weekends to catch a table on the patio and soak in the views. I'm not like the rest. The food is consistant as is the popularity and I've come to the conclusion, and will go, for two things: 1. Bloody Mary2. Clam chowderThis is a good spot to pop in after a sail to warm up with clam chowder or before hitting State St for a pre shopping Bloody with local, bar fly guys Harbor John and Cappy. The bar is preferred and you can usually at least find a spot standing at the windows on the desk. Oysters are fresh but I find the rapid shucking leaves shell bits floating and the often ordered beer boiled shrimp is ok but lacks the flavor you'd get from real seasonings.Now that I know what I like and dislike, I've stopped trying to make Brophy's something it's not, The FisHouse at the Marina.",3 star rating,Mark F.

We were first in line, but a few more groups came up right after to get in.  There's no reservations here (my only complaint), but there's a reason why. Seated dining is upstairs and small. Maybe 10 - 15 four tops and the rest is bar seating or 2 tops on the patio. Since the patio was narrow, our party sat inside. Decor is very harbor rustic. Fun! This is a fish and chips kind of place during lunch (not sure if menu is that much different for dinner), so don't expect anything fancy. But the place is clean, beatiful open view of the harbor, and the servers and staff were on top of it! It got busy fast, but we were always taken care of and dirty plates were cleared often. Food was fresh and plenty! Large portions! Reviews rave about the clam chowder. They are SO RIGHT!  I'm not a clam chowder monger, but this one I loved. Fresh, not scalding hot, and the flavor was delish! I had the tuna melt which was huge. Mom had the seafood pasta and liked it. She's very picky eating out. A DIY lady that will complain about restauants if she feels like she could have done it herself at home. But this time she enjoyed the food and atmosphere. It was a great start to our mother's day.

Right along the water and casual all the way... perfect for those who want an easy meal without walking up to State street, in order to return to the water for more ocean kayaking!!!Can't say that anything was outstanding, but memorable and a good experience.",3 star rating,Jana C.
9/3/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Great local place serving up fresh seafood.The place gets super crowded and you can wait up to an hour for a table, but I'll let you in on a secret: the bar is first come, first serve.  So scope out some people that are finishing up and snag their seats.  You can order from the entire menu at the bar and the bartenders are really cool.I had the Cioppino, which was hearty and deliciously fresh.  However, the Ritz crackers that come with it are tacky, so just use the complimentary bread instead.I see all these negative reviews and don't really know why. Maybe they had bad experiences, but mine certainly wasn't.Also, get the ranch dressing and just try it. It's quite amazing.",5 star rating,Ethan S.
10/9/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Beautiful view!  The bar opens up to the patio and it was a great place to visit on a Saturday afternoon.  My husband and I shared the clam chowder and hot combo.  The clam chowder had generous portions of chewy clam.  The chowder was thick and flavorful.  The hot combo consists of beer boiled shrimp, steamed clams, oysters rocks, steamed mussels, and baked clams. It was a great way to taste a little bit of everything!  All the seafood tasted fresh and was so sweet and delicious!  The steamed clams and shrimp came in flavorful broth.  Each table gets a basket of complimentary sourdough bread.  The broth sure came in handy with the bread!  I would definitely come here again if I come visit SB in the future.",4 star rating,Tiffany C.
2/16/2014,"San Luis Obispo, CA",ERMAHGHERD. Best sea food I've ever had. The salmon salad was delicious and they cooked the fish to perfection. The Fish & Chips were done authentically with vinegar for the fries! A must-have any time I am going through SB.,5 star rating,Sophie R.
2/11/2008,"Glendora, CA","The wait wasn't long for us, but we came around 9:30 or so.  So  maybe a late dinner or an extra early dinner might be best if you want to avoid long waits.  It's a seafood joint.  Don't expect anything extra.  Fries or pilaf with your meal. Soup (clam chowder) or salad.  That's it.  Coleslaw comes with everything.  Fish, fish and more fish. And lobster of course.  Not a lobster lover, and I seemed to finish a whole half and left a pretty bare shell. But, then again, lots of Alcohol may have helped the appetite. We sat on  nice deck with heater lamps so it was a nice view of the dock with all the boats. The bar is downstairs. We stopped by the next day for a quick drink as we walked along the breaker.  You get bread, and can order soup and oysters.  The staff was friendly and it was pretty packed.  Inside you will get no view.  The seat we managed to get was at a bar facing a wall. lol. But at least they  had a mural of the map of the channel islands and coast of SB.  So i got an up-close lesson on this and decided I want to see the Channel islands sometime. There are a few tables outside so you can get a view, but good luck getting those.  Despite the lack of view, this place is poppin' with peeps getting cocktails and clam chowder and bread. And thank you Mr. Bartender who gave me complimentary fries to absorb the alcohol when he thought maybe I had a tad more to drink than I should have. I don't know what made him think that.  It couldn't have been me stealing a kid's perrier w/lime when I was so SURE it was a vodka tonic with  my name written all over it. And thank you Mr. Bartender for letting me keep the perrier w/lime and letting me believe it WAS a vodka tonic. Extra star just for you.A nice simple unpretentious place.",4 star rating,Donna S.
7/4/2010,"Rowland Heights, CA","We did a quick stop for snacks here before dinner. Turned out to be more of an early dinner because the portions were larger than expected. The downstairs is pretty chill and informal. It feels a bit like a dive bar because everyone knows everyone. Fried Calamari - where are my tentacles? They only serve the rings. Lightly battered. Average calamari. The cocktail sauce is pretty good though.French Fries - For $3 we got a lot of french fries. Ask for the house dressing. It's pretty yummy. There isn't much in terms of selection for food downstairs. It's really more of a place to grab a beer. If you want real food, head upstairs.",3 star rating,Minda w.
5/1/2012,"San Jose, CA","We were hanging out and wanted a quick snack and swung by this place. The clam chowder is good and hearty and full of clams. The cold sampler or something was fine. Shucked oysters and clams was delicious. The crab and cerviche though were a bit harder to deal with since it was on a bed of lettuce. it would fall in between the leaves a nuisance. Overall, good food worth a visit if you're in the area.",4 star rating,John T.
5/20/2013,"Riverside, CA","Very good food, but equally long wait. Arrived at 6:40 and seated at 8:15. Great place for hang-out-at the bar drink and eat crowd. But we were table-4-2 and wait was really long. Clam chowder was ok, but not in my top ten.",3 star rating,Dennis D.

1/17/2013,"Beaufort, SC",We love Brophy Brothers!  We were in town for only two nights and walked there from where we were staying (Marina Beach Motel).  It was so enjoyable sitting upstairs and outside under the heaters.   (Cold freeze followed us to town).  We liked it so much we ate dinner there both evenings.  First night = clam chowder with fish and chips.  Second night = ahi tuna and grilled salmon.  Both nights = excellent Bloody Mary's.,5 star rating,Karen B.
10/5/2015,"Huntington Beach, CA","We have had oysters and calamari in many places, but Brophy' s is far and away the best !!! The freshness and true authenticity in their approach to east coast preparation was an amazing experience ! We loved the calamari, light coating and not chewy, the steamers in a pot of broth with crusty bread to dip, and oysters on the half shell  That broth was to die for !!! Great Bloody Mary's to go with this amazing meal and wonderful service from Scotty make us want to move to SB . We will be back as soon as possible !",5 star rating,Renee P.
9/8/2012,"Las Cruces, NM","We arrived in Santa Barbara earlier than expected on the Tuesday after Labor Day. Since our hotel room was not yet ready, we asked the desk clerk for a lunch recommendation and he suggested Brophy Bros., which was within walking distance from the hotel. We got there just after 12:30, and the early lunch crowd was staring to leave. The hostess told us there would be a short wait for an outside table, or she could seat us inside immediately. We chose inside. Within a minute, the waitress was at our table with bread and asking if we would like water, and/or to order a drink. As we perused the menu, I glanced about the restaurant, and it appeared that many locals ate there. It seemed that most people knew someone else, and many were flirting with the waitresses. It turned out that our waitress, who certainly looked quite young, was efficient and well trained. She was knowledgeable about the menu, and was happy to make recommendations. My wife chose a grilled salmon salad, and I opted for the clam chowder and salad combo. The food came in a relatively short time, not so short that the salmon was cooked in advance. It was delicious. My wife's grilled salmon salad, contained a freshly and expertly grilled salmon filet that would be considered entree size at many restaurants. My chowder, which is the thick New England style, was excellent, with plenty of good sized chunks of clam in a thick creamy sauce with potatoes that were not over-cooked. The salad was not over dressed.As mentioned, the waitress was efficient and friendly. She waited an appropriate amount of time to come by and inquire about our satisfaction with the food. In too many restaurants, the waitperson appears to ask if everything is OK, before I have even had a chance to taste the food. Later, I picked up the wine list to look at the wine selection, and she appeared shortly to ask if I had decided to order or if I was just looking. She also offered a bread refill. My wife and I were so pleased with our experience, that we returned a couple of nights later, with our daughter and her husband to have dinner. On our second visit, there was a short wait. We took our beeper, and waited in the downstairs bar. It took only 15 minutes, before we were seated at an outdoor table. Once again we had a great waitperson. Our waiter was friendly, informative and not overly solicitous.   Water and bread appeared quickly. This time I ordered the salmon (dinner, not salad), my wife had the chowder/salad, my daughter ordered the Mahi-mahi, and I can't remember what my son-in-law ordered. I do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. So, two visits in three days, and two very enjoyable experiences. Needless to say, I highly recommend this restaurant. Oh, and the prices are quite reasonable.One quibble, though... no desserts! It would have been nice to have had something sweet to end the evening.",4 star rating,Larry C.

7/16/2012,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",Best bread in Santa Barbara. Fantastic atmosphere and with the downstairs bar addition you have something to do while you wait. The only thing I wish is that they had a vegetarian option other than the house salad. I go there for my b/f and the view and end up gorging on bread to fill up.,4 star rating,Tiffany G.
3/22/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","I have gone twice in the the past month. The last visit I had to ask everyone I saw at the bar to bring me some water. Today I ordered everything at once, food, water, and wine.Since there was just me, I sat at the bar.  NO ONE asked me how anything was...not the food,which was great, not the wine, did I need more water...nothing. The next time I come, I will take a table, as the bartenders do not seem to be interested in service.",2 star rating,Beth B.
12/9/2015,"Des Moines, IA","Food and Service were both amazing.  I wish I knew our server's name so I could rave about his impeccable service.  So helpful and always around when we needed him, but never intrusive.  He would appear out of nowhere when we needed help, drop off food, drinks, etc. and then disappear again.",5 star rating,Ian H.
