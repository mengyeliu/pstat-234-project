5/25/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Everytime I'm in Solvang I want to try this place but they always seem to be very busy, before Covid and during. Come here on a weekend, you may have to wait awhile for a table. Finally took a chance on a weekday and found this place to be true to all the great reviews. Service and food wereequally amazing!!I had the Paula's Special, Danish pancakes with fresh strawberries and whipping cream... highly recommend!! Hubby had the pancakes, ham and eggs. He enjoyed his breakfast. They added a small slice of apple and orange, nice touch!! If your here on a weekend and willing to wait, it's worth it!!",5 star rating,Mary F.
4/14/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","While staying in Solvang we looked up breakfast places in the area. Paula's Pancake House immediately jumped out at us so we decided to give it a shot. We liked it so much we went back the next morning! Parking is relatively easy with plenty of street parking and free parking lots nearby. They offer indoor and patio seating along with take-out. Both mornings we went, we beat the rush by going early and decided to enjoy the patio area.My better half had the Danish Pancake Combination - 2 huge pancakes topped with whipped cream and strawberries served with eggs and bacon or sausage. I had the Danish Omelette the first morning and 2 French Toast with a side of ham the second time. All of the food we tried was delicious! The pancakes are ridiculously filling and tasty, the sausage is great and the eggs/omelette are perfect. Food came out fast and piping hot.Service was friendly and attentive. When we left both times, there was quite the line forming outside so going earlier is better if you want to avoid the crowds. It's been a while since we've eaten out at a restaurant due to COVID-19 but we felt completely safe. Next time we're in Solvang, we're definitely going back to Paula's Pancake House!",5 star rating,Marcus C.
3/28/2021,"San Diego, CA","Dutch pancakes baby!!!!  Best of the best.  These were insanely good.  So good that I ordered the warm apples one for myself after finishing their delicious corned beef hash LOL.  The speciality sausage was delicious with the pancakes if you're not feeling fruity and sweet.  Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Service was super friendly and they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy the sun, people watch, and enjoy some delicious breakfast/brunch!  Prices are on-par with other breakfast establishments in SoCal ($10-$15).  Thanks Paula's, I'll be dreaming of these pancakes in which I can't eat everyday!  A must-try in Solvang.",5 star rating,Cathee C.
4/18/2021,"Buena Park, CA","I came here for Sunday brunch. I loved the location because it's right in the middle of the area. When we got there, of course there was a line since it was during Sunday brunch hours so we put our name down and waited.  After 20-30 mins, we got seated at our table. I ordered the danish pancake combo, which are danish pancakes, sausage which I substituted for a Danish sausage, and eggs. I also ordered a side of hash browns well done. My bf ordered the chicken country fried steak. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. I would have given this 5 stars only if the chicken country fried steak was a tad bit bigger. The portion was kind of small. Everything else was so good!",4 star rating,Jeannie K.
4/18/2021,"Pasadena, CA","Paula's was one of the few places I saw a Danish breakfast-other-than-pastries offered in Solvang, so of course I made my roommate eat here with me on our last morning of vacation. I was in a mimosa mood so I ordered one, and I ordered the Danish pancake combo with a Danish sausage because I *am* that person and wanted to get as Danish as possible for breakfast. I chose cinnamon apples to add to my pancakes.I've had Swedish pancakes at a few diners, and these Danish pancakes were reminiscent of that. The pancake and sausage weren't strikingly different from your typical American breakfast, so even those with the taste palate of a four-year-old (as well as four-year-olds) should be able to enjoy it. I also thought the eggs were cooked alright and the apples were yummy. The mimosa was average but not appropriate for four year olds.I wasn't a fan of our table location, which was right next to flower bushes, and you guessed it, bees. Can't really enjoy a sugary Danish vacation during a pandemic without the constant drone of bzzzzzzzzz and your fight or flight kicking in during every meal. So what'll it be? Your food or your dignity? Also the service here was fine. No complaints.",4 star rating,Colby D.
4/3/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Danish pancakes are pretty darn tasty. They're light and fluffy and as wide as they are, I feel like I can eat stacks on stacks of them. Had to try a Danish sausage while I was at it too, and they were okay. Basic, mild, tasty. We dined in and it was hot inside. Air needed to be on. Staff/service was okay. It was a Saturday and it was bussssssyyyy, so I totally get why the staff seemed super stressed out. Overall, it was worth the 45 minute wait. Just strollup/down the street and check out the other shops.",4 star rating,Genie L.
4/1/2021,"Irvine, CA","A typical, touristy Solvang Danish breakfast spot. Really crowded, but the hosts do a great job seating and getting people in and out quickly.The breakfast came out super fast. A little surprisingly too fast for how busy the place was. The sausage was lukewarm and pancakes were the same. But no big deal. Who doesn't like lukewarm sausages hahaThe breakfast was just ok. The Danish sausage was super subtle in taste. The Danish pancake was soft, thin pancake that was Danish haha Nothing that tickled my tastebuds or OMG 5 star, but just alright breakfast items. If you're looking for a typical, really decent serving size breakfast then this is the spot. If you're looking for special flavors, then this isn't your spot.",3 star rating,Jenn C.
5/28/2021,"Santa Cruz, CA","Breakfast was SUBLIME! Starting with our friendly, knowledgeable, efficient server, Tamara! I was barely able to snap a picture  before my husband DOVE in. The Danish pancake was light, airy and as a Vermonter  maple syrup was ABSOLUTELY not missed! Don't be fooled by a line. The restaurant seating is fast and efficient and yet, once seated, we didn't feel rushed AT ALL!",5 star rating,Lois R.
3/4/2021,"Irvine, CA","Always a solid breakfast stop for us whenever we are headed up north for a road trip! We always order:Paula's special danish pancakes with fresh strawberries - 2 thin large plate-size pancakes with fresh strawberries and syrup. Always so fresh and delicious! We always finish our plates!Scrambled eggs - fresh and lightly whipped.Hash brown - wow, it's so crispy and perfect!Coffee - standard coffee hereHot tea - I love that they give you your own little pot of hot water to refill your tea.Patio seating due to covid but they turned on the heaters which was nice. Overall, one of our favorite breakfast spots in the area. Come early to find parking and avoid a long wait!",4 star rating,Sara K.
4/12/2021,"Alhambra, CA",Delicious!! I had the danish omelette with has browns and a fresh baked biscuit and it was all perfect! The omelette comes with havarti cheese and danish sausage. My boyfriend got the danish pancakes with scrambled eggs and and bacon. The danish pancakes are large and thin like crepes and they had home made whipped cream and it was SO good! We ate every bite. Would come back for breakfast againServer was friendly and polite and came back to check on us promptly and asked if we needed any refills.,5 star rating,Candace P.
1/8/2021,"Berkeley, CA","Quick service & friendly staff! When doing research on places to eat in Solvang, this was a highly recommended spot from travel blogs/websites, so naturally we had to check it out! Solvang Danish Sausage & Eggs: Comes with hash browns & your side of toast! It's a solid go-to if you want that traditional breakfast fill up, though for the amount of food you get, $11 is a but pricey. The sausage was good though, and the flavor reminded me of pate!Danish Pancakes with Strawberries: This is what you come here for (it's boxed on their menu to highlight that it's a specialty as well!) It comes with syrup, butter, and a type of crema that works so well together! (Fun fact: the container of crema was heavier than the container of strawberries, something I wasn't expecting) The pancakes themselves are thinner than a traditional American pancake, but a bit thicker than a crepe. Overall: Pricey for certain items, but a great place to try Danish breakfast foods!",4 star rating,Michelle H.
4/4/2021,"Milpitas, CA","Let me just start out by saying this is by far some of the fluffiest breakfast items I've ever experienced! My party ordered the danish pancake combo that came with two pancakes, choice of bacon or sausage, and two eggs and the belgian waffle with fresh fruit. The thin consistency of the pancake make it feel super light and not heavy. Paired with some maple syrup and fruit and you got a perfect combo of flavors going on. I also really enjoyed their bacon! It's not your average bacon and has a nice smokiness/crisp to it without being oily. As for the belgian waffle, it was crispy to cut but then every bite was so fluffy! Also super enjoyable with the maple syrup and fresh fruit!I came around noon on a Thursday and there was an approximate 30 minute wait. Honestly wasn't bad because that gave me some time to stroll around Solvang. Not sure if it's the idea of being in Solvang itself or the environment architecture, or the fact that the staff were dressed in Danish clothes, but the place had a certain charm to it and absolutely loved my experience. Do yourself a favor and check out Paula's. You won't regret it!",5 star rating,Denise P.

3/20/2021,"Bakersfield, CA","Great breakfast. Our first experience with danish pancakes vs buttermilk pancakes, and we had danish sausage and danish omelette. The danish sausage is pretty clean tasting. Our server is always checking, making sure we're ok. It was a cold morning.",5 star rating,Johann L.
12/28/2020,"San Diego, CA",Super popular breakfast and lunch spot in Solvang. I love diner style sandwiches and dishes and my trusty Yelp had so many good reviews for Paula's so I was excited to try it. We visited in January of 2020 and it was super packed. We actually got seated pretty quickly out On The patio. I had the pastrami sandwich on a grilled French roll with no cheese. It was so good and really hit the spot. Great fuel for a day of exploring the town and thinking wine. My BF got the patty melt and he said it was delicious. The fries were addicting. Not too thick and retained their crispness.,4 star rating,Kris G.
3/7/2021,"Palmdale, CA","The food was sooooo good. I had never tried a danish pancake before and I enjoyed it. A Mimosa for the table is 25 dollars, which includes a large bottle of champagne and OJ. The staff seemed super busy which was understandable because the place was packed. We had to wait an hour for a table. But since it was so busy our waitress never asked if we wanted refills in our drinks. We had to ask the neighboring waiter to help us out.",5 star rating,Shanette M.
3/27/2021,"Loma Linda, CA","First time in Solvang and already everyone told me to stop at this place for breakfast.  It's a very good breakfast joint that's very popular that specialize in Danish pancakes. Well let me start with saying I've never had Danish pancakes so I'm no expert but they were very good.  We also got French toast that had a nice crunch on the outside, waffles, corned beef hash (likely from a can), and a Danish omelet which consisted of Danish sausage and Harvati cheese.  They also served homemade biscuits that were good, refreshing mimosas, hot coffee, and good service to top it off. Would definitely eat here if in Solvang.",5 star rating,Krystal D.
5/12/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","One of the most popular spots in Solvang, make sure you give yourself time because the wait can be long. The danish pancakes are delicious, the smoked salmon was a little salty for my taste but still great! The staff is great as well! Oh and DEF grab one of their danish sausages!!!",4 star rating,Kevin L.
12/2/2020,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA","A must during your visit to Solvang, at least just once. Join the waitlist about an hour before you'd like to eat. It's hard to mind the wait when there is so much to do in the area. It's the busiest of breakfast restaurants on the street, lots of commotion. They occupied the entire sidewalk space which makes lots of room for distanced tables. They seemed to be accommodating for children and handicap accessible. There's really only one thing on the item to review here and that's the Dutch pancake. I went all the way with strawberries and cream and it was worth it. The apples and blueberries are also delicious. The combo plate is a great deal!",4 star rating,Lauren A.
5/4/2021,"San Antonio, TX","There's lots of ""partially"" shaded outdoor seating here. I say partially, because you're good on shade if you have a party or 3 or less, but if you have more, someone will be eating in the sun.   The indoor seating is nice and the air conditioning works great. The restaurant also seemed very clean. I found the service to be slightly below average. We weren't offered refills on our water on a warm day and the waitress forgot to ask me what side I wanted and skipped me after I said bacon cheeseburger. I told her what I wanted after everyone else finished ordering. The burger I ordered was solid. What really irked me is that I don't believe the potato salad is made in house. It tasted like the cheap potato salad you buy at Walmart. That was VERY disappointing. The saving grace for this place is that four of the people in my party had some form on pancake plate and they all loved their food. Their plates looked very good, especially the pancakes. My wife had eggs benedict and she liked it. The prices on the food were ok for California prices. I would come back and eat here again if invited to.",4 star rating,D Rafa P.

From the hostess to the servers, everyone was friendly and spot on. I had the Danish Pancakes with cinnamon apples and a danish sausage, both were 10/10.

12/2/2020,"San Francisco, CA","Super fast breakfast/lunch spot. The danish pancakes are crepe-like, and are good (but I personally couldn't finish - it was heavy with the sugar soaked strawberries, whipping cream and syrup. The danish sausage was also quite good, disappointed it only came with one. Worth the novelty and its right next door to Olsens Bakery. When in Solvang!",4 star rating,Suelin K.
12/1/2020,"San Jose, CA","Paula's food is perfectly yummy, and they're definitely worth a try if you stop by Solvang. My suggestion, though, would be to avoid busier times during COVID. social distancing is not well observed, and many guests stand in the waiting area without masks (since you're waiting on the street/sidewalk, the restaurant doesn't really oversee this area). And the seating area is also a little too close for comfort. The food is type tourist trap stuff: a kitschy special and big portions. Both my partner and I opted for the full tourist experience, and we both ordered the Paula's special, Danish pancakes with fruit and whipped cream. They were certainly good, a lot like crepes. My partner and I were also surprised to find that the blueberry fruit topping was better than the apple. We were glad to have ordered both!Service was fine. Food came out super fast: while we waited 45 minutes for a table, we probably only actually sat at that table for 20 minutes or so. Try to visit during less busy times! That's my only real suggestion.",4 star rating,Sara W.
11/2/2020,"West Covina, CA","Pretty cute spot for brunch!Went to visit Solvang with my family and Yelp told us to go here for brunch & it didn't steer us wrong. There's actually plenty of free public parking around here, you just have to follow the signs.We opted for outside seating because it was quick - however they were having a bee problem and there were honestly so many bees. We didn't mind it at first but I'll be honest now and say that it was a bit hectic.I got the corned beef benedict, my mom got the chicken steak plate, my brother got steak and eggs and my boyfriend got a Danish pancake with fruits. Everything came out pretty quick and was delicious! Definitely recommend.",4 star rating,Tiffany N.
2/14/2021,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",We wanted to try Paul's Saturday morning but the wait was very long and the kids wouldn't haven't been able to wait that long. So we decided Sunday morning before we leave the hotel we will order it to go and have it in our room. I couldn't leave with out trying there Danish pancakes and I'm glad I did because  I enjoyed it very much. It was thin and very light. It had a unique taste as well  because I got a hit of orange which was nice. Glad I didn't leave solvang with out trying it. Looking forward to trying other things on the item next time I visit Solvang again.,4 star rating,Anna S.
2/18/2021,"Los Angeles, CA",My husband and I love coming to Paula's Pancake house when we're in town! I'm surprisingly not a fan of their danish pancakes but love their buttermilk pancakes and waffles. The Irish Benedict is amazing!

8/23/2020,"Irvine, CA","*COVID-19 Experience*We came here today due to last minute recommendation from my coworker. I had to order the Danish Pancake topped with blueberries. I Expected a lot but it was really just okay. Portion is huge that you can share it with 1 or two other people. My Bf describes it well, it's just a thick version of a crepe  but thinner than a pancake. BF Got the  Chicken Fried Steak with egg and country gravy. It was soo good!! Small portion than what I'm used to, but there's something About their batter and/or gravy that makes it so yummy! This place is busy!! Put your name down and line up next door at olsen's danish for some yummy pastries! With the busyness service was still on point!!",4 star rating,Keycee D.
10/26/2020,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA","Reviewing during COVID (Oct 2020)Offers outdoor dining with plenty of tables. There is a very long wait (over an hour) for a party of 5 at 11am on a Saturday which was understandable. We came for the Danish style pancakes. We ordered the Danish Pancake combo with eggs & sausage, one with just whip and the other with cinnamon apples. We also shares the steak & eggs with hash browns. Overall the breakfast was good but not exceptional, definitely not worth driving from LA county if that is your only target. Great customer service, no wait from the time they sit you, to ordering food, getting your food and checking on you after you receive your food. The outdoor dining is great but nature, BEES, gets in the way as they fly around you and lands at everything on your table. It was an experience, the pancakes tasted like regular pancakes, just thinner than a buttermilk pancake.",3 star rating,Dee-Ana P.
8/16/2020,"Anaheim, CA","Controversially I ordered a green chili omelette and no pancakes but I did take a lil bite from Robin's plate. As you can see the portions are giant. The waitstaff did a wonderful job checking on us and we felt very comfortable with their cleanliness and social distancing, score! The actual food was delicious. The biscuit that came with my omelette was so fluffy and paired with the jams? Outta this world. Eggs were perfect. You know sometimes you get an omelette and the texture of the eggs is closer to sponge? Not here. Like an omelette cloud. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice to wash down your plate. Overall a great breakfast place.",5 star rating,Mckenna D.
9/13/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","While visiting Solvang and the ostriches I had to stop by Paula's Pancake House. When I drove by around 8:30am there was a bunch of people already waiting outside for outdoor sitting during Covid19, but when I called to order for pick up, they said it would only take about 10 min. and they were pretty accurate. I ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict ""Florentine"" and the Paula's Special, Danish Pancakes of course! I found the Florentine eggs benedict delicious! The Hollandaise sauce was great! Paula's special (danish pancakes) were okay to be honest.I would be back for breakfast because the staff are very friendly and wonderful!",4 star rating,Richie D.
10/9/2020,"Long Beach, CA","COVID19 Breakfast ReviewWe were in town with friends for a weekend of wine tasting. They suggested we visit Paula's Pancake House for breakfast. As there are not many breakfast places in town, we had a long wait to be seated. We waited for a little over 30 minutes. The staging area is not well defined but it's Solvang and it's a darling town. The servers are dressed in Danish attire and were all very sweet. The table ordered:Coffee - nothing special but nice to have with breakfast.Danish Pancake Combo which included two eggs, a sausage and Danish pancakes (crepe style) topped with butter and powdered sugar. The pancakes themselves are very sweet. Danish Omelet which included Danish sausage and Havarti cheese, a side of fruit and sourdough toast with strawberry jelly. The omelet was tasty, but I did need to ask my cheese to be melted.Short Stack of Buttermilk pancakes topped with butter and a side of maple syrup. Very good pancakes.Overall, it's what you would expect from a breakfast hot spot in a tourist town. I would return the next time I am in town. The experience was fun. The servers wore proper PPE. The restrooms were clean, the coffee cup never went dry and the pancakes were a sweet treat.",4 star rating,Kelly R.
8/13/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I am not sure if it was worth the 1hr 30 min wait, but there was nothing I disliked about it so I'll give it 5 stars. I don't know if it's worth the 2+hr drive from LA just for pancakes, but it's definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area as this place is one of the tourist hot spots. #doitforthegramThe food came out quickly, which was great because we had to wait for so long. I got the danish pancakes with strawberries/cream. My friends and I enjoyed our pancakes but it wasn't anything to die for. I can probably find something similar in LA. There was outdoor seating due to Covid, but I don't think the social distancing aspect was enough as I had someone sitting RIGHT behind me.",5 star rating,Sarah M.
3/24/2021,"Phoenix, AZ","We really enjoyed our breakfast at Paula's Pancake House.  Even though restaurants are currently at a 25% capacity the staff is so pleasant and always there even if it is not their table.  I tried their classic eggs Benedict with sliced tomatoes and hash browns while my husband tried their Danish omelet with a side of sliced tomatoes and a homemade biscuit.  My husband thought the biscuit was a bit dry, but I liked it.  Masks yes, social distancing yes, no gloves on servers if that is something you need",5 star rating,Nanci G.
8/9/2020,"Downey, CA","Covid 2020 means social distancing and long wait times. Fortunately enough for my friend and I, parties of 2 persons had about a 30 min to 45 min wait time reduction. Granted there were parties of 8 which is mind blowing.I door seating closed off to non mask wearers and for dine in purposes. Thankfully the bathrooms were still available.My friend and I decided to try their most popular Dutch pancakes. But why stop there? We also ordered the Irish eggs benedict, and steak and eggs. We were so glad that their portion sizes were not too American. The steak was a good 3oz in size, and about half a cup of hash potatoes. Just enough for us to finish 90% of everything and not feel stuffed.The Dutch pancakes are a must try. They were very light and fluffy. We are not big fans of anything too sweet but thankfully the syrup was also very light. Would definitely recommend this place to others!",4 star rating,Vivian Y.

By the time we ordered their famous crepe pancakes, it didn't take long before it was served to us. Don't be fooled by the portions. You might think you can eat it all but you really can't.. at least for me!

Wish we had arrived early since we were across the street but never the less it was a great breakfast!First off portions are huge.. wish we would have shared the pancake. Now I know why they are so well known.. Paulas pancakes are a crepe like powdered sugar fluffiness of yumminess .. highly recommend!Only recommendation is have a better designated waiting area because it's so cramped and hard to enjoy your food if you are seated on the outsides toward the sidewalk. It's difficult with Covid but hopefully some organization or signs of where the lines start would be helpful",5 star rating,Dee G.
7/16/2020,"Riverside, CA","Excellent service and awesome food. This was a great choice. We ate like little pigs .  We weren't sure where to eat today while visiting Solvang since everything is good here. We will definitely come back here next time. We ordered Buttermilk Pancakes with strawberries combination with scrambled eggs. Danish Pancakes with sausage & the Italian omelette. Can't go wrong with any of them, if you had to make a decision. They have outdoor seating and lots of Corona Virus safety's in place. I think they have limited hours, however super happy they are open and surviving all the craziness going on.",5 star rating,Tushar M.

Coincidentally, we happened to arrive on the first day (7/1/202) they opened back up for business for dine-in since the pandemic closure. Perfect! It was outdoor seating only, per Governor's orders. Servers also wore masks. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. I got the Danish pancakes with whipped cream and fruit. Their whipped cream was so good because it's fresh and not the fake canned stuff other places use. Paula's is always a must when in Solvang!",5 star rating,Selena M.
8/22/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I usually skip out on breakfast but my friends who had been to the area before said that it was worth checking out. Sunday morning it seemed pretty busy, even compared to some of the other places we walked by so I figured it's good even amongst the other places.We came at a good time because we got seated pretty quickly and the wait grew longer after that. Dutch Pancake house, so I got the Dutch Pancake combo with eggs and the Danish sausage. The pancake was decent, lighter than your usual but bigger, other than that, it was just a pancake. The eggs were standard diner style, fried hot and fast and the sauage, I'm not sure what made it any more Danish other than assigning it that title.Service was good and friendly, there were a few servers that came by, as it got busier there was that no rush, but here's your check play that can happen. Overall, it was a good diner type breakfast with a nice hook but still just a diner.",3 star rating,Ted C.

12/26/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I know my review won't make much of a difference in one's choice to eat here, as this place has created quite a popular following. But unfortunately, my experience here was less than satisfactory, not necessarily because of the food, but because of the service. We received a take-out order and several items were missing. As we attempted to rectify it, it seemed that the young lady taking our order did not write down everything we had requested. I can't say that I'm surprised because unfortunately, She seemed incredibly confused the entire time we spoke. We didn't order anything complicated, just items straight off the menu but she was still having a hard time understanding us. Long story short, we got one item totally wrong, one drink wrong, and were missing a total of 4 things from our order. Because they were only offering pick up, we realized the missing items immediately and they showed us the original receipt stating it wasn't charged so we had to pay again. However, the incorrect item was noticed a few minutes later as we walked down the street to find a spot to sit. So when we came to show them that, they whipped out the receipt again to show them that's what we were charged and that what we wanted had an up charge. I was pretty upset at that point cuz we've spent an extra thirty minutes of our precious two hour stay there just undoing their mistakes. I told them as much and how frustrated I was so she then decided not to charge us the additional amount. Lastly, the food tastes like something you'd get in a small town diner, and not in a good way. Watered down eggs, underdone hashbrowns, and tasteless pancakes. Next time, I'll just stick with the danishes.",3 star rating,Ziba H.

3/30/2021,"Garden Grove, CA","We love brunch so we decided to stop by Paula's. We were seated outdoors on a nice summer morning. We started off with the mimosa special. Since we were planning on trying other snacks in Solvang, we decided to share Paula's Special Dutch Pancakes with fresh strawberries and a side of Danish-style sausages. The pancakes were good and paired well with strawberries and whipped cream. The sausages were not memorable. Our waitress was nice and was always checking up on us. If we had to choose, we would try the Dutch pancakes over aebleskivers while in Solvang.",5 star rating,Annie N.
4/30/2020,"Monterey Park, CA","This is a really cute little breakfast place with reasonable priced food on the menu! From what I heard, this is the most popular breakfast dining place of Solvang! And from visiting here once I can tell you why! The food are made extremely fast and the service is amazing! There are enough things on the menu for you to find something you like, but highly recommend you to try the Danish pancakes if you do go here -- since they're known for that in particular. I normally don't enjoy pancake, and I have to say they made some quite enjoyable pancakes.Customer service here is great, they would come and check on you every so often to make sure your experience is just as great as they hope it to be. They have 2 cute unisex bathrooms that is to Solvang theme, however it is a little small -- so be prepared when you enter!I came here on a weekend and lucky for me since we came an hour before closing there was barely little to no line. But!! They get super crowded during holidays and weekends, so expect some wait time! They have cute indoor seating as well as nice atmosphere for outdoor seating.  I honestly would've chose outside seating if it weren't so cold!Finding parking may be a challenge even on weekdays, street parking is the only way around. However even with street parking you need to come early in the day to get a spot, or else expect to park further unless you are willing to pay for parking as this whole town is known as a travelers' place.",5 star rating,Jenny C.

Just last weekend they had outside seating that was way too close to each other and waiting of guests that were just as close. Not good to see. And the time we ate prior to this, well this is a popular spot, bu I have to be honest, there are better. Don't mean to knock a restaurant, but just didn't do it for us",3 star rating,Rox C.

We originally were seated outside and just could not keep them away, we asked to move inside since they were open for dine in and there were a lot of flies indoors as well. I understand that flies are hard to control but there wasn't even anything being done to at least try to minimize the problem. They could get a magnetic screen door if they have to keep the door open or use natural essential oils. It is hard to have an appetite when flies are landing on your plate.",3 star rating,Bonnie S.

Hubby ordered the California Special & I got the Eggs Benedict w/ Salmon, we both shared the famous pancakes. Overall, average. The coffee was good & piping hot. His OJ looked like it came from a plastic container. The food tasted good but nothing really spectacular. I am impressed though that they're operating at all and I wanted to support the business. Dining al fresco the way they can, not bad. Service was good, professional but lacking in a bit of spirit/character. We would still patronize the place even if I rated it a 3  -still a good place dine in Solvang.",3 star rating,Jennifer W.

11/30/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Popular spot for good breakfast and good service. Portion sizes are great and plenty of outdoor seating, but maybe too popular for me during a pandemic. Seating was not very spaced out and it seemed like all the precautions between tables are not taken as with some other restaurants.My wife and I shared the French toast and Spanish omelet. Both were delicious and filling. I also got a hot chocolate which was perfect on a cold morning. Prices are reasonable and I left satisfied. Nothing too memorable about any of the dishes but I guess we didn't get the Danish pancakes that they are known for. Other family members got them but didn't look like anything special. Probably would try another breakfast spot next time I'm in Solvang but if you are interested I wouldn't tell you not to try it. Hope you enjoy!",3 star rating,Michael B.

I'm not a big fan of eating outside, especially in the parking lot under a tent but it's not the restaurant's fault.I ordered the danish pancakes and added strawberries. It comes with sausage on the side, I wasn't crazy about it.The pancakes though, they're worthy of a review on their own. They're a hybrid between a pancake and a crepe, pancrepe. They're light and airy and so delicious. The breakfast also came with hash browns and eggs, that was good but I just wanted to keep eating pancakes.I also got a large OJ and a latte. The latte comes with a cookie on the side and it's so good. I will definitely be back after this whole craziness is over so I can enjoy eating inside.",5 star rating,Evelyn V.

3/4/2020,"Lompoc, CA","Paula's Pancake House is the most popular breakfast diner in Solvang. They are always crowded and busy especially on weekends, so be prepared to wait. The atmosphere is quaint and homey with indoor and outdoor seating. They have a very broad menu, but their specialty is the Danish pancakes. The customer service overall is okay. Paula's Special:Decent portion. The Danish pancakes were really good. They were thin and fluffy. I got mine with strawberries, and they were fresh and sweet. I really loved their syrup! It's sweet, but not overly sweet, and the consistency is very thin compared to other syrups.Danish Pancakes Combination:Again, super yummy pancakes! The scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and tasted good. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the Danish style sausage. All in all, I'd come back for the pancakes, and I recommend giving this breakfast joint a try if you do not mind waiting.",4 star rating,Cindy B.

I thought it was worth the 15-20 minute wait for my group of 6.

I loved that the ham was thicker than normal, and the flavor was just amazing. It was a huge surprise since I didn't expect too much. I would go back just for this.Italian omelette: Very good and flavorful! Different than your typical omelette toppings!Danish Pancakes: We ordered these because it was a specialty item. It was very good! Thinner than a typical pancake but thicker than a crepe.

Typical diner food with a Danish twist...but everything was just made so well!  The thick cut bacon was crispy and chewy at the same time, the eggs were cooked perfectly (running yolks but cooked whites), hashbrowns were crispy but soft..just all around deliciousness.One small negative - I did take a bite of my friends waffle and it was a bit on the soft side. I like my waffles super crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside so it could have probably used another 45 seconds in the iron.",4 star rating,Lisa C.

I had pretty high expectectations, it was lunch time so I didnt want to get the pancakes so I got a hash brown , eggs , and sasuage etc. I know its also a breakfest meal  but anyways the hash brown is okay and the eggs just something you can make home. The Sasuage is totally different it was actually real sasuage , juicy and thick also crunchy lol. The biscuit i think they can do better one biscuit wasnt enough for me theyre kinda small and I thought itll be sweet or some type of taste. Anyways the BIGGEST plate theyre known for is their pancakes! The pancakes is WAY beter than Denny and Ihop pancakes. The batter is actually sweet and buttery.

We put our name on a list and they told us it would be a half an hour to 45 minutes. We set a timer on her phone and walked around and went shopping for about 20 minutes. We came back and they  called our name within a half an hour. The food was delicious. I got a corn beef and hash Eggs Be and my husband got the Italian omelette. Of course we had to try the pancakes so we shared the pancake special with cinnamon apples on top. So happy we did it was delicious,5 star rating,Donna M.

Wife left her sunglasses here and as we were heading back home to So Cal she realized. We knew we were coming in December so we decided to see if they had the sunglasses when we came back. When we asked the manager went to go check, we described how the glasses look and to our surprise they had them still. That's the kind of town this is.

2/21/2021,"Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA","We arrived here on Monday morning at the President's day. Although the staff told us it's around 1 hour and 20 minutes to wait for outdoor seating, the actual waiting time might only take less than 40 minutes. I'll say it's worth waiting for trying the Danish Pancakes and the Danish-Style Sausage if you've never been here before. In addition, I highly recommended the Danish Omelettes with Danish Sausage inside and  covered by Havarti Cheese. Not too salty but tasty!連假最後一天的早上，餐廳外面已經排滿了人，雖然服務人員告訴我們可能要等1小時20分鐘，但實際等候時間大概不到40分鐘。我覺得從來沒吃過的真的可以排一次吃看看，丹麥鬆餅跟丹麥香腸蠻不錯的，香腸不會太鹹。我最推薦的是丹麥Omelette（裡面有切塊的丹麥香腸），上面會鋪上Havarti 起士，很好吃",4 star rating,Reallyn C.

You walk in and it feels like a house and an old school diner all rolled into one. We sat a table to the side where the chairs look like you came to grandmas house. They had basic two egg with bacon breakfast which is what I ordered. Everything was very good and the service was terrific.

11/13/2020,"Santa Clarita, CA","A coworker recommended this place so we could not pass it up when we were in the area. We were warned about the long wait, but it was definitely worth it.  My friend and I both got the ""Paula's Special"" (if it's named after the restaurant, it's worth a try!) I got mine with apples, and she got hers with strawberries.  I had never had Danish pancakes before, they were light and fluffy and delicious. The servers were really attentive and kept filling up our water and coffee (and very impressively kept remembering which one was decaf and which one was regular). There were bees, but that's not really the restaurant's fault. Reasons for deducting a star: because of the long wait and covid, they should implement a better system so that people are not gathered out in large groups waiting for their name to be called.  I have been to several restaurants that take your number and send a text when your table is ready.  This would allow people to disperse and do their own thing till it is time to return instead of gathering.  They need better boundaries for the bathroom during this time. There are two stalls and there is a table next to it and the bar where servers are walking in and out is RIGHT next to it.  There was no place to social distance-ly que.  I waited right outside the doors, and there was a gentleman behind me that did his best not to get too close, but there wasn't anywhere else for him to go without bumping into tables.  The servers had no choice but to walk RIGHT next to us, it was very uncomfortable. Five stars for food and services, three stars for the other things, but with some small adjustments this would easily be a five star rating.  I would love to try it again when I'm back in Solvang.",4 star rating,Nikki F.

Someone in our group said ""it reminded them of grandma's house."" Our server was nice. My only complaint is that we had to wait 20 minutes because the hostess sat a two top down at the last open five top right before us. I know this because I saw her try to seat them at a two top and they asked if they could move to the larger table. An efficient hostess would have told them that table was reserved for larger parties, but oh well.",4 star rating,Courtney L.
10/8/2019,"Lakewood, CA","A destination not forgotten from when we visited years ago. We skipped the morning rush and chose to visit a bakery and walk around Solvang before we arrived at Paula's with no wait. A nice outdoor patio is available. However,  to skip the heat and the craziness of bee season flying around us, we sat inside. Yes, all we wanted was the Danish Pancakes! The order comes with two large thin pancakes, topped with your choice of fresh Strawberries, Blueberries, or Apples. We added the Danish Sausage for some protein, which was lacking a bit in flavor. I had the urge to ask for mustard. We tried both the blueberry and apple as a topping. If you're looking for sweet, choose the apples. The maple syrup was quite interesting. Super thin/runny, which can be deceiving when pouring it on your pancakes. It can be very sweet. Our server was awesome and suggested we adjust our order to be more cost effective, which we appreciated. The place itself is a little outdated, but it goes along with the charm of Solvang. It's just like we remembered.",4 star rating,Yvette M.

9/13/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","We were on a vacation and it was our first time at this place. It's historic, old style breafast cafe in downtown Solvang. We didn't have to wait long because we came early morning, but soon as we left there was a large crowd gathered in front. Atmosphere has a homestyle vibe. Though small, they have lots of tables including patio and counter area. Breakfast and lunch options are plentiful and reasonably priced. Our server was friendly and prompt, she came by regularly to refill our coffee and water. As for our meal, we got corn beef and hash with eggs ($10.95), large stack of pancakes ($8.50) and danish combo which is crepe-style pancakes ($15.20). Everything looked good and portions were nice. The only thing that stood out and actually tasted the best was the Danish Pancakes! I wish that we had only ordered just those so we didn't have to fight over them. They were powdered, served with strawberries and fresh homemade whipped cream, so yummy! Bacon was a great match with the Danish pancakes...thick and crisp.Traditional pancakes were okay. Corn beef and hash was good, but not exceptional. All in all, we were please with our experience. The food was tasteful and the coffee was comforting.  Definitely worth checking out when you're in Solvang.",4 star rating,Leo C.
3/25/2021,"Lancaster, CA","Not sure if it's this week that this place is crowded and that impacted my food but this place is overhyped. I ordered pancakes with eggs and sausage. The sausage was the only good thing on this plate. The eggs were average while the pancakes were runny in the middle, for how flat these pancakes were not sure how that happened. Our other plate was French toast with a delicious danish sausage. The french toast tasted like egg and nothing more. You can try it for the experience but not worth it in my opinion.",2 star rating,Carlos G.

I got a side of Hash browns.My scrambled eggs were good, the hash browns were good and the sausage was excellent. I'm not accustom to thin pancakes but they were ok, I was commenting to my wife I'd of preferable eating McDonald's pancakes not to say these were bad pancakes, but I think McDonald's pancakes are better then the average restaurant pancake and that's my opinion.

Or friend actually came here at 9 to wait for a table. Wait was one for for 12 ppl. Def worth it as the traditional Dutch breakfast was worth it. I'm not a huge fan of German/Dutch sausage but the thin pancakes were delicious with fruit. It's a must visit if you at in Solvang. Prepare to wait.,5 star rating,Esther L.

We had Eggs Benedict - eggs were  hard, english muffin was not toasted the sauce was nothing to speak of. We also ordered Swedish Pancakes- the were basically big pancakes that were on the thinner side. Our server never came  to check on us. Oh well it's too bad. Used to be our go to spot.",1 star rating,Susan C.
9/6/2019,"San Francisco, CA","The wait is LONG. Is it worth it? It's good, but not THAT good. We had the danish pancake combo with danish sausage and eggs hemmingway. Danish pancakes are thin, but not quite crepe like. (3.5/5)They had other sausages available but the danish sausage was flavorful. (4/5) if you end up liking it, they sell them in packs that you can cook at home.Eggs hemmingway were the lox version of an eggs benedict. It was better than most salmon eggs Benedict's I've had. (4/5)The only thing I would say that was NOT worth it was the large orange juice. The freshly squeezed juice was tasty and refreshing, but the size of the glass was way too overpriced. I had to double check with the waiter that I ordered a large and she said that it was indeed the large size. You can find tastier spots with less of a wait a few buildings down, however they might be pricier.",4 star rating,Christene M.
2/20/2020,"Anaheim, CA",We had a very nice breakfast here at Paula's Pancake House on our 3rd day here in Solvang and this in my opinion was the best tasting meal of our entire 5 day vacation. My omlet was perfectly cooked and they use a really thick bacon here and the cheese was stringy good and not oily. My wife loved her paper thin pancakes yes they are thin but very wide and very sweet just like the Danish like them. We even bought some pork and venison mixed sausages for my wife's dad back at home. The service here at this restaurant was so friendly thanks to our one of a kind waitress Maya. Thank you Maya!,5 star rating,Chris P.

When I sat down at the bar, the customer nearby got his order. The waitress told me he had ordered the Dutch Pancake special which is what I also did.Although the pancake was huge, it was as thin as a French crepe.  Because it had soaked all of the syrup I had poured, every scrumptious bite had a taste of the syrup. The sausage was the size of a bratwurst. I was not too fond of the taste. I concluded it was a taste to be acquired. Come here hungry if you order it. I could barely eat half of the sausage and the eggs because of the pancake.It satisfied me for several hours and I ended having a light dinner.",4 star rating,Santanu S.

7/31/2019,"San Diego, CA","Paula's Pancake House is a MUST if you're visiting Solvang! It's a staple in this Danish town! Their staff even has Danish clothing on!I first heard about Paula's Pancake House from that tv show ""The Girls Next Door"" about a decade ago. Bridget Marquardt, one of Hugh Hefner's Girlfriends at the time pointed out Paula's Pancake House as they were driving through Solvang on a Roadtrip LOL. I love that show! haha.Anyway, my family and I stopped by Solvand during our mini roadtrip earlier this month. We came pretty early in the morning around 8am. There was already a long line so make sure you put your name on the list ASAP. We were told to check back in 30 minutes to see where we were on the list so we decided to walk around the town. We came back at 30 minutes on the dot and I guess they already called our name so we had to wait again another 20 minutes. That's our fault I guess, so make sure you don't leave the premises. I wish they had a texting system or a buzzer instead so that people don't all have to cram around the front. Let me tell you, that wait line gets LONG! There were so many people you would think there was a celebrity dining there. Luckily we eventually got a table on their patio. It was the 4th of July and a beautiful summer morning. We got to enjoy the sunshine and a hearty meal. I got the eggs benedict which was awesome. My whole family enjoyed their food. Make sure to put this at the top of your Solvang list!",5 star rating,Ramona G.

We made a slight detour to Paula's Pancake House to have breakfast. I'm happy that this place was open so early on a Monday morning.  I wanted something more than a pastry that morning. I got the Danish pancakes with an apple cinnamon topping. It was so good! Danish pancakes are like a mix between a crepe and an American pancake. Not too thick, but still hearty. I didn't need a lot of syrup too. Our server was really friendly. Our orders came or very quickly, but the restaurant wasn't full at 7am.  I can imagine it may take longer when it's at full capacity because there's a lot of tables.The decor can be described as old, but I believe it's meant to be that way.

Shared the pancake as well as an Italian omelet, which is quite a lot for 3 (girls) to share. Regarding the danish pancake, it really just tasted like a very thin pancake. The thinness of a crepe but texture of a pancake. It was good, but I think I've had better outside of Solvang. But if it's your first time, I think it's a solid first! As for the omelet, I don't think it was our style, or at least with the squash and zucchini and having a bunch of juicy vegetables. It made the omelet a bit too wateryThankfully though we didn't have to wait too long for a table!",3 star rating,Jina S.

Luckily this time I came on a Monday and see if he was available he had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the strawberry pancakes. I would've love to have a custom muffin for my Benedict but overall it was really good. Salmon was smoked just right. The strawberry pancakes were very delicious. Nice soft texture, moist center of the pancake. Strawberries were fresh. I'm not a huge sweet guy but these were pretty good with that being said I probably wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes to come here in the future.

We arrived at 8:45 am for a Fourth of July breakfast and they said the wait was 45 minutes. The staff said we could come back after 30 minutes and check to see how far we were on the list for our party of five. The wait time gave us an opportunity to walk around the neighborhood a bit. I set my alarm to make sure we would come back at the 30-minute mark. We came back in time and found that we had already been called. Having missed our turn, we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before we got to sit. It was worth the wait. I got the corned beef hash, hash browns and biscuits for less than $11. Everything was delicious, but the hash browns were particularly amazing. They were crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. Soooo good. Pro tip: Get your name on the list as soon as you can.

We arrived around brunch time and I wasn't particularly taken by any of their breakfast offerings so I opted for tri tip for my entree. My wife ordered one of their traditional offerings - a danish pancake. It wasn't too long before our meals were delivered. The tri tip was quite lack luster - a bit dry as if it was reheated. The pico de galo it was delivered with wasn't great. I was hoping that would top it off the meat that didn't blow me away and kick it up a bit. It didn't. I wasn't impressed with any of it.

3/14/2021,"South Redlands, Redlands, CA","So, my family and I were excited to eat at this place bc we had never been. We drove 3 hours to eat here. We waited for about 45min to be seated which I thought was a good sign that we chose the right spot.... We were so wrong. First, I will say our waitress was awesome!  We ordered our food and I noticed a HAIR in my food when we received it. Being that I didn't want to cause a scene I cut out that part of my danish pancake with the HAIR in it and was going to attempt to enjoy my meal while being disgusted. I go to take another bite and what do you know ANOTHER HAIR!!! I got up and ask to have the waitress come over. They got me a new plate but by the time I got my food my whole party was done eating. I did not enjoy my food bc I had to rush and eat so my party wasn't waiting on me. Frustrated, after getting my bill and seeing that I was being charged full price for my meal, I had the manager (Evelyn) come to the table about the whole situation. She did not care and said that it was a mom and pop shop so there would be no discount. 2 HAIRS in a meal and I get customer service like this. Never again will I go here. This ruined my whole experience at this place and I was excites to dine here. Definitely a shame!

2/25/2019,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA","Paula's Pancake House is an institution in Solvang.  On the western side of downtown Solvang, I would be very frustrated if I waited a long time for a table, but we lucked out with an early arrival and getting our name on the list.  We were seated quickly inside at a large table for our family.The décor is kitchy Danish tourist café.  You don't come for the classic counter seating or the old fashioned wood laminate tables.  There is also a large patio with an equivalent amount of seating (the plastic variety) and some heaters.  You come for the friendly staff and the tasty food.  (Note: Smiles are met with smiles; demanding tourists are met with stiff attention.  Be friendly!)We let our LOs order from the regular menu, and they were over the moon with their Danish Pancakes Topped with Fruit ($9.75).  Two, large and thin Danish pancakes are perfectly cooked with crisp edges and warm and steamy interiors.  Finished with a dusting of powdered sugar and a side of syrup, I recommend getting a little cup of soft butter and the sliced strawberries that are far more flavorful than the apples.  I particularly loved the crunchy little edges.  Of course, I am a fan of thin pancakes.DH and I split an order of pancakes as well as the Danish-Style Sausage and Eggs ($10.50) with a fruit cup, two perfectly poached eggs and a biscuit.  DH would skip the biscuit next time as it was pretty bland, but the sausage and eggs were OFF THE CHARTS!  The fruit was fresh and there was a nice mix with strawberries, cantaloupe, banana, grapes and pineapple.  I just could get over the mild sausage with crisp casing and that unctuous and goopy egg.The Santa Maria Style Chili beans ($3.95) were not my fave as I expected something more like BBQ beans and less like chili, but I think that was my own subjective, false expectation.  Definitely get the cheese and onions as toppers.  Even the LOs liked it.I also STRONGLY recommend the wonderful, fresh squeezed orange juice.  Using local oranges in one of those big machines, it is some of the best orange juice that I have ever had.We loved PPH and can't wait to return.  Our coffee cups stayed full and our desire for some delicious Danish treats was sated.  A great choice!",5 star rating,Stephanie B.

The waitress was very helpful though since it was our first time there. The food came out in a timely manner.

They took a while to come back to see if we needed anything else, which we did and they also took a while to bring back what we needed. Overall the food was good but not what I expected. Tried out the Danish pancakes and its just crepes. The French toast are incredibly small and skinny and the coffee was bland. If you're in solvang and are curious then go ahead and try it but its nothing out of this world.",3 star rating,Rodrigo A.

1/23/2019,"Orange County, CA","It's a must for me to try a breakfast/brunch spot when visiting a new city.  We took a 2.5 hours drive to Solvang since our planned day trip was cancelled.  First thing we needed was some food to recharge. Paula's Pancake House is located between Olsen's Danish Bakery and Solvang Brewing Company.  Most of the parking is along the streets unless you're lucky enough to find one in a private lot.When we arrived around noon, there was several parties waiting for a table.  The hostess said it was about 35 minutes for a party of 2.  We got a patio table in about 15.   I prefer to sit outside because you get the full experience of this small town.  The menu consists of the usual breakfast stuff.  Since they are famous for pancakes hence the name, I had to try some. Our server was very attentive and friendly.  Everyone in Solvang seems so nice.  We started off with fresh squeezed orange juice and hot tea.  Then our breakfast selection: ****Danish pancake combo ~delish!  The pancake is very thin like a crepe.  Topped with your choice of fruit and side.  My fave is always strawberries.  Served with house maple syrup.  I chose the Danish sausage for the side.  Good and not fatty at all. ***Pork chop and eggs ~simple and tasty!  The small boneless pork chop served with a side and cinnamon apples.  The meat was done right so it was tender.  Another option other than steak.  We enjoyed brunch here!  Most likely will come back if we decide to take another trip to Solvang.",4 star rating,Linh C.

Biscuit was delish.Salmon Eggs Benedict, waffles with strawberries as a side. Both so good. Eggs with porterhouse steak was great as well. And kids chocolate chip pancakes my son enjoyed.

11/16/2019,"San Rafael, CA","Whenever I'm in Solvang I try to visit here at least once. Not always an easy thing to do, as this place is popular with locals and visitors alike, even on a weekday morning in mid-November. I got here about 8:30am on a Friday, and easily got a table on the patio. Taylor was my server today, and she quickly greeted me and took a drink order for an iced tea. I took a bit of time trying to decide if I wanted the Danish pancake, waffle, omelette (haven't tried those here yet) or something else. I'm partial to the delicious Danish pancakes, but wanted to see what other plates may be good here as well. I settled on the Belgian waffle, with a side of scrambled eggs. They arrived quickly, the waffle topped with a generous dusting of powdered sugar and a ball of whipped butter. Warm syrup was on the side, just waiting. The eggs looked like more than ""2 eggs"" and were perfectly cooked, moist and yet cooked well. The waffle, the first I've had here, was amazing! Light, almost without mass, yet crispy and crunchy even after dosed with butter and all the warm syrup. Very nice. The eggs were tasty and hot, also nice. The iced tea was a bit watery, or under-brewed (?) as the pic shows, but the least problem of the meal. The place is very nicely decorated, and old cafe feel inside and fresco patio dining for the nice weather you often find in the valley - look forward to returning in Spring.",5 star rating,Mark K.
4/26/2019,"Salt Lake City, UT",First visit to Paula's and the flavour was delicious. Very quaint restaurant among the European style of Solvang. We ordered banana pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. There was banana in the pancakes which made them even tastier. Staff was friendly and service was great. We will be back!Well I brought some family who were in the area to Paulas for a light breakfast and it was delicious. This time we tried the thin pancakes which were served hot and topped with strawberries and whip cream (optional). The price is right for this large platter of pancakes and Paula's is a must when you are in the Solvang area. Enjoy!,4 star rating,Camille P.

This is a perfect light-medium breakfast because the pancakes come super thin but the fruit toppings  and fresh whipped cream really make it feel like you're eating more.My companion got a salmon lox bagel. It comes out deconstructed so you get to build it yourself with how much onion and tomato you want, which I think is neat. And all the ingredients were super fresh and delicious.We ordered a cheesecake with strawberry on top for dessert.

12/27/2018,"San Diego, CA","This place is known for its pancakes and boy does it get packed in the morning especially on the weekends. Paula's pancakes house is located very close to a general parking lot across the street and it's free parking. Solvang itself is adorable in the way all the buildings and homes look, this restaurant adds a cute charm to the small town as well. LONG WAIT TIMEWe came on a Sunday morning and had to wait 1 hour for a table. You can sit either outside on the patio or inside. Which means it is dog friendly when sitting out on the patio. However, the patio is really tight and not much room to really have space for your dog unless the dog is in your lap. Corner tables would probably be able to fit a larger dog but it's all subjective since it depends on what tables are available at that moment. SERVICEThe service wasn't as great as I had hoped considering it's a touristy town but possibly might be due to how busy it was. Normally you don't get the best service when a place is busy. And they often are rushing people to dine in and out. FOOD I got their famous Dutch pancake with strawberries and whip cream. The pancake was interesting in texture and flat. Their strawberries were drenched in syrup which added a nice sugary kick to the pancake since the pancake was kinda bland tasting. I wasn't really a fan of the pancake but it's something to try. I also got their Eggs Benedict, which was alright but nothing spectacular compared to other places. The food didn't blow my mind, just regular $$$ breakfast items. Overall, there are other breakfast places to eat in solvang. This was a one time visit to Paula's and it was a very long wait for breakfast.",3 star rating,Cinnie T.

My danish pancakes and cappuccino were delightful! The pancakes were full of toppings and the syrup gave it just the right amount of sweetness. It was thin but fluffy. I also got hash browns on the sid yep cut the sugar and they were flavorful and crispy. Mi novio's Denver omelet was cooked to perfection with nicely fluffed up eggs.

There is plenty of parking on the streets and designated public parking lots. We came here pretty early and luckily there was no wait, we sat on the outside patio and ordered coffee. Enjoying the views of the beautiful Danish town. We then decided on the Paula's Pancake Special which is 2 thin danish pancakes topped with freshly made whip cream and strawberries, a danish sausage which was so very flavorful, eggs, and toast. Everything we ate here was delicious and so reasonably priced. Great service, great food, and nice atmosphere I'll come back again if I come back.

You can add fruits if you like. I really enjoyed the rubbery texture of the pancakes. I used some of my pancakes to wipe up some runny yolk and it was perfect. Adding a little butter and maple syrup made it even better. My meal came with nicely cooked over easy eggs and a choice of bacon or sausage or danish sausage. I picked danish sausage and it tasted great. The style of the pancakes reminds me a little like crepes. There was a line when we got there. We waited a little bit over 30 mins. The wait was not bad at all. They had benches outside the restaurant for people to sit on.,5 star rating,Joelle C.
8/16/2020,"Murrieta, CA","We found ourselves at Paula's Pancake House, seemed to be one of the popular breakfast places in the area. We got there just as they opened, 8am, are wait time was about 10 min. We were greeted by our server Maria D. and she was eager to make us feel right at home, she did a great job! It appeared that the staff was still getting set up and finding their way because, we waited some time to get menu's and a little longer for coffee. I think this was staff still trying to accommodate the morning rush of people just opening.When it was time to order, we were hoping for crepe's but, they didn't have them on the menu. Our server Maria D. mentioned that the Danish Pancakes were very similar to crepe's so, we tried the house made Danish Pancakes with the Blue Berry topping and fresh made whipped cream. They were good, reminded me of a thin pancake nothing close to a crepe but still good. I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict, comes with fresh fruit and hash brown potatoes. This was disappointing on a few levels. I anticipated a runny poached egg, as you would expect for the dish. Instead I got a HARD poached egg, not even close to the velvety yolk you would expect. Our server Maria D. came by to check on us and when I shared and showed her she said, OH! ""You wanted them Poached soft""? ""REALLY""?? I also wanted to share that the Hollandaise Sauce was broken, and separated, and to add, it was cold. Maria, quickly went to the kitchen and tried to remedy this, she quickly brought back 2 POACHED Eggs, minus the Hollandaise Sauce.... hummm!..oh well? I think this might be due to being under staffed and being in a hurry.I always leave a 15% tip no matter what!

But that's the thing... we weren't home and my husband likes breakfast food. We came here since we were passing by. Husband ordered the 2 flat pancakes with Danish sausage and eggs sunny side up.I had the Danish sausage as well, with english muffin, eggs over easy and hashbrowns. All for about $25, $30 after tipping. We did not like the food. The pancakes were a bit soggy and the sausage was not tasty at all. To be honest the sausages tasted like milk that just spoiled. The utensils also had a smell of spoiled milk to them. The only good thing was the hashbrowns but very small portion. I'm sorry but this is our experience. Service was ok, but the main thing is the food. Would we come back? Definitely not.",1 star rating,Tigerlily T.
12/3/2018,"Honolulu, HI","The food was good. Loved the danish pancakes with apples and syrup. They were very light and not extremely filling like American pancakes, which are doughy. The danish sausage was good too. It wasn't very greasy. Even my toddler enjoyed it. Never saw her eat so much. It was quaint and fun to see our waitresses dressed in Danish attire. But I realize if you don't get there early let's say before 10:30, it gets crowded. A downside of this place are the flies. My husband tried to swat them off me and accidentally spilled syrup in his lap. There needs to be some kind of control over the flies. It is hard to enjoy a good meal when trying to seat them away. You can use fly tape which is hung above. Get a Venus fly trap. Hire an exterminator. Use one of those diy methods of getting rid of bugs.

11/26/2018,"Fullerton, CA","If you are visiting Solvang, definitely give this place a visit. Since the town is so small, it's likely that you'll have some time to grab breakfast/brunch here. DO SO! It gets really busy and when we put our name down around 10am, we were told about 30-40 minutes (which we expected). My recommendation is to keep an eye on your time and then walk over to the Solvang Restaurant for some Aebleskivers. Get 3 of them and share if you're with someone. That'll take the edge of the hunger. (Trust me... nothing is worse than being super hungry in the morning, only to be told you have to wait, and waiting. This delicious snack will put you in a better mood.)They seat you fast and the service and food come out fast. My guess is they get so many customers that they are used to producing food at a high speed. You won't have to wait much longer after you sit down! I recommend the Danish pancakes (not to be confused with Aebleskivers which Paula's does not have but Solvang Restaurant does) with the Danish Sausage. It's also large enough to share if you're in the habit of not finishing your breakfast. My wife and I shared and it was more than enough for the both of us. We got the blueberry compote - yummy! I also really love Danish Sausage. It's not super heavy but has a great herb taste with some onion. Get it if you love sausage. :)",5 star rating,Xiaopan X.

6/16/2019,"La Puente, CA","Really cute place to get your breakfast!  I've been here a couple times during weekday mornings around 8 am and there wasn't a wait at all.  It might be a different story later or during the weekends but I did notice that the tables did start to fill up when we were leaving the place around 9.  I ordered the Classic Benedict ($11.95) with my eggs poached soft and a side of hash browns.  It also comes with a leaf of lettuce, 2 slices of tomato, a slice of apple, and a slice of orange on the side.  They also garnish the benedicts with a half olive on each one.  To be honest, they could forego the olives, lettuce, and tomato completely.  I really did not see any point to adding those at all.  If anything, I'd rather they add the tomato under the eggs so that I'm not trying to balance the tomato on top of the eggs as I'm trying to cut into them.  Not to mention that the olives make my benedicts look a bit uh...suggestive.  I recommend getting the eggs poached soft because the first time I tried them poached hard, and the yolk wasn't behaving the way I wanted it to.  The yolk popped at a different direction from where I wanted it to and it started to run where I didn't want it to run.  The second time around I got it soft and it was much better.  The side of hash browns were good as well.  It's the kind that comes shredded and is fried in a pan so that it sticks together, so it was a bit hard to pick up, so you'll just have to shovel them onto your fork.  I've also had a couple bites of the Paula's Special Danish Pancakes ($10.25) and they were okay in my opinion.  The pancakes are a lot thinner than regular pancakes, it's like a cross between a pancake and a crepe.  I'm not really a sweet tooth, especially when it comes to breakfast, so I would rather much prefer the eggs benedict that I got over this.  I'm not a big orange-juice-for-breakfast drinker, but I highly recommend getting their orange juice ($3.25).  They freshly squeeze their oranges with a giant juice machine near the front.  It does come in a pretty small cup though so it is a bit expensive.  But you know that it's fresh.  Service was great.  As soon as you sit down you are greeted with a pot of coffee.  They constantly asked if we were doing alright and if everything was made to our liking.  Our waters were kept full and if you ask for something they bring it to you very quickly.  If you're spending the morning in Solvang, Paula's Pancake House is a great way to start your morning.",4 star rating,Jenny T.
12/31/2019,"Oakland, CA","I try to make it out to the Pismo/Santa Maria area at least once/year. I certainly liked coming here for the delicious food offered in the past. Our recent visit to Paula's was disappointing, however. It is certainly tough to have to cross off one of your 'Go-To' places off your list.We were here during the mid-week late morning. Not during the weekend rush. The service was still slow. The dining room wasn't crowded, but it seemed a long time for our order to be taken and for the food appear at our table. The staff seemed busy, but they seemed to be not very efficient or just not well focused on prioritizing tasks. Add to that the fact that they missed one of our main ordered breakfast courses and still need to be cooked.Their specialty, Danish Pancakes were under-cooked: A little undone in the middle. Not good. How do you not know how to cook up your specialty of the restaurant? Whaaaat?The eggs and proteins were 'just okay', making the entire meal not worth the disappointment from under-cooked pancakes. Come on Paula's, you're better than that!",2 star rating,william s.

10/20/2020,"Goleta, CA","Sad to make this review because I was such a fan of this place. But after today... never coming here again. Me and my girlfriend both agree this was possibly the worst restaurant experience ever. We drove to Paula's all the way from Santa Barbara to come get some yummy breakfast. As we get there it's a 15 minute wait, which is fine considering how packed this place gets on the weekend. So we waited and got seated outside, with no warning on how many bees there are next to the planter we sat at, at first we paid no mind, only a few were flying around our faces, but then as we got our food, a huge swarm of them came in and flooded our food, literally landing on top of it all, but what made it awful was they wouldn't let us eat !!! Could not enjoy our meal, the bees literally flooded our syrup and there was about 10 bees stuck inside the syrup cup... totally wanna spread that all over my pancakes. Others noticed the bees and started to complain about seating and others worrying about being allergic and the lady understood and reseated the other group, but when I brought to her attention about my table and how bees have literally swarmed all over our food, all I wanted was to be reseated and made new food, instead she offered either we bag it or just wait and get re-seated..at that point I just bout had it, didn't even offer to fix our problem.. so now I'm stuck with a $60 bill and food that was literally infested by bees, our waiter brought out our boxes literally giggling to herself and saying sorry about the bees, I get it's not the waiters fault, but they can totally help us and offer us better alternatives so I can be satisfied with my meal and service. Flat out never coming here again. And I will preach this story to everybody I know. Because it is also ridiculous that after the fact that I made that scene is when they started warning new coming guests about the problem, but we were never addressed. Thanks Paula's.P.s: They didn't even bother offering us even a new syrup cup, showed them flat out how many bees landed in our cup and it he waitress was shocked. Again this could have been solved with:1.Re seating 2. New food made. 3. Even a discount on the meal, i was furious they expected us to pay for a meal we absolutely hated.",1 star rating,Cris F.

His omelet per his words, full of great fixings and eggs was NOT overcooked, perfect to him! I did not taste his meal. Coffee was so fresh and not a hint of a burnt taste.

There was still waiting list but we joined this time. 15 mins later we were seated at the counter. It's actually quite comfortable at the counter. I ordered burger with french fries (i know.

The eggs benedict with lox was one of the best that I have ever tasted. The hollandaise was thick and creamy. The eggs were perfectly poached. And the english muffin was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Danish pancakes were somewhat underwhelming however, even with the cinnamon apples and the homemade whipped cream. I think I prefer the classic buttermilk pancakes instead, which have more substance and richness. Their famous sausages were delicious. They had a nice snap, and the filling was delicious and perfectly seasoned. They do have quite a bit of a fly problem though. I think I saw over 20-30 unique flies buzzing around. The staff was on it with fly swatters and must have assassinated at least 10-15 of them while I was dining.",5 star rating,Joseph L.

The cheese was on top and I would have preferred it inside. It was ok. The biscuit was warm and tasty, the hash browns so so. The coffee was good.

The food is overpriced for the quality.  We ordered the Danish pancakes.  They are more like a crepe with Danish sausage inside.  They weren't great.  We also ordered whole grain pancakes with Danish sausage.  They were okay but at those prices I expect them to be awesome.  IHOP pancakes are better and cost less.  Maybe I just don't like Danish sausage.,3 star rating,Katherine F.
11/24/2019,"San Jose, CA","When I tell you to run from this place, run! Please don't waste your time waiting for a table. This place is way overrated. We came here Saturday and were told there was an hour 10 minute wait. Understandable (anticipating being blown away by their breakfast). We walked around to kill time and we all felt really hungry so we stumbled into another eatery and collectively decided to try Paulas the following day when we weren't feeling so  famished.so lucky we did cause this other place was insanely good. It was freshly made biscuits, the quality of their meat was amazing and their gravy was to die for. Succulent was the place! Go there.At any rate we returned on Sunday, we woke up extra early just to beat the rush. We were seated about 15 minutes later. The disappointment was pretty instant. We ordered a large OJ and the large was about 12 ounces. Why is that large? We ordered from across the menu based on suggestions from our server. As soon as we got our plates, I knew the food would be nothing to write home about. From the bland hash browns, the pale looking sausage, the Denver omelette that just looked sad, the chicken steak that had lukewarm gravy and looked like a slop of white on white. But then came the ""Ribeye"" and eggs. The eggs were uncooked, my steak which I ordered medium came out well done (maybe the half inch thick cut) prevented them from cooking it to temperature. Seriously, it was a sliver of meat, how they have the audacity to call that a rib eye is  beyond me. The biscuits taste store bought and mine was still cool in the middle, which means they're probably frozen. They were dry as hell too. The only thing that was redeemable was the pancake, but even that was just okay. Seriously, why do people wait in line for this long, we all agreed we could've had a better meal at Denny's! We ate a 5 star breakfast the previous day and we had such high hopes. What a bad ending to an otherwise beautiful visit to Solvang.",1 star rating,Laura R.

The only negative was that we literally couldn't finish our meals because bees were swarming our table. I had read about this in previous yelp reviews and thought it wouldn't be a problem, but they weren't lying. We were swatting them away the whole time, so much that my friend accidentally swatted my syrup all over the table which attracted more bees!

4/3/2018,"Portland, OR","Confession, I've never been to Denmark. I know, I know, you're shocked that I would write a review of a Danish pancake House without an extensive knowledge of Danish culture and cuisine. Very unprofessional and uncharacteristic of a Yelp elite, I am aware. Nonetheless, even though it's hard for me to speak to the authenticity of Paula's Pancake house, I will do so anyway. Upon entering Paula's, you will find that there is something familiar and very comforting about this restaurant, very Danish if I dare say. We stopped in for lunch one day while during the Danish town of Slovang and we're very pleased with the result.Paula's is a pancake House, so you'd be remiss if you didn't get the pancakes, which I did. We tried both the Danish style pancakes as well as the more traditional (aka American) style buttermilk pancakes. The buttermilk were very good, we for the pecan ones which had a generous portion of peacans baked in, making them excellent. The Danish pancakes are flatter and larger than their buttermilk brethren, yet with the same flavor and only slightly different texture, which makes them very much worth trying. What I'm saying is, try the Danish pancakes, if it scares you then go back to IHOP and stop reading this.We also tried the Danish sausage, Medisterpolse (I didn't try to pronounce it, I just pointed). It was very tasty and different, with an interesting mix of spices and flavored. Definitely worth the taste. With an order, you get one large sausage which can easily be split between 2-3 people as a snack.Ok, this review is long enough, let's close it out. In summary, next time you're in Slovang, you should totally try Paula's Pancake House. Tell them that I sent you! Though that wont do anything as they have no idea who I am. Still, I'd be curious to see what response you get.",4 star rating,Nick M.

But the temperature was literally 116 degrees the day we went and all seating was outside and our server was cool as a cucumber and so pleasant.

On a recent trip to Solvang I decided to stop here for breakfast and was seated outside. As soon as my food arrived wasps started pestering me and landed on the food. By the time I got a hold of the manager they were all over the place. There were at least 4 wasps on my food when she arrived. She clearly saw the problem but said she wouldn't bring me a new place to go or remove the dish from the check. Her response was that they aren't dirty so it wouldn't be bad to eat the food that they had been on and to make a new plate would be a waste of food.I was completely offended and taken back by her disregard to my concern.

We ordered 2 plates of their plain danish wheat pancakes with cream and strawberries on the side. Eggs over easy and their Danish sausage. LOVED their pancakes.... it's more of a crepe, at least to us vs the American style pancakes. Their sausage was deelicious. Kinda tasted like liverwurst but with more flavor. Their eggs as simple as it was, tasted different than the store bought eggs we're used to eating. Idk if the overall feel of the place already made its influence to our tastebuds as well, but i swear the runny yolk tasted different! Lol!And this is what I appreciated most of all...

Their coffee was great, too, although I think they need bigger mugs. After the meal, my husband even said, ""I am ready for round two!"" That never happens.

And Paula's Pancake House was the perfect place to try this. The service was super quick and fast. The servers were also prompt. I was seated almost immediately when I walked in and serviced very quickly. This morning I decided to order the pancake and sausage combo. When I asked the waitress about it, she confirmed that the sausage would be the Danish sausage and not some other sausage. Food came really quick, The food looked great for the most part. The sausage was nice, plump, and flavorful. Definitely would have bought some sausages to-go if my scheduled would have allowed it. Eggs were done well, perfectly over easy. The pancakes are massive. Although they are thin, they are super filling. For me, I could have done without the powdered sugar as a personal preference. But, they do add a decent amount of powdered sugar when serving the pancakes. If you don't want as much sugar or no sugar at all, I would advise you to let your servers know.

The good news is they serve breakfast all day. The California omelet is a fav as well as the Danish sausage. Don't do carbs or like pancakes? Order them anyway.

1/9/2018,"Houston, TX","I've been putting off this review of Paula's because I haven't been feeling it. And I definitely wasn't feeling the food when I came either.The wait is about on-par with popular brunch spots in bigger cities, but I just don't get the hype. Admittedly, against the better judgment of many of those who came before me and tried the Danish omelette, I got the Danish omelette. The sausage had this uber-strange quality to it. Definitely wasn't under-salted, but it might've lacked the spices typical of other sausages that made it taste bland. It didn't help that they put massive chunks of sausage in the omelette, because it made it difficult to chew. Way too much Havarti cheese on top AND in the eggs -- it tasted like I had stepped into a cave aging dairy products. The biscuit was solid, though, and whipped butter was the right choice for something so dense and flaky.My significant other's Danish pancake was way better. Massive and with a generous topping of apples, we tried to finish it and it defeated us. His side of scrambled eggs came more fried than wet, so you want to be more specific than usual with your preferred egg order.Now, onto more unsavory things: I've really got to wonder why they have such a big fly problem when it seems their neighbors and other restaurants around town don't. Maybe close for a day and find the source of the eggs, or invest in fly traps/industrial strength fans? This was an issue it appears that other Yelpers have dealt with as well, but to no avail.Service is okay -- nothing special and nothing that'd convince me to come back.",3 star rating,Gwen W.

I usually get the hot cinnamon apples on top. The Danish sausage is also very tasty!The prices are very reasonable and the service is fast, friendly and efficient. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the long lines... but here's a tip for you: sit at the bar! If you're willing to sit at the bar instead of a table, you can get in a lot faster!",4 star rating,Stacy S.
7/5/2019,"River Edge, NJ","Felt like I was eating inside Disney.We got there about 20 minutes before the 4th of July parade was over which meant that we waited a bit less than those who strutted over once the parade was over (Overheard a family of 4 had to wait an hr and 30 while my mom and I waited about 20min tops). I got a dutch style pancake with sausage and scrambled eggs while my mom got a bagel with creamcheese. I added a side of hashbrown. The meal itself was mediocre, mom says the bagel is sub-par, and the pancakes were just okay. But the atmosphere and the whole theme of the restaurant made up for the not-bad-but-not-great food. Our waitress was also very friendly which was also a plus. Wouldn't mind going again only if the wait is 20-30min.",4 star rating,Yura L.

Also, they have a serious fly problem...",3 star rating,Ophelia S.
8/10/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Only things they do well are the pancakes and service. They don't know how to cook eggs, sausage or bacon - probably worse than IHOP or Denny's for those items, truly. Don't believe the hype; most people like the cheapest stuff and flock to crowds. If you want a truly delicious meal besides Paula's great pancakes, go to Succulent next door (great French toast and Eggs Benedict). Slightly pricier but well worth it.",3 star rating,Zach M.

11/20/2018,"Temescal Valley, CA","The service is great and efficient here and the food is delicious! They have all of your standard breakfast fare, perfect for setting out on a long day of winery, cidery, brewery and distillery visits! It's no surprise this is such a longstanding and popular destination for tourists and locals. There is outdoor seating that *in theory* is dog friendly, but it's so crowded and there is so much activity, I think bringing Fido is setting yourself up for either a stressed out pooch or a squashed pup when one of the servers potentially trips over them -- there just isn't any floor or seating space to spare, because they want to serve delicious food to as many people as possible during the morning rush.It's a family friendly spot and families you'll see... The wait can be really long during the busy times, especially if there are more than two people in your party and you have a specific preference of indoor or outdoor. Bring snacks for the kids (and grown-ups) in your party who get hangry easily, or have them go pre-game at one of the many other bakeries in the vicinity while you hold the post for your table.",5 star rating,Cara C.

Our server was super attentive and also super quick in making sure we got our food in a timely manner and enjoyed it too. We ordered hot chocolates to start which are topped off with their homemade whipped cream. Can you say delicious? We got our breakfast served super quick which was a bonus considering the fact that we were both starving. The breakfast was delicious, I'm telling you this place never disappoints and always hits the spot. We arrived, ate and left this place probably in a total of 30 minutes.

Immediately upon walking in I fell in love with the dining room, very homey wood walls and maroon carpet. The Danish pancake combo was delicately sweet and plenty to share between 3 of us. Definitely recommend adding strawberries. It's $2 extra, but I didn't drive 200 miles to suddenly draw the line at strawberries. Thanks for having us!",5 star rating,Beril P.
10/22/2019,"Camas, WA","Paula's Pancake House is an awesome spot for brunch with friends when visiting Solvang. For the full experience, come on a Saturday or Sunday morning before continuing your day into wine country or the beach nearby. However, you can either get there and wait in a really long line, or you can take the smarter route and show up when they open, put your name down, and come back at that reserved time. They wouldn't take over-the-phone reservations and could only put our name on the list the morning of, so my friend and I literally walked over at 9:00am, made our reservation for 11:00am and came back 2 hours later with our group of 12 girls for brunch! It was great to bypass the 90 minutes wait that had accumulated by that point.The danish pancakes are obviously a must. They are super popular for the texture and milky/creaminess to them. They are so soft and flavorful. Similar to a crepe but just slightly thicker. The eggs benedict were also very filling and the hollandaise sauce was delicious and not over-empowering like most I've had.Enjoying brunch in Solvang is a must, and Paula's is definitely a great choice. Just be prepared to a long line, and some slow service because of the turnout they get all the time.",4 star rating,Natacha S.
11/7/2017,"Laguna Hills, CA","Walking around Solvang on a Friday morning and for some reason, everything seemed to be dead... until we turned the corner and saw a very busy restaurant and figured, there must be a reason why everyone wants to eat here. We got lucky and our party of four very hungry people were seated immediately. Very quaint and homey interior, feels like eating at a cabin, they have fresh orange/peach and strawberry preserves on the table for your toast and what not. Ordered their Danish omelette (Danish sausage & Havarti cheese) with fresh fruit and toast. The Danish pancakes with the warm cinnamon apples (YES!) and the maple syrup. We also did another order of Danish pancakes with eggs and bacon. That was good. Danish pancakes are thin and almost look like a crepe but crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. If you're an OHOP fan, this is reminds me of the 49er. The service is good, food came in a very timely manner. We were satisfied with our meals. Overall, nice breakfast place, cozy and very homey.",4 star rating,Bay M.

It's kind of vintage, historic, Small & old style with good food.  We got there around 10 am on Monday and there was Waite of about 20 mints before we get seated. Tara was our server whom did a good job take cars of us. Part of 4 we ordered veggies omelet, and whole wheat pancake with honey that my wife &I share and our friends ordered danish pancakes  & sausage plus danish pancakes & strawberry , all dishes came out with good portions and good.

Starts of a good wine tasting experience.  Very healthy servings and farm fresh salad and veggies. The servers wear the traditional Danish dress which is cute- but why don't you have male servers? Cutest was a family who sat next to our table- when asked what they want they answered singing in unison ""PANCAKES "". What a pleasant experience. I would go a little off peak hours though- the wait for the outside can take a whileWe were back for breakfast. Large crowd but no wait for 2. Great food, wonderful service and far superior to the local competition for breakfast.",5 star rating,Tommy L J.

My family and I have been coming here for years, and have made it a Thanksgiving tradition to come from brunch every year as it is open on Thanksgiving day.First off, it really makes you feel like you're in an authentic Danish restaurant with the decor of the restaurant and how all the waitresses are dressed in cute, traditional Danish attire. The wait staff has always been very attentive and nice. I always order the danish pancakes (that are thinly cooked, almost like crepes) and am in love with their sausages. I usually am not a fan of sausages in general but these ones are very delicious! The jams are all homemade as well so I always use them with my pancakes. All of their jams, pancake mixes, and sausages are available for purchase if you would like to recreate these dishes yourselves along with danish cookies. They also have other things such as steak and eggs and regular buttermilk pancakes. I've come with family and friends who have gotten a variety of other orders and we have always been satisfied with our meals!",5 star rating,Elizabeth C.

Pancakes was between a crepe and American pancake in thickness, loved the crispy edges. Cinammon apples were apple pie filling yummy,  not too sweet or tart.  Top it off with maple syrup and butter and Bob's your uncle. Sausage was mild and good.

11/5/2017,"Allen, TX","My dude arrived in Solvang 9 AM on a Thursday and breakfast was in order. The inside was a little packed while the outside area had plenty of tables, which made sense as it was a chilly morning. Luckily we got the last open table and when we left, there were a few customers waiting outside.The inside of the restaurant has a very traditional, old school Danish feel. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful, and even offered us samples of the famous Danish sausage. My dude ended up getting the Danish sausage and eggs plate, which came with hash browns and a biscuit. I got the Danish pancakes (2) with the same sausage and eggs. The Danish packages were pretty large in size, but thin like a crepe. I had it served with whipped cream which was really rich and tasty... if I am not mistaken, it was made fresh. The Danish sausage was really good too, with a mild spice to it. The orange juice was also nice and fresh.Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast here and I can see why this is a popular breakfast place in Solvang; I'd recommend it!",4 star rating,Mafel L.

They had lots of waitresses on duty and it wasn't that crowded. The servers seemed more interested in chatting with each other instead of their guests. Many of the servers had jackets on over their uniforms. This again is so off-putting. Wear sweaters, not winter jackets. I had the Danish pancake which was very good. The food is definitely overpriced, but it is in a prime tourist area, so that could be overlooked if the ambiance and service were worth it. Upon leaving, several workers saw us heading for the door. Noone expressed thanks for coming, have a nice day or anything. We like to spend our money where it is appreciated. We won't be back.",1 star rating,Shell L.

We had a table outside on the patio which was nice and refreshing. We had good service and I definitly want to come back. If you are in town Paula's is great for breakfast/lunch. We had fresh squeezed orange juice which was so yummy on top of our meals. I had eggs Benedict that was made just like I ordered. My co-workers were just as happy with their food.

It was not busy and people just seemed to be standing around. Someone finally came by the 3rd time we waived someone over. We got the danish pancakes topped with warm blueberries and maple syrup. The pancakes are large, but thin. They are kind of like open faced crepes. It tasted good, but it was not filling. We also ordered their turkey burger which comes with the soup of the day (homemade potato leek). The burger and soup tasted ok. Not bad, but not special either. I also noticed the salt and sugar holders on the table were covered with jam... good thing we didn't need to use them. Overall, subpar service and ok food.",2 star rating,Susan D.
9/11/2017,"Riverside, CA","On a Labor Day trip through Solvang my girlfriend and I decided to stop by take in the sights of the Dutch town and get breakfast. As what most new people in town do we turned to Yelp to help us find some good eats. After finding a place to park we decided to walk to Paula's Pancake House since it wasn't too far. Once arrived we was told by the staff at the podium that that the wait time would be a 30 - 40 minute for the two counter seats. This restaurant was one of the busiest that we saw on our walk to Paula's Pancake House.Looking at the seats filled with guest at the patio and the number of people waiting outside it sounded about right. So I ask my girlfriend if she wanted to check out the Succulent Cafe Wine Charcuterie we passed by on the way to Paula's Pancake House. She said sure, so we went on our way to check it out while we wait.Upon returning, we were seated fairly quickly about another 5 - 10 minute wait. The counter seats were nice with a view of the staff working. After looking through the menu we decided to go with Danish Pancake Combination (we ordered the Danish pancake, Danish sausage, and over easy eggs). The Danish pancake spread with light syrup and butter were good. The Danish sausage casing was a bit chewy and hard to cut, which tasted okay. The staff recommended eating the Danish sausage with some Dijon mustard, which gave it some flavor.",3 star rating,Sam W.

We told the manager and instead of issuing us a refund, argued with us and refused our refund. We just paid an left.  This is the worst costumer service I have had in a restraint for a long time.  Someone needs to be retrained.

Such a bummer! :(First and foremost, the ambiance of this restaurant is very homey with old-style wallpapers and curtains. The waitress's uniforms were cute and looked so apt for this place. You could dine by the counter, or just at the tables inside or outside on the patio too! We were seated soon enough as we were there almost near their closing time. Would have loved to dine on their patio but there weren't very many people at that time so chose to sit inside.My husband ordered a locally brewed beer which was nice and refreshing. The name of the beer was Figueroa Mountain Danish Red Lager. Also ordered a Fruit Milkshake made of some strawberries and bananas topped with a dollop of whipped cream! Oh my God! That was so rich and yummy!! In the food, we ordered Paula's Special Danish Pancakes topped with fresh strawberries and their housemade fresh whipped cream & Veggie Sandwich with a side of fruit and hashbrowns. Both the dishes were quite good but with the pancakes, the whipped cream wasn't smooth, more like chalky and paste-like. The pancakes were thin almost like crepes but very airy and light in texture.Rating the following out of 5:AMBIANCE - 5Cosy and a very comfy setting.FOOD- 4Figueroa Mountain Danish Red Lager - 4Fruit Milkshake - 5Paula's Special Danish Pancakes - 4Veggie Sandwich - 4CUSTOMER SERVICE - 5Our waitress was really sweet and helped us choose the milkshake and we loved it!WAIT TIME - 5No wait time.HYGIENE - 5Clean restrooms and well-kept place.PARKING - 4There is street parking right in front of the restaurant but those may get occupied really quickly during the rush times.

Nothing to call home about. I ordered the eggs Florentine, added bacon. The poached egg was a bit underdone, and there was an eggshell in it. Again, not the end of the world. I ate it, and it was exactly what I ordered. My husband ordered the Dutch pancakes and an orange juice- he gave it a 5 out of 5. Said the orange juice is a must, as are the pancakes.

Since the very first time I ate there 2 decades ago until this past week, they have absolutely crushed the breakfast game. The food is always exactly as ordered. The flavor is always right on point. And the staff...simply amazing. My recommendation will always be to get the Danish pancakes. Even if you order something else as your main course, get 1 or 2 of these on the side. You won't regret it!The cons: the main downside to Paula's is the wait. Most of the time during breakfast hours you will find a decent wait of 10 to 20 minutes. Go on a weekend or holiday and this will double. If you have a small party of one or two, you should be able to find a spot at the breakfast bar.Enjoy and breakfast on!",5 star rating,David P.

The servers all seemed to move normal speed rather than a sense of urgency. Our server was not very friendly. Once we got our food she didn't check back to see how it was. The food was very mediocre. Nothing special about it whatsoever. I got the Irish Benedict and the hash was clearly canned or frozen. No real flavor. I had requested a side of avocado when I ordered my food. I was told it was $1.50 extra.I said that was fine. To then get the side and it was just three little tiny slices of avocado. Very disappointing. The best part about all the food was the side of bacon. We received quite a few pieces and it was good. But expensive. I also had gotten a mimosa to then find it was $11! Will not return to this place! It was packed, loud, mediocre service, just okay food and then super expensive! Our bill was around $50 for two for breakfast!

We got the Danish pancake combo with sausage and sunny side up egg, with a side of scrambled and thick cut bacon. The pancake was delightful! So soft and not too heavy like the normal buttermilk pancakes. It was a nice change, I loveed it. BUT THE DANISH SAUSAGE THOUGH I have never had a more ""smooth"" textured sausage?? If that makes sense?? The pork/beef ground up inside was so fine that the sausage was just one smooth bite. This IS the go-to pancake place imo!

Usually I find American pancakes to be thick, dense and heavy. The Danish ones were light and airy, and thin as a crepe. The Danish sausage was also very good, even though it does not look appealing.

I ordered coffee and the Danish omelet. The omelet with nice and fluffy, topped with Muenster cheese, and stuffed with more Muenster cheese and Danish sausage. The omelet was great, even though with the cheese on top of the omelet as well as within, there was way too much cheese for me. The sausage tasted good, and the omelet over all was pretty tasty. I ordered tomato slices as a side, because how often do you get that option, and whole wheat toast that came pre-buttered. They have two types of jam to put on your toast, including strawberry and apricot, and both tasted amazing. The woman working at the counter was super busy, so even though she smiled every now and then, I wouldn't call her friendly per se. I will, however, say that she was efficient in her job. Probably my favorite part about this place are the Danish dresses the waitresses wear. They are incredibly cute, and it's one of the biggest charming qualities about this place in my eyes.",4 star rating,Jonathan R.
7/10/2017,"Dublin, CA","When in Solvang, eat danish pancakes and aebleskivers. That's all you gotta know. Now, go forth and eat some pancakes yo!We came in at 8a on a Saturday to beat the long wait times that started around 9a. The restaurant has a very homey feel and the staff look super cute dressed in costume. We ordered the Paula's Special, which was danish pancakes with fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream, and the Danish-style Sausage and Eggs. I personally didn't care for the sausage, which reminded me of medieval times and I could see why people eat it with hot sauce, but I loved the pancakes. The pancakes were thin but not quite a crepe; buttery and filling without leaving a heavy feeling in your stomach. At around $10 a plate, this is a solid pick for a light brunch/breakfast! Gotta save room for those aebleskivers anyhow!",4 star rating,Sophia Y.
8/2/2020,"Irvine, CA",Highly recommend getting here early in the morning to avoid the wait. We arrived at 8am and were seated right away and maybe at 8:30am there was already a line. We had the Danish pancake combo and it was delicious. I've never had a danish pancake before and they were awesome! The service was also very speedy. Would definitely go back!!,5 star rating,Chelsea T.
10/7/2018,"Oxnard, CA","We first visited Paula's pancake house on Fourth of July of this year, when we checked in they had a one hour wait.We decided to stay because it looked like everywhere else was busy as well.We ended up sitting outside in the patio after 45 minutes of waiting. The food was good and the service was good but not excellent. We came back to Paula's pancake House about two weeks ago on a Tuesday morning and we wanted to sit inside because we just love the Decore and the ambience inside. We were seated and we ordered a bottle of champagne with some orange juice and coffee for everyone, since the minute we walked in our waitress was very nice and very polite we were offered some other juices to go along with our champagne. We ordered food, everything was excellent,  food came out only about 10 minutes after we ordered and everything was very tasty. We ordered the ham breakfast special and it was huge, pancakes are always my favorite thing on the menu.Our cup of coffee was always full and we ended up going back for breakfast for the two remaining days that we had in the area.Overall I recommend this breakfast restaurant if you're in the area, it's a must!",5 star rating,Charlie S.
7/24/2018,"Santa Clarita, CA","On a trip from the Los Angeles area to visit Hearst Castle, I planned a quick stop in Solvang for an anticipated delectable Danish flared breakfast.We arrived at about brunch time and put our name on the wait list for Paula's Pancake House. Of course there was a list because everyone else seemed to have the same idea. But in all actuality, the Solvang area seemed to be pretty active at the time with many folks mixed in the hustle and bustle of getting their Danish fix on.It was a super extremely outrageously hot day. What's with the hot days this summer? Anyway, I could feel the sun beating down my leather vans so hard it was like the feeling of sitting on hot leather cars seats after hours of magnified sun exposure. My shoes were so hot I was about to take them off and throw them across the street like a hot potato or a sizzle Danish sausage. But I wouldn't to a Danish sausage of course... or a hot potato for that matter.Talking about Danish sausages, I ordered a side with my omelette all of which was very, very.... uh very deeeelicious. Why don't all sausages taste this good?!?! Some places could learn a thing or two about how to make sausages from the Danish. And the omelette was one of the best omelettes I've ever had gosh darn it. Yum! What a great idea it was to make this stop.We left with our bellies satiated, our palates very well satiated and content and off we went to view the amazing curations of Mr. WIlliam Randolph Hearst.",5 star rating,Eddie C.
1/26/2020,"Escondido, CA","This place is homey and quaint. A great place to come with your family if you are looking for a decently priced meal. However I was confused because when I typed in ""gluten free breakfast"" this was the first thing to pop up. They do not offer any sort of gluten free bread, waffles or pancakes. They do technically have gluten free options because you can get an omelette with hash browns and fruit. But I was expecting a gluten free pancake or French toast option. Service was a little slow because they were busy. However our waitress was very polite when I asked about gluten free options and recommended a corn tortilla instead of sour dough bread. Rather than paying extra for a whole side of fruit with my omelette. This is a cute place for breakfast, but done expect any gluten free pancakes :(",4 star rating,Christina T.

The food was amazing, but the planters that line the outdoor seating area were swarming with bees. I spent a lot of time during my meal just swatting away bees and trying not to get stung. I sincerely hope that Paula's can do something about the bees, instead of telling customers to ""stay still"" to avoid being stung. Also, it would be greatly appreciated if there were fans and/or misters outside - it's been pretty hot, and one customer had to be taken away in an ambulance because they had heat stroke. Highly, highly recommend requesting to sit inside if you decide to visit. My experience was not worth the $56.",1 star rating,Ashley B.

Friendly staff with danish outfits. Everything is well maintained and quaint. It's like being invited over at a danish friends house for meal.I got the spinach salad and wasn't disappointed. The 4 of us ate just fine with 3 plates. There's a kids menu off the menu. Of course you need to get the pancakes. Will definitely be back. If you can't wait, you could grab a small bite next door to tie you over until they seat you. Big hug, Paula!",5 star rating,Susannah K.
9/2/2018,"Morgan Hill, CA","My first time trying danish pancakes and they were pretty good! Exactly as expected. I ordered the Danish pancakes (with butter and maple syrup) and also got to try the Paula's special and the Danish sausage plate. Would probably recommend getting some rendition of their pancakes, since that's what they are known for. The savory dish I tried was just okay. We literally got our coffee and food in lightning speed. A+ service! Come early or be prepared to wait a bit for your table. We came at around 8:30 and had to wait 15-20 mins on a Saturday (long weekend). Overall great experience and did not break the bank.",4 star rating,Tiffany S.

Another bonus- even during the busy time- we only waited 20 minutes to be seated. A must do during your Slovang trip!",5 star rating,Bridget L.
5/21/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","The wait was not nearly as long as I thought it would be.  We were seated within 5 minutes of putting our name in and got a nice seat outside.  The wait is shorter if you're willing to sit at the counter, too.  I ordered the danish pancake combination with bacon and eggs.  I asked about Danish sausage and the server said we could try it.  I'm so grateful she did, since i was not a big fan.  The service and food was very good.  The food came out quickly and the bacon was delicious.  The pancakes were thinner than normal pancakes yet thicker than crepes.  These were delicious with fresh strawberries on top.  I would definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in Solvang.",4 star rating,Alana M.

7/2/2017,"San Jose, CA","I was actually pretty excited to try this place especially since it was across the street from my hotel and the exceptional Yelp reviews. My experience was so so, but the food did not warrant me giving this place 4+ stars.If you're paying a visit to this place on a holiday weekend, anticipate a 40 minute - 1 hour wait. The manager in charge of taking down names was a tad but rude, so watch out for that.We ordered the danish pancake combination with danish sausage and scrambled eggs ($10.75) and the california special omelette with fruit and a biscuit ($11.25). The danish pancakes were pretty good because they were light and thin. The danish sausage was pretty plain, so I'd definitely skip out on that. The omelette was okay, but definitely could've used some meat. I think my favorite part of the omelette meal was the fruit. I definitely expected a lot more from this place, so I was pretty sad to leave not wow'ed by my visit.",3 star rating,Joanne Y.
5/15/2019,"Oceano, CA",Went there on May 14th 2019 for breakfast with my friends for a girl trip. I don't want to get into detail but let's just say when we were going to be seated at our table there was a corpse on the floor by the door. Unfortunately someone did lose their loved one & the entire restaurant didn't even mind. Everyone went on with their breakfast as if there wasn't a dead body on the ground. Yes it was covered but they should have evacuated the entire restaurant. It was so disrespectful & just morally wrong.  I have pictures but for the respect of the family I will not post them. It just felt so wrong we did not stay. We left without even ordering.Ps the morgue did come while we were there. It wasn't like ignored or anything although it almost felt like it.,1 star rating,Julia M.

Coming down to Paula's on a weekend for breakfast, expect to wait at least an hour for a table but it is worth the wait. A lot of the breakfast items you find on the menu are standard breakfast items (eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, toast, etc) which was good but this time we tried the Irish Benedict (poached eggs with corned beef hash) and I will tell you, this is worth another trip coming back. Orders of Pancakes and Waffles was the sizes of large plates. Great place to take the family for breakfast and walk it off walking through the Dutch village.",4 star rating,Nico W.
3/29/2017,"Irvine, CA","My boyfriend and I were in Solvang for the day and Paula's was on my list.  To our surprise, we only waited about 5 minutes before they were able to seat us outside! I saw that a friend of ours had eaten here before and her pictures looked so good, we decided to order the exact same thing.  We got their Danish Pancakes with Strawberries, Danish Sausage with eggs and hash and a side of biscuits and gravy!  We also ordered a ""large"" cup of orange juice which might possibly be one of the best OJ i've ever had?!  So sad that a ""large"" was a regular sized cup... how small is the ""small"" then?! Anyways, the food came out super quick and luckily all at once.  The pancakes were thin and crepe like.  It was topped with strawberries, powdered sugar and whipped cream which was all it needed.  No syrup necessary.  The pancakes were super light with a very subtle sweet taste to them.  The Danish Sausage was also pretty good but honestly I can't tell the difference between sausages. Don't get me wrong, this was very flavorful but if you didn't tell me these were ""Danish"" sausages, I'd think they're regular breakfast sausages, but bigger.  The biscuits and gravy was probably the heaviest part of our meal but it was sooooo good.  My boyfriend didn't care too much for them, and I usually don't for this kind of food but the gravy.... wow. Overall, a solid spot for breakfast or brunch!  I'd recommend coming early or at an off time to avoid the wait!  They have seats inside and out but I'd definitely recommend dining outside if you can :)",4 star rating,Regina O.

12/20/2019,"Sunnyvale, CA","This place is a must visit whenever you stop by Solvang. The breakfast and lunch options are expansive and service is fast and friendly. We came by on a Sunday morning and saw a huge line but was given an estimated wait of 15 minutes and we were seated before then! The lines seem to be for large groups waiting to be seated so if you're a party of two it doesn't seem to take too long a wait. We sat outside next to the lovely flowers and had a great brunch. I ordered the ""world famous"" Danish pancakes with sausage on the side and the husband got the eggs benedict. When something's world famous you have to try it. The pancakes are crepe thin and have a buttery and slightly sweet flavor. The sausage on the side was a perfect compliment to balance out the sweet but you can also order your pancakes to be topped with fruit-strawberry and apple seemed to be the most popular options. These are delicious and I highly recommend trying them or getting a plate to share as the pancakes are huge. The eggs benedict are delicious too-perfectly poached eggs and tasty hollandaise sauce. We've been coming here since 2009 and it's still our favorite breakfast place in Solvang.",5 star rating,Jennifer T.

12/13/2020,"Manhattan, New York, NY","This is one of the best places I have ever been in my entire life, and I visited here from New York City where there are tons of pancake houses in diners who serve pancakes. We had the most lovely experience with the receptionist/server named Victoria. She was so sweet and so caring and was really patient with us as well. We ordered the pancakes with eggs and sausage and it was absolutely phenomenal. I have never had pancakes this good, they really put IHOP to shame. The pancakes were fluffy warm sweet and so delicious. The sausage was absolutely incredible and cooked to perfection and the eggs were exactly how we ordered them. And by the way the coffee was incredible also. We went around the town while waiting for our food and Victoria was so observant, she kept our food hot until she saw us walking towards the restaurant to pick up our order. I am so impressed with this place and if I didn't live thousands and thousands of miles away I would be there every single day. But I will say, it really has made me think about booking more flights to California just so I can visit Slovang and I can get these pancakes again. If I could I would give this place 15 million stars, but unfortunately yelp only allows for a 1 to 5 rating, so I must settle for a five.

I will admit, it is been a deterrent for me. I hate waiting! It makes me hangry! So I took a chance and went on a SUNDAY MORNING! What was I thinking? Surely I had made a mistake. To my surprise it took only 2 mins for us to be sat. Score! As I was being sat, I looked around and saw almost every table had the same items, the Danish pancakes. Well I was sold! We ordered quickly and the food came out within 10 mins. Yet another score! I'm sure the kitchen staff is pumping out those danish pancakes all morning long!It was insanely good! Danish pancakes are nothing more than thin pancakes, similar to a crepe, with some strawberries and whipped cream on top!I do have to mention the bacon! It super thick and has this amazing smoky sweet flavor. My breakfast was so good! I'm glad I took that risk!Small tip, parties of 2 get sat quicker, everyone waiting was part of a large party.

Danish Omelette ($10.25): The omelette was served with two sides - chose the hash browns and biscuit (additional $0.50 for gravy... GET IT). Generous amount of cut up danish sausages scrambled in the omelette, topped with two slices of havarti cheese. Danish Pancake Combo ($10.25): Two eggs, bacon or sausage served with the Danish pancake. Very similar look and taste to a crepe. The syrup was a lot thinner than regular syrup but overall, DELISH. Would definitely recommend trying the pancake.-1 star for the service.

3/18/2019,"San Ramon, CA",Second time here in 3 years. Cute quaint town and cute quaint breakfast spot. The danish pancakes are like thin pancakes and I like them better because easier to eat. You can get fruit and whipped cream on them but we just had them plain - as they come with butter and sprinkled with a little powdered sugar. We also had the danish sausage which is more like brat wurst - it was too large for a breakfast meat for me but for someone who is a big meat eater it would be perfect. The coffee was not bad but I wouldn't stop just for the coffee. Definitely worth a try for the danish pancakes and sausage.,4 star rating,Jeannette L.

1/15/2018,"Santa Clara, CA","When I think of cute towns in California, Solvang always comes to mind. With its beautiful architecture, delicious food, and friendly climate, this Danish city attracts hordes of tourists each year. Whether you've been here a hundred times, or maybe it's your first trip out, you ALWAYS have to 1. Check out Solvang's bakeries, 2. Try the aebleskiver (sweet doughnut holes), and 3. Visit the gift shops.But after my most recent trip to Solvang, I have another *required* suggestion for guests: Experience Paula's Pancake House. Even if you're not a huge fan of pancakes (I personally prefer waffles), you will love this restaurant. My girlfriend and I ate here a couple weeks ago, and we both felt like it truly embodied the spirit of Solvang. Despite the name, Paula's Pancake House serves a variety of brunch options. If you're not thinking about pancakes, this place has omelettes, Eggs Benedict, steak, and even waffles. Yes, waffles!!! Plus, they also have salads and burgers. Unfortunately, no aebleskiver though. Even with the insane popularity (has over 1.7k reviews!) though, prices here are quite affordable. On average, I don't see anyone paying over like $15 a person for his/her meal. My girlfriend got Buttermilk Pancakes (x2) and I ordered the Boneless Center Cut Pork Chop and Eggs. Here's what we thought:-- DELICIOUS AND FILLING FOOD --It's hard to not be pleased at most brunch restaurants because you're guaranteed to get a large amount of food. The question though is whether everything tastes good. Check both off the list because Paula's Pancake House had great tasting food, PLUS they gave us humungous portions. First off, my Pork Chop and Eggs was stellar. The pork was decently sized, juicy, and not too oily. It was also tender and very easy to cut through. As for the eggs, I got them sunny-side up. I thought they were cooked perfectly, and the yolk served as a delicious topping for my pork. It could have stopped there, but NOPE. This dish was made even better because of the crispy hash browns, hot biscuit, and sweet caramelized apples. Especially with the price (~$11), it was pretty much everything I could have asked for and then some! When it came to my girlfriend's pancakes, she thought they were all right. Her only complaint was for the strawberries, which came out a bit soggy. In my opinion, I thought their pancakes lived up to the name!-- TOP QUALITY SERVICE -- One of the best parts about Paula's Pancake House was the amazing service. For example, the waitress who served us at the counter was SO friendly and courteous. Like, the first thing she did was ask if we wanted water. What a surprise, considering that this restaurant had a policy of not offering water unless requested! Plus, I appreciated that the hostess was SPOT-ON to the exact minute when telling us how long it would take before we got seated. -- COZY AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT -- I loved the interior of this restaurant! Though Paula's Pancake House was quite small, the decor and flower arrangements really made this a great place to eat at. If you're a big fan of outdoor seating, you'll be pleased to know that there are plenty of tables outside! -- GREAT LOCATION --Paula's Pancake House has probably the best spot in Solvang since it's found right in the heart of town on Mission Drive (Highway 246). If you're a tourist, chances are you will most definitely come through this area by foot or car, and so it's totes a convenient place to eat at. Parking might be a bit difficult, but there should be some spots nearby around the residential areas (about a block away). If you're planning on coming, I do recommend ARRIVING EARLY because this place gets PACKED. Especially with a large party, you might end up waiting a long time for bunch. It took my girlfriend and I maybe about 20 minutes before we finally got in. Tranquil, delicious, and respectful. These are the words I would use to describe the city of Solvang. And, they are also the ones I would use to characterize Paula's Pancake House. The food at this gem was great, affordable, and filling. Plus, the service was amazing and the ambiance was appropriate. If I had to recommend one restaurant at Solvang, it would be Paula's Pancake House. I give this place an ""Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this"" rating. We came for the food, but stayed for the experience. Eat well and prosper,",5 star rating,Bryan W.

We got the mimosa for 2. I love that they give you a bottle of champagne so you decide how much or little of champagne you want in your drink,5 star rating,Kay G.
8/31/2016,"San Diego, CA","There was an hour wait here, so we put our name down and walked around this cute little town. I was determined to get the Danish pancakes since I never tried them before and they look so good in all the photos too! When we were seated, we ordered a bottle of champagne and a large orange juice to make our own mimosas.I ordered Paula's special, which were Danish pancakes topped with your choice of cinnamon apples, blueberries, or strawberries, and whipped cream. I chose the fresh strawberries and added a side of Danish sausage. My friends ordered the California omelette, the Danish pancake combo, and rib eye and eggs. The pancakes were so good! It was really thin and tasted like a crepe. I really liked the sausage too- it wasn't too fatty or greasy at all. The omelette and steak were just okay to me. Service wasn't that great.... We were never given our waters, so we had to ask again halfway through brunch. Our server also forgot a few items, but it seemed like she was doing her best though. I wouldn't mind coming back to get more pancakes if I ever visit Solvang again.",4 star rating,Dung N.

Either way, we won't return.When we were seated early for breakfast (read: it wasn't packed), no one asked if we wanted drinks. We kept flagging down people to take our order and our waitress kept saying she'd return. Instead we watched other people get their drinks and orders taken. Meanwhile we were sitting there ignored. We were honestly about to leave when she finally came around. We had to keep asking for service, like a coffee refill. She never came to ask how the food was either. Not saying that the table right next to us had better service cause they were white or anything, but all I know is they seemed to have no trouble getting her attention whenever they needed her.The food was okay.",2 star rating,Elle C.

Fast service too.",5 star rating,Bernard M.
12/31/2016,"Orange, CA","This place is famous for its Danish pancakes, but I think everything else is otherwise quite ordinary. The wait is also incredibly long, so you have to come at the right time. Pancakes: These are thin, wide pancakes that taste kind of like crepes. They come in two with lightly powdered sugar on top. They're quite fluffy despite being so thin. I really enjoyed them and wish I had more! They come with hashbrown or fruit, and I got hash browns even though I wanted fruit, which was unfortunately lucky. The fruits on other pieces were a little too soft and mushy.Omelette: I got the ham and cheese omelette, which wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredibly special. I was a little disappointed at the lack of even distribution in the ham and cheese. Steak: My mother had the tri-tip steak, and she complained that it had been too stiff and not well flavored, though she did ask for well done. She said the meat was a little too dry. Eggs Florentine: My brother and father shared this and enjoyed it. The Hollidaine sauce was well done and given generously. The eggs were well done with the gooey texture bursting out with a bite. Overall, this is a place for pancakes, so if you wanted to come here, get the pancakes. The other items are nothing too crazy.",3 star rating,Nita C.

4/17/2017,"La Puente, CA","So nice I came here twice. Really though, we (my girlfriend, mom, and I) were in Solvang for a weekend and we enjoyed it so much the first day that we came back for breakfast on the second day. The first thing you will notice is that there is usually a wait. For us, it ended up being 30-45 minutes each time. Par for the course... I imagine it'd be less if you show up really early, i.e. before 9:00 AM.I did not catch the hostess' name, but she was really nice. She actually remembered me when we came back the second day. The servers were great - very attentive. They took care of anything we asked for quickly. The food tastes great. They had a good variety of options to choose from, ranging between standard American breakfast food and some Danish foods for the daring. The restaurant itself is nothing too fancy. Slightly better than an IHOP, but it's not a trendy restaurant by any means. Inside, it can get a little loud because there are so many people, but nothing raucous like some breakfast places I have been to. You can sit indoors (preferable most days) or outdoors if the weather is nice enough. All in all, Paula's is a great way to begin your day when in Solvang. For us, it was especially convenient because we stayed at a hotel that was within walking distance. Parking was not an issue. The lot did seem fairly small, so be warned about that.",5 star rating,Christian G.

The place was very cute and had a vintage feel to it and the customer service was great. Very welcoming and nice. It was pretty busy when we came on a tuesday morning but didn't have to wait long at all.The danish pancake were so light, thin but still fluffy the strawberries were lightly sweetened but not too much where it would make the pancakes too sweet.

We waited 10 - 15 minutes when we went around 8:00 am. Our friends went later and had to wait 60 minutes.* The thin pancakes are NOT crepes, but they are delicious :) Highly recommended.* Everything we tried was very yummy. * Good portions* Good service* Fun, laid-back atmosphere* Outdoor seating is very cute; if it's full, try for a seat right by the windows inside and you get the best of both worlds.",4 star rating,Alex G.

8/25/2016,"Riverside, CA","My family and I came to Solvang as a quick pit stop before heading to Norcal. We decided to walk into this place as a result and I do not regret it! When I checked into yelp, turns out this place was a famous pancake house! We ordered Paula's special since it seemed like the ideal thing to order as a first timer. We picked the strawberry and blueberry toppings. The pancakes were huge and very crepe like as it was thin yet fluffy. They were really big and can fill a person or two. The strawberry was my personal favorite. The strawberries are very fresh and very sweet and complimented the pancakes well. The blueberry one was good as well but compared to the strawberry one, it was a bit sour.  I saw a huge orange juicer which tells me their juice is super fresh and I will come try that next . This time I had their coffee and that was still really fresh and warm and just plain delightful! Service is good here, there is always someone checking up and making sure you are enjoying your meal. The atmosphere is also very homey and warm. This is a good place to take family and friends for breakfast or brunch. I've also been reading many reviews that this place has super long lines... and I'm not surprised. My family arrived to this lovely place 8:00 am on a Friday morning and there were only a few customers inside. So I guess for less wait, come earlier!When I have a chance to come back up north, I will try their other menu items.",4 star rating,Sarina L.
1/22/2017,"San Diego, CA",Probably the most famous place in the cute little town of Solvang ;)We came here during the holiday season and were greeted with a huge line which seems to be a common sight at this place. Host/Hostess gave us somewhat an accurate description of the wait time of approx 45-55 mins (yes you read it right). Once we got our tables we started getting our orders pretty quickly although they did miss all substitutions and special requests. Coffee was European style and OJ was fresh just what you expect from a good breakfast place. The standout star here however are the danish pancakes with fresh strawberries (highly recommended) they were made to perfection being not to sweet and light just like crepes. Other items did seem pretty average.,4 star rating,Charvi N.

Ordered the Danish pancakes with strawberries (I've never finished a full plate - I'm not a sweets person but the reviews convinced me - and I devoured my plate!) and my husband got the Benedict with corned beef hash.

4/26/2019,"Huntington Beach, CA",Had breakfast on a Wednesday. Sat outside under umbrellas. Weather was good for that. Furniture was plastic furniture. Inside was tight. Only two individual bathrooms. Eggs Benedict was good. Paula's combo was ok. It came with danish pancake versus American pancakes. Danish pancakes are thinner.

6/3/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","If you're visiting Solvang for the first time and enjoy breakfast food, Paula's Pancake House is a must stop. I've only been here a couple times and know a few things: (1) If you have a sweet tooth, order the Paula's Special. I ordered my Danish Pancakes with Fresh Strawberries and whipped cream. You can also opt for Warm Cinnamon Apples or Blueberries. Danish Pancakes are basically thin pancakes, like the in-between of crepes and pancakes.(2) For the savory eater, order the Solvang Danish-Style Sausage and Eggs. (3) Long wait during prime-time (11a-2p). We waited 1 hour for 2 people when we came last weekend at 12p. (4) During your wait, go next door to Olsen's Danish Village Bakery and grab a bucket of assorted Danish cookies and an Almond Kringle. I should have bought more.

Get your name on the list and stroll around , but make sure you come back a little before hand to make sure they don't give away your spot.The girls at the front could be more organized.

10/30/2017,"Oakland, CA","TL/DR: great portions, nice outdoor seating, friendly serviceI wanted that immersive Denmark experience since I was visiting Solvang, and this place popped up on Google Maps as a ""must-try"" experience. The restaurant was very cute, and the servers were all dressed up. There was no line on a Wednesday morning, and the weather was perfect for outdoor seating. Love:1. Danish pancakes were on point! It was crispy on the edges, soft and spongy in the middle, and absorbs syrup super well. The batter wasn't too salty. 2. They have an option to shrink your portion in half, and get $1.50 off. Definitely helps people like me who have a small appetite. Like1. Server was very nice, and checked in appropriately. She was handling a lot of other tables, but she was on point!2. The eggs benedict was pretty standard. I personally don't like smoked salmon, but it was very fishy so I assume it's good for those that like itMeh:1. I didn't sit inside because the interior and furniture looked really old. It also felt kind of cheap that the outdoor chairs were plastic. 2. Personally not a fan of the Danish sausage. I tried it because I was curious, and I didn't like the after taste. 3. Their coffee was watery. Didn't want refills after awhile. Food: 4/5Location: 5/5Service: 5/5The pancakes reminded me of the 49ers flapjacks from the Original Pancake House in Anaheim, but smaller in size and less salty. I prefer the ones here at Paula's, and I highly recommend them. I saw a parking lot across the street from Paula's, and it looked like it was free parking. Not really sure because Solvang is a tourist town so not a lot of people drive. If you're staying at a hotel, I would leave the car at the hotel parking lot and walk around the town because it's super small and everything is close to each other.",4 star rating,Irene P.

1/15/2016,"Santa Rosa, CA","Is it worth waiting close to 60 minutes for weekend brunch here? I'll let you be the judge of that. My friends and I visited here on a Sunday 10 am because of the many good things we have heard about Paula's. After the exhausting wait, our name was finally called and we were seated at a table inside. After examining the entire menu, I elected to order the Danish Pancake Combo because Paula's is famous for their Danish Pancakes ($10.25). If you have never had a Danish pancake, it tastes and resembles like a crepe. I am not the biggest crepe fanatic, so I thought the Danish pancake was okay. The two eggs and bacon that accompanied the pancakes were ordinary. The bacon was not very crispy. My friend ordered the California Omelette and said it was delicious. I expected something mind blowing to come outta Paula's especially after all the raving reviews. Aside from the Danish Pancakes, I don't know if anything here is worth waiting an hour for. There are more comparable breakfast options in Lompoc without the wait.",3 star rating,Philip M.
9/18/2016,"Lake Forest, CA","Long lines on weekend mornings should not deter you; wait them out - you'll be glad you did. Paula's does not take reservations, even for large groups and all party members must be present to be seated so you've got to plan to either be there when they open or plan on hanging out for a while and get to know some other patrons.Danish pancakes are the specialty and everyone should try them at least once, but you'll want to come back often enough so that you can try many other items. Danish pancakes can be ordered with butter and maple syrup or you can choose fruit and whipped cream.  Both options are good. You can also get them in a combination with eggs and bacon, sausage or ham (extra charge for ham). They also offer buttermilk pancakes which are pretty good - thick, good-sized, and golden brown, but the taste was not exceptional, just good.The eggs benedict is a good choice, with the eggs poached to order, a delicious lemony hollandaise sauce, and an olive on each half.My son advised that the waffle was very tasty.  Everyone found the coffee to be delightful and the freshly squeezed orange juice should not be overlooked on the menu.Server seemed a bit stern at first, but seemed to warm up to our large group (11) after a bit. Prices are somewhat higher than the same menu items at other local restaurants, but I'm not sure the quality is up there with Paula's.",4 star rating,Carlene P.

The combination plate came with 2 pancakes, Dutch sausage and 2 eggs. The Dutch sausage is super good. I love it so much I bought 2 lbs frozen to go! The pancakes were light so even though they give you 2 big ones, it didn't leave you weighed down.The boyfriend got the omelette and really enjoyed it, plump and fluffy.

11/28/2017,"Anaheim, CA","Typically, a 45 minute-2 hour wait for breakfast- absolutely not. However, when driving all the way from Long Beach, to specifically have these pancakes- you wait. We were here around 10:40 am on a Saturday, and for a group of 4, we got seated in about 40 minutes. It's definitely cramped seating, in that they want to facilitate as many people as possible, as they know their pancakes are in high demand. Tables, outside at least, are very close together. I can confidently say, all of the food, is AMAZING. Very fresh, surprisingly light tasting- even for ""heartier"" foods. My sister ordered the corned beef Benedict, and it made me want to instantly change my order. Pancakes are, just, heavenly. Dessert did breakfast. You have the option to order it plain, with powdered sugar, or with a fruit topping. Best bets to order an actual drinking, rather than ask for water.

My friend and I ordered only one order of these since both of us lean more towards savory food for breakfast...but we really liked these and I found myself wishing I ordered another one. But these pancakes are thin and easy to eat, not trying to suffocate you...that's not to say that they are not fluffy...they were. They were somewhat of a cross between crepes and pancakes!I also got their cottage cheese and buttermilk. That was a probably a little too much dairy for me but I didn't realize while ordering. I'm a little eccentric when it comes to mixing my foods so I added hot sauce to both my cottage cheese and the buttermilk and it tasted better!We went around 10/10:30 and had a wait time of about 30-40 minutes so we decided to walk around after putting our names down. We headed over to Succulent since we were pretty ravenous. We did want to save space in our tummy for Paula's pancakes too so we didn't order too much there and just headed back to Paula's to find that our name had already been called. They were still very nice and accommodating and let us know that the next open outdoor table was ours. Their outdoor seating is gorgeous btw!",5 star rating,Kavya T.

7/18/2018,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA","My party was immediately seated in the outdoor patio area and our orders were taken about 10 minutes after being seated. Paula's Special with strawberries was light and fluffy but a little dry so it definitely needed some syrup. The pastry itself was large but not very filling. Still a great choice if you're trying Paula's for the first time. The Irish Benedict was fantastic! Hash browns were just a tad undercooked but the biscuit and egg were savory and the beef hash was on point. It was a better experience than last time and I'm still a bit disappointed that the system they use for the wait list is just a piece of lined paper. Overall, the food is nice for something quick to hold you over until you sit down for a bigger meal later in the day.",4 star rating,Gia N.

Showed up, put down our names (willing to take any seating -- inside, outside, bar)... still a one hour wait to seat 3 people.While we debated sticking around, we saw the food coming out and being served to the patio seating... and it looked extremely average. Nothing special whatsoever.So we looked across the street and saw a sign for breakfast at a little place right there (La Sirenita)... so we headed over there, and it was good! Immediate seating, good variety of American, Danish, and Mexican foods (omelettes, eggs benedict, huevos rancheros, Danish crepes and aebelskiver, etc)Don't bother with Paula's... there are other options",1 star rating,Matthew G.

We asked what the wait time was and they advised 35 minutes but that's after we agreed to whatever was first available- counter, inside or outside. The wait time was about right and we ended up at the counter.Our server was busy which is understandable. There wasn't much interaction but that's fine she was there when we needed her, got our order right, and didn't make us wait.We got the Classic Benedict ($11), the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs ($10), and the mimosas for two ($10). The food came out quickly. It tasted fine with no complaints or noteworthy comments. Overall, it's a breakfast option. If we're in the area and wanted breakfast we might stop by again if the waits less then 15 minutes.",3 star rating,Lauren S.

1/3/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","My friends and I stopped by because this place was recommended to me by a friend and also super popular on yelp. After eating here I definitely understand why. All three of us tried the danish pancakes, which were awesome; thin but fluffy with crispy edges, and delicious light syrup to top it off. The strawberries on mine were sweet and noticeably fresh. My eggs over medium needed a dash of salt but were cooked perfectly. I ordered fresh squeezed OJ which is a guilty pleasure of mine. It was delicious but the regular size is a bit small- looking back I'd splurge on the bigger size for another dollar. The service was very prompt and friendly, especially since on-and-off rain had everyone acting crazy; tables would abandon their spots and move other places without asking, which was a little hectic, but the waitresses (give them a break guys!) took it in stride and tried to help us best they could to avoid getting us rained on. When our table was sorted, our order was taken quickly and our food arrived just as quickly. I appreciated the attention given to us by the waitress who seemed experienced and on top of her stuff. Lunch did run us about twenty dollars per person, which was more than I'd usually like to spend on a pancake breakfast, but I can't deny that everything about our meal was spot on and worth the money. Would come back, and soon!",5 star rating,Irene R.

8/13/2017,"Santa Clarita, CA","Greetings,Please keep in mind this place is always packed but it was well worth the wait. You will experience some of the most amazing breakfast place this little German town has to offer. They are famous for the Belgian waffle with just lightly coated with butter but so fluffy and airy it melts in your mouth you must order more than one. Also the German sausage upgrade over the regular sausage was well worth it you get double the meat size and a unique flavor that reminds you of Europe. So if you're in Solvang and looking for a breakfast place look no further than Paula's pancake house.Once you're done with breakfast there's a cute boutique store located right next-door to Paula's where you can find all sorts of a little necklaces, beads and European knickknacks.

I know it can get busy, but it is a tourist down and if you are here during tourist season, don't expect to get right in anywhere worth getting into.The service is good and they keep your coffee topped all the time. The breakfast menu is diverse and has some unique and tasty stuff. You can also find some traditional fare if that is your preference. For Solvang, this is pretty reasonable and a good value.

9/20/2018,"Colorado Springs, CO","My husband and I checked this place out only because I got to talk to the owner who happened to be buying strawberries at a farm stand in Lompoc. If the owner takes pride in buying local fresh produce, I'm def going to check their business out! We went on a Thursday morning and it wasn't busy. The first thing you notice are the servers in their cute white and blue outfits -totally setting the Danish theme. And as soon as we were seated, we were offered coffee. Speedy service! I have to say Leia, our server made up for our whole experience. While the English muffin on the side was tasty, their ""freshly baked biscuit"" was not. It tasted at least a day old and my husband commented he had better. I ordered one of the specials of the day -eggs and sirloin steak. I asked for a medium cooked steak and I got well done. Not only was it fully cooked, it tasted OLD. It had a horrible off-taste. Leia was quick to fix the situation and I got the steak I originally ordered. My sunny side eggs were also half raw. Seriously, what's the chef's deal? I should have gotten the scrambled eggs like my husband to be safe. And the hash browns, we've had better. We honestly don't understand why this place is so popular. It wasn't a full house on a Thursday morning. The only explanation would be the tourists. We don't see how any of the locals would be returning customers unless they go for a bowl of fruit. We wanted to like this place. We really did. It was average to say the least, according to my husband. The only highlight was our server. She deserves a raise. We won't be going back. Plenty of other fabulous restaurants in Solvang to go to.",3 star rating,Angela R.
9/27/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was quite ridiculous. They definitely make it a point to try to turn people away when you put your name down. I guess I can't blame them with the amount of customers asking how long the wait will be, but the whole interaction just made me uncomfortable.Me: Hi, we have a party of 2.Hostess: The wait is 1.5-2 hrs.Me: Oh my gosh, ok. Do you guys do any to-go orders for pastries or something we can purchase to snack on?Hostess: No, you have to wait for your turn to order food.Me: So you guys don't do to-go orders?Hostess: You can go inside to see if they will take your order. Are you going to put your name down or leave?Me: Um.. ok, we'll put our name down first.My boyfiend: Do you guys sell any pastries?Hostess: There is a bakery next door.What a confusing conversation. We put our name down, go to the bakery to buy some snacks, and literally not even after 15 minutes, the hostess calls our name. Why would you tell someone it's an hour wait when it's obviously not, and why wouldn't you have just told me there was a bakery next door in the first place? The food itself was good, but nothing spectacular. The Danish pancake was a sight to see, but super thin and crepe-like, and just plain not satisfying or filling. My boyfriend's omelette was alright, nothing to write home about. I guess I was expecting something special, but there are way too many delicious brunch places in LA to get excited about this. If you're in the area, I'd look elsewhere to be impressed.",3 star rating,Debbie O.

Hash browns has absolutely no taste, sausage I couldn't eat at all - really bad. Service is horrible. I had to stand up and look for my server to get a coffee refill. I asked for extra milk and got it 20 minuets after. They all ignore you, even if you sit and waive. We end up spending over $100 for breakfast that we didn't liked and still tip %20 just because we are nice people. But none of us are coming back and I don't think that they care at all.

They didn't offer outdoor eatery and just assumed we only wanted indoor eatery and asked us to sign in. After waiting, we noticed people walking outside to seat themselves so we asked if that was an option. It was. We sat ourselves outdoors which was nice and the area quickly filled up. Waitress finally arrived only to say, ""I don't know who's first"" as she stood in confusion. I immediately told her, ""we were"" as we've been waiting longer to be seated so felt it was only right. Next thing you know she just randomly took everyone's order. That's ok, nothing to bitch about. We're here to enjoy ourselves.

Definitely nothing to write home about. The biscuits were equivalent to biting into a mound of flour and their jam/preserves tastes like sad plastic. The staff looked super miserable.

7/13/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Went on a day trip to Solvang with the fiance and due to high ratings (and because it's one of the most reviewed), we decided to grab brunch at Paula's. Wouldn't claim it's the best place for breakfast/brunch in Solvang but I've been to the Belgian Cafe before and I'd have to say, I prefer Paula's. I had the Paula's Special with strawberries and I really like how their pancakes are pretty much crepe-like. Not to mention, the whole thing smells so heavenly and homey it gives you that fuzzy feeling. Oh, and looove the syrup too. Fiance had the pastrami with Swiss cheese and it's just average. I also didn't like the coleslaw that comes with it, it's a little bitter for my taste. We also shared the bacon and cheddar cheese omelette with hashbrowns. It's decent, I mean anything with bacon will always come out a winner, but there's nothing really special with this one. They specialize in pancakes (hence, Paula's Pancakes) so I think just stick with that and you're alright. Service was a miss. As soon as we got to the hostess, there was no greeting at all. She just asked us how many were in our party and if we wanted counter or outdoor seating...there might be an extra charge for a ""good morning"", I guess. Our waitress, on the other hand, was pleasant but she didnt really check if we needed anything throughout our meal and since our table was at the back corner of their outdoor area, it was hard to get her attention. I didn't bother asking for a refill of my drink. Wait wasn't too bad. We went on a weekday and had to wait for less than 10 minutes for a table. 3.5 stars.",3 star rating,Jade P.

9/10/2018,"Encino, CA","Stopped here for breakfast. Very quaint. We've been wanting to stop here for years but it's usually packed on weekends and tourist season. Value for money is really good. Quality of food is great. I had pancakes and two eggs. Their home made sausage is very good, if not excellent. Only giving four stars because for a pancake house they're miserly on the butter and syrup, yet had jam jars on the table. This made for half dry pancakes, and I left the dry half. No refill on my water.  All in all, nice place. Glad we stopped.",4 star rating,Connie H.

12/6/2015,"Fairfield, CA","WHAT an awesome place (thanks Yelp good call!)...WHY I GAVE it FIVE STARS (read below)So finally visited Solvang, and this was the place for a great Danish Breakfast...We had our dog Jerry with us, but since they had an outside area figured it might be okay.  So asked the hostess, and she stated normally if it's busy they don't, but since we came on a weekday during fall/winter there was no one brave enough for the cold (although I don't think it was below 60, for cali that's freezing haha)The hostess seated us in the corner (with Jerry), and turned on the heat lamp and was very friendlySERVICE: EXCELLENT ,besides our fantastic hostess hooking us up with Jerry.  Our waitress who I don't remember her name, but she was VERY SWEET...and really cute dressed in the Danish garb...felt bad making her go out in the cold, but she says it was fine.  She kept checking on our coffee and water...Food: Great Danish Food (okay I'm not danish but if I thought how Danish food should taste like it seemed close..whatever, it tasted good...Ordered the Danish Pancake combo with the Danish Sausage and my husband ordered the corn beef hash.Now to state why I gave 5 stars...we really enjoyed the sausages which had a mild onion and other seasonings  that was really yummy without being oily or salty like other sausages... So much so my husband wanted to bring some back for a repeat of our SOLVANG breakfast.  So he order 25lbs...and the waitress was able to pack it for us (cause we live in the bay area) in a costco bucket with ICE...SO NICE!!!  Definitely worth a 5 star review.  No extra charges...Brought back the sausages and had some for breakfast...equally yummy....will definitely be returning here.Also they had great Farmer Brother's coffee.  Come here for a wonderful Danish breakfast you won't be disappointed!",5 star rating,Elaine R.

So we went to the bakery next door to buy some goodies. By the time we came back, the hostess told us our table was ready. We had a table outside and it was a nice warm day. I wanted to try the danish pancakes and my bf got the bacon and eggs dish. The danish pancakes are thinner than the buttermilk ones. It's kind of like a crepe. The outer parts were crispy and the middle was softer. It was good but not crazy amazing. The bacon and eggs dish was also your average bacon and eggs. It was also good but not amazing. From reading the reviews, I expected so much more. This place is pretty much a typical breakfast place but with danish pancakes. Don't get me wrong, it was good. I would've just rated it 3 stars but an extra star for the quick service and affordable prices!",4 star rating,Kim N.

The menu is fairly robust and seems to offer most of what anyone might want.  I ordered bacon, eggs, and hash browns - the standard default.  Nothing was exceptional, but nothing was bad either.  It was a solid middle of the road breakfast.  I will say I noticed quality control might be a little low as portions seemed to vary plate by plate.  My wife had the Danish pancakes and those were surprisingly good.  If you're in the mood for something sweeter, give it a try.  It seems to be one of the more unique items they offer.Come here with modest expectations and you'll be fine.  I'd have no problem stopping here again.  I like this quick and simple places - you pretty much know what you're going to get.",3 star rating,Joey D.
8/22/2017,"Glendale, CA","We were on a mission to beat the breakfast rush. Sunday morning, 6am, Memorial Day Weekend. One other person in the restaurant. Mission accomplished. We wanted to try what everyone else raves about, so we got Danish pancakes and then a large stack of buttermilk pancakes with chopped pecans. The Danish pancakes were good, slightly sweet. The buttermilk pancakes with pecans were fluffy and filling. They have an amazingly huge juicing machine, and it became a game to watch the oranges tumble down the chute. If you're not a pancake person, might not be your best breakfast bet, but if you happen to be awake and hungry at 6am, it'd be a good start to the day.",3 star rating,Becky B.

The muffin on for the Irish Benedict was nice and crispy, which is a nice contrast to other egg benedict dishes I have had. The Danish pancakes were a nice surprise because I usually don't like pancakes, and now I know why: they're too thick!

4/11/2015,"London, United Kingdom","Paula's is nothing short of five stars. We got there before 9am and there was no wait for a table outside (it helped that the sub hadn't quite hit the patio, so people were waiting for tables inside). We were greeted and seated right away. Coffee came instantly with the menus. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash and I ordered two simple Danish pancakes. The patio was crowded but we sat under an awning of flowers/plants and it was very romantic and private (even though it wasn't). Although the restaurant was packed, the service was top notch. Our coffee cups were always full and our food came fairly fast after we ordered. Though this restaurant is mad dashing to turn tables, the food is very tasty and made to perfection. My boyfriend's corn beef hash were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, the eggs were soft and the potatoes weren't overcooked. My pancakes came with whipped cream and syrup. They were thin and fluffy and the whipped cream was real whipped cream, it was sweet, and thick I didn't even need/use the syrup. Our coffees kept getting refilled, our server was friendly and on top of her game and we even got a refill of coffee to go.Street parking.Arrive early or be prepared to spend quite a bit of your morning waiting for a table.Prices were very fair compared to other restaurants in town.

Instead of using regular syrup I opted to slather them in the homemade jam. The strawberry jam was so good we took some home!The hash browns and bacon were perfectly crispy. I love when I order bacon extra crispy and it comes out perfect! We also tried the homemade sausage which was very flavorful.

Don't get the tuna melt haha, that's my fault since they are called a pancake house not a tuna melt house! Their danish pancakes were wide but very flat. Good but didn't taste like anything special or memorable. The bacon was pretty bomb though but then again, I just like bacon! The hot chocolate had homemade whip in it which is a plus! The wait is long though so always expect 30-45 mins if you have some where to be. Prices are average for your typical breakfast joint. There's also only one bathroom per gender which can result in a long wait so try to go elsewhere if you can!",3 star rating,Vivian N.

All gone. My favorite was the chicken fried steak.  I have been looking forward to trying the pancakes here since we planned this trip months ago, but the chicken fried steak was definitely the stand out of everything we ordered.  In all fairness to the pancakes, we just had danishes from next door at Olsen's Bakery in anticipation of a long wait, so I wasn't all that hungry when we actually sat down to eat at Paula's. Show up hungry and order just as we did. Quite possibly one of the best breakfasts, if you're into gluttonous pancakes and protein.  If you eat on the lighter side, this is not a place for you.

12/20/2016,"Chino, CA","This place is waaaaay overhyped!! We waited over an hour to eat at this place... and we felt like leaving the moment we sat down. We came at noon and we not seated until after 1pm. Upon sitting down, our waitress seemed immediately unhappy to be there and in ""lala"" land. She asked us what we wanted to drink. We said just water for now and my friend ordered a cup of coffee too. ... the waitress brought out the coffee, JUST the coffee and was like ""anything else?"". ...ummm... we also asked for water... She brings out ONE glass of water for the 3 of us and again goes ""what else""... we're like, we all ordered a water... she goes oh okay. My friend also asks for a glass of orange juice for her daughter. The waitress says okay. In what felt like an eternity, seriously, I saw her bringing plates to other people and taking orders, going in/out, walking back and forth... and a long long while later, she finally brings the other waters... but NO orange juice and asks if we are ready to order. At that point, we honestly felt like getting up to leave to eat somewhere else. What type of service is this?!? Seriously, you can't even bring out water and juice when we ask? WTF?? However, since we waited an hour already just to be seated, we wanted to try this place at least. So we ordered. I had steak and eggs... and it was NOT good. The steak was tiny and tasteless!! It had zero flavor!! I had to add so much pepper and mix it with the eggs and all to get some sort of flavor. My friend ordered the omelette and we had waffles to share. We did not order the danish pancakes because my friend wanted to try the waffles first and come back to try the pancakes the following day. Ordering both would be too much food. I do not recommend anything we ordered. Nothing was good. Nothing was worth an hour wait. The food also took a really long time to come out also!! It took at least 30 minutes!! Our waitress NEVER checked on us after, but we saw her checking up on other tables... After this, we were like forget the pancakes, we're never coming back to this place. Service at this place we absent and dismal, outright appalling!! Prices were fair... but since the food was terrible, it was NOT worth the price. If there is a wait, skip it and go somewhere else to eat. Bad food and bad service is not worth waiting an hour for!! I really wanted to like this place too.

12/29/2014,"San Gabriel, CA","Congratulation Paula's Pancake House, you have officially won 2014 Slowest Service of the Year award (approximately 45 minutes from the moment we sat down to the 1st delivery of food). Unfortunately, your subpar pancake and annoying flies didn't help either.For some miraculous reasons, I actually sat through the first 20 minutes at the counter seats and saw two separate groups just snapped and walked away. The first group left due to multiple buzzing flies and the second group left due to extremely slow and non-attentive service (the dude didn't even pay for his iced tea). Now the guy who sat right next to me requested to move from counter seats to table seats - well ... the request was denied.In the end, one of the young waitresses (who dressed in traditional blue Danish clothing) finally took our orders. And my goodness, I sat through ANOTHER 20 minutes before the food actually come out.---Danish Pancakes filled and topped with sliced Danish Sausage ($9.25): Not so good - overpriced bland pancakes stuffed with passable / average Danish sausage. (2/5)Light Lunch - Cup of Homemade Soup + Chicken Salad Served on Whole Grain Wheat Bread ($8.75): Ask yourself this question - would you pay almost $9 for a dry and boring chicken salad sandwich with a cup of tasteless soup (see picture below)? Don't get it. (1/5) A cup of orange juice: Freshly squeezed OJ, but more sour than I expected. (3/5) ---And after I was told to pay at the front entrance, cashier asked me whether everything was good.""Pretty good, but service was a bit slow."" I replied.She just simply stated that most restaurants are closed on the Christmas Eve and today was busier than usual. Well if you are going to give up service in exchange for opening on the Christmas Eve, then I would rather have you close the restaurant on the Christmas Eve instead.Personally, I would skip this restaurant due to their lackluster service and pretty ripped off pancakes.",1 star rating,Luke L.

The mix for the pancake tasted like cake and didn't need fruit or all of the maple syrup that's served on the side. There's powdered sugar on top and this along with some light butter on the pancake will change your views on pancakes if you aren't a big fan. There's seating indoor and in the patio. Both are served by waitresses in cute danish outfits. This restaurant is located next to a bakery so if there is a wait, at least you have an option of getting a quick bite next door.

Man, did I see the greatness dor myself!! The waitlist was about 20 minutes on a busy sunday morning. We easily found parking nearby and the wait was not bad at all! We sat in the front patio, and it had heaters in case it got chilly. The service was so great!!!The wait staff's outfits were very fitting for the town vibe. Qhen we sat down we were attended to immediately. We asked for the large bottle of mimosas, and it was enough for 2 to 3 people. The mimosas had very good quality smoothe champagne, and came with delicious, fresh squeezed orange juice.  I also got the Paula's special with a side of hashbrowns. The hash browns were very tasty and perfectly crunchy. Paula's special consisted of 2 light danish pancakes with fresh cinnamon apples and topped with whipe cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. They were amazing, light and oh so tasty!!! I would definitely recommend!!!! I ate them quickly and hated when there was no more left. I'd love to go back and trt more of their menu items.

So I turned to my favorite app and searched for the #1 breakfast spot and Paula's popped up. We got there around 8:45 and it seemed busy but we put our names in and was told the wait was 20 minutes but we were seated in less time than estimated. We were seated at the counter (we said it was okay to sit there you can ask for a table instead). Service was quick. We bother ordered the danish combination with danish pancakes, eggs, and sausage or bacon. Out waitress asked us if we wanted to too our pancakes with whip cream and fruit. Again service was quick and we received our food pretty fast. The portions were big and everything tasted pretty fresh. Although I didn't know it at the time, our waitress didnt mention it, the whip cream and the fresh fruit was an extra charge which brought our meals to 15 dollars each.. kind of bummed that we weren't warned about that but it was good so I let it go.",4 star rating,Kristin D.

3/31/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Service: 5 | Food: 3 I think the only reason why this is the most popular place in Solvang is because it's a self perpetuating the cycle. I think everyone that comes as a tourist and does exactly the same thing- looks on yelp for the highest rated. But it's not truly a four star and I doubt that it's the best breakfast place in solving. It's certainly not worth the hour plus wait that you can expect on a holiday or weekend.The service is good though. They are used to dealing with big groups of people who are hungry and tired of waiting. Our waitress dealt with our party of 13 well. If you do each year, the food to get is obviously Pollis pancakes. The eggs and hashbrowns are very regular to below average.",3 star rating,Nikki S.
5/27/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",Great place to eat with really good food. The Danish pancakes were soft and and delicious. My friend and I ate here and shared everything. The Danish sausages they had we cooked to perfection. I got the rib eye steak and eggs which in my opinion was a great price for 15$ you get a lot of food (consisting of biscuit hash and eggs) that come with the steak. Get there early and put your name down. My group got there at 12 and had to wait 1.5 hours. You can go sightseeing while waiting or visit the near by batteries to pass the time. There is also a brewery next door.,5 star rating,Hong H.
10/27/2014,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA","My father used to work for Michael Jackson as his head-of-security in the 90's up at Neverland Ranch and so I used to live in Solvang, Ca. That's how I stumbled across the best pancakes I've ever had in life that come from Paula's Pancake House, the Danish eatery in the Danish town of Solvang, Ca. Let me repeat myself THESE ARE THE BEST PANCAKES EVER in life. I've tried pancakes from probably 500+ different places during the course of my life and This. Is. The. Best.=========LOCATION=========Located in Solvang, Callifornia... Solvang is a small tourist down that is completely Danish. The stores, buildings, etc are all of Danish design and the city itself is a popular tourist spot, about 45 minutes north of Santa Barbara.The place itself is on Main St. in the heart of the small 7 block town. There's ample in-door seating, a large out door patio on Mission St. (the main street of the down) ...and the entire interior and exterior of the restaurant is of Danish architecture.The waitresses are all dressed in cute Danish attire, short fluffy dresses, like something you'd see at a German Oktoberfest.=========THE FOOD=========~ STRAWBERRY DANISH PANCAKES - Like I said, these are THE BEST pancakes ever. Danish pancakes are thinner than normal pancakes, sprinkled with powdered sugar, topped with whipped cream and are simply divine. The also have traditional Buttermilk Pancakes but go with the Danish ones. The Strawberry variety is their best. (5/5)~ BELGIAN WAFFLE - Even those their Belgian and not Danish, these waffles were amazing. I know they're known for their pancakes but their Waffles are among the best I've ever had. (5/5)yelp.com/user_local_phot…~ MIMOSAS - They give you a small pitcher of Orange Juice and a small bottle of champagne so you can do it yourself / adjust how much champagne is in it. It's a mimosa so of course it's a (5/5)~ APPLE CINNAMON DANISH PANCAKE - It was pretty good and is probably a solid (5) but I'm knocking it down a peg because it's ""almost"" as good as their Strawberry one. (5/5)yelp.com/user_local_phot…~ CHEESEBURGER - I came here with my brother once and he wasn't in a breakfast mood and being the teenager that he is, he ordered a burger. Surprisingly it was very good. (4/5)~ SCRAMBLED EGGS - Most of their breakfast orders come with eggs. I had mine scrambled... paid extra to add in cheese and mushroom. It was good, not great. (3/5)~ DANISH STYLE SAUSAGE - You get a choice of bacon or sausage. Go bacon, this sausage tasted unpleasant both times I've had it. Do not order it. Avoid it like Ebola! (1/5)===============FINAL THOUGHTS===============Whenever I visit Solvang, whether for nostalgia, on a romantic date, or with family I swing by here. Danish Pancakes from here are the Holy Grail. There's usually a huge line on weekends and you're looking at a 1+ hour wait on weekend mornings. Every time I've gone I've sat outside and I love the fresh air and seating outside. yelp.com/biz_photos/paul…As a personal tip... the last time I went my pancakes were a little too soft so you might want to ask them to make the pancakes a little crispy/ier.Get the ""Paula's Combination"", which is Danish Pancakes + 2 Eggs + Bacon/Sausage. Also ask for Jam and they'll bring it fresh to your table...yelp.com/biz_photos/paul…Do yourself a favor, the next time you're in Santa Barbara or driving to San Francisco or central California, swing by and taste greatness.",5 star rating,Shaun W.

The atmosphere is wonderful and I would definitely come again!,4 star rating,Greg W.
3/13/2017,"Oakland, CA","This cute spot is worth the visit if you are ever in Solvang for some tasty crepe-like Danish Pancakes with a huge pile of fresh strawberries and whipped cream, with a classic maple syrup.  It's not the best breakfast I've ever had, but it was perfect for what I was looking for on a leisurely Sunday.  Service is friendly even though they are so slammed with long waits, and it takes a little longer to get the waiter/waitress's attention.  Nonetheless, they were very nice and came back quickly with each request.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was quite refreshing and just the right balance of sour and sweet.Outside seating is much easier to get with less of a wait, just try to get there before 9:00 AM.",4 star rating,Tu-Quyen P.
7/6/2015,"Huntington Beach, CA","It's decently good but pricey for just pancakes and a sausage. About $11 with tax and tip, you're looking at $14 for a simple breakfast. Everything on the menu is simple and pricy. It seems like only tourists come here. The pancakes were thin and buttery. The sausage was seasoned well.They are busy so have someone checks in while you park.Half of the seatings are outdoors and they keep the door opens....so you get lots of flies. Not fun while batting off flies and enjoying your food. Inside is crowed and a bit dingy. Service was attentive.",3 star rating,Lynn N.
1/12/2017,"Valencia, CA","Please note that I am only giving the stars for the food. The service here was awful. All the waitresses and hosts we encountered had grumpy looks on their faces and they really looked like someone forced them to come to work. They looked like they didn't want to be there and it was very apparent. When we asked how long the wait was, the front desk hostess gave me the dirtiest look then mumbled ""25 min"". Even though we had our name on the wait list , several people that came after us went and got seated before us, so they are not very organized. We came on a Saturday morning around 11am so it was packed. My mom had the pancake special and I had the eggs Benedict. The eggs benny weren't the best I've had- they were just ""ok"". I recommend the danish pancakes, those were better, and huge.

5/4/2017,"Wahiawā, HI",Great service cute casual  friendly place.  Danish pancakes nothing special. But the corned beef Benedict was off the charts for me. It was excellent cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Most corned beef is salty. This one was to me amazing. The sausage needed a sauce. I found that all the typical danish sausages in Solvang were not salty. Shocking. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors very subtle. Which only meant u could pair them with a variety of  condiments and not become overbearing.Go early line can get pretty long. It's pretty much the only place to eat breakfast that I could find,4 star rating,Lika G.

Make sure you keep that in mind when planning a visit over, come early! The fruit and whipped cream waffle was fluffy and airy and delicious. The danish pancakes were nice and thin with a tasty strawberry topping. The cheeseburger tasted just like an in n out burger and the chicken tenders were your standard chicken strips. It was super busy so service was definitely overwhelmed and it took a while to get our order taken, but well worth the wait. Plenty of free parking in Solvang that is close to this place!*Update* came at 8am Sunday morning and it was packed, the earlier you can get here the better. Tried the sirloin steak and eggs and the chicken fried steak and eggs, not that impressed just your standard diner food.

9/16/2016,"Encino, CA","Decided to spend a few days in Solvang for 4th of July and we came across this place for breakfast. The line looked crazy when we drove by so my fiancé decided to jump out, put our names in and wait for me to find parking around the corner. This is definitely the touristy spot for breakfast because I heard the locals can't handle the wait and go down to another spot that has no wait lol. Anyway, luckily I find a park on the next block over and by the time I get to the restaurant my fiancé ask me if I want to just sit at the bar with no wait. Perfect! As we sit at the bar, we are greeted by our waitress wearing a little Dutch outfit to take our order. I decided to go with the combo that included scrambled eggs, Dutch sausage and a crepe that I added cinnamon and apple to. I also ordered a side of hash browns to complete the meal. First of all, all the hype about this place is true, the great reviews, the food, the service and hospitality is on point! We had a great time talking to the servers, laughing and asking them about their outfits. The food was nice, warm and delicious.

After pulling into a parking spot it took us exactly 3 seconds to find Paula's and therefore that would be the determining factor on choosing this restaurant. That and the gigantic deck out front to enjoy the balmy weather in. The menu is seemingly inspired by any greasy spoon breakfast/lunch joint and for whatever reason I went with the ""Paula's Special Danish Strawberry Pancakes"". I suppose the faux windmills in town had something to do with it.  A zippy 10 minutes later I was noshing. Service is hardly polished, but friendly. It's a greasy spoon you snob.How Danish Pancakes differ from their say, German relatives, I have no idea. Perhaps the added Powdered Sugar? No clue. But they are certainly fluffy and delicious! The strawberries were fresh and added a nice sweet/tart note between bites. Yeah, nothing wrong with anything and at $9.00 I was stoked, full and back on the road in no time.

It's a bit annoying that 2 larger parties (of 3) that arrived after us got seated first, but I guess that's how they choose to function.  We loved the food we were served, and the service was great.  Our waitress Diane was perfect.  However, the flies everywhere were kind of weird to deal with, and the fact that the management allowed the dogs at the table next to us to actually stand on the table and eat on it was a bit shocking. Not only does that seem like a health code violation, the fact that allowing this party of 3 adult women &1 child to bring 4 dogs to the table seemed a little too much for a restaurant with seating in such tight quarters.  Althogh present when we arrived, unfortunately, management was absent once this party arrived. If this kind of practice with animals is regularly allowed, I guess it shouldn't  surprise me that there were many flies around. So sad.",3 star rating,Ms N.

Parking was a bit of a chore but we managed to get there without a hitch.While waiting for 15 minutes out front I noticed diners on the patio enjoying their dishes. I also noticed an incessant amount of flies milling about. When our party of five was called I was happy to see we were being seated INSIDE.To my chagrin my talents as a multi-tasker were required as the fly epidemic was also present within the main dining area. It's too bad as the Danish Combination I ordered was delicious. I would really have been on cloud nine if I had not expended energy swatting critters away from my head, legs and shoulders.I understand they keep the front door open allowing the wait staff easy access to the patrons outside. This place would earn more stars if they remedied the situation with the bugs. Frankly, I am surprised the Health Department has not been a royal pain to this business. If you come in dressed in a shroud and a beekeepers mask you may not be as sensitive. It's just that for the dollars we spent here I would expect more of a conscience from the owners.

The pancakes were just slightly thicker than a crepe, and a tad sweet. On the side, I ordered a Danish sausage for something savory.

Never felt rushed.Had the thick cut bacon with eggs and I choose hash browns and a biscuit, gravy was mentioned and I said sure.Thick Cut Bacon was on a diet I would say because even though it was delicious it was far from thick,I would say slim.Eggs were ok,hashbrowns were crispy and tasted fine. The biscuit was nice and fluffy and the gravy was great,whole chunks of sausage.For dessert we tried the danish pancakes which were thin but not to the point of a crepe. They were splendid.Hope to return and taste other things on their menu.",4 star rating,Sal M.

4/4/2016,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA","Review number 800I have to give it up to my friend Patrick. His recommendations for places to grab a bite and mine, normally differ from each other. The thing he does know and I will always take the recommendation, are places to grab delicious breakfasts.On our last drive up to the Bay, he decided we stop here before we go on our trek. We chose to sit at the counter and got lucky that we got sat fairly quickly as the place was bustling with customers.I ordered corned beef hash, eggs, fruit, and a side of biscuit, topped with country gravy. The corned beef hash was good, it possibly was made there, but I'm not sure. The winner was actually the biscuit as it was nicely crusted on the outside, but the inside was fluffy and soft like a cloud. The gravy wasn't too thick, seasoned just right with sausage.A nice breakfast place in Solvang if you're in the mood for a ""greasy spoon type"" diner.",4 star rating,Mister S.
4/17/2014,"Irvine, CA","After three or four visits, I've come to the conclusion that this place is absolutely average. The hype didn't do it for me.Yeah, the food is fine but it's not great. Service is hit or miss and the apathy that oozes out of some of the employees here is really unattractive. On my most recent visit, I almost walked right out after seeing the hostess standing there, ignoring everyone who walked in (including us) and when she couldn't get away from her duties, she made no effort to appear less dissatisfied with you. Ruins my appetite.Pancakes are decent, both the thin Danish ones and the fluffy generic ones. I enjoyed them but I don't remember them. Eggs are usually not cooked properly so to be safe, order them over hard or scrambled, otherwise you'll just get soup, unless that's what you like. (My better half got food poisoning after eating breakfast and our three day vacation was spent in the hotel getting very well acquainted with the bathroom. I got sick too but it wasn't nearly as bad.)Sausages are different but fine to eat. Depends on your tastebuds. I found them to be ok but nothing I'd want to order again. Bacon is cooked properly but I don't like the fact that they toss them on top of your pancakes where there's sugar.Chicken friend steak is what it is. Nothing special. Gravy is the same. Good enough.Spinach Salad is fresh and very large. I enjoyed this more than any of their breakfast items.Coffee is good.Bathroom is small and freezing cold.Dining area is a bit cramped with flies buzzing around.Would I come back again? Sure I guess, but I don't mind driving the extra five minutes to go to Ellen's in Buelton. It's not really worth 3 stars but it's not as bad as 2, so, round up to be nice. (Tip: If you're staying at the Hadsten, which is my preferred hotel in Solvang, their complimentary breakfast is small but really good. Their bacon is amazing and they use farm fresh eggs.)",3 star rating,Yuki M.
12/20/2016,"El Monte, CA","Waited about 45 min and our table for 5 still wasn't ready. We heard there were 5 seats available at the counter so we jumped right on it.   We ordered the Dutch pancakes, waffles, and corn beef hash. The food was ordinary like any other diner food. The best thing was their thin pancakes that came with the light syrup. The downside of this restaurant was the disgusting flies that kept flying around. I was so temped to swat the flies with the menu but would've knocked a bunch of  things over.",3 star rating,Linda N.

The staff was so very nice and accommodating with our twins and I just love the Danish theme. I got the Paula's special pancakes with apples- it was amazing! My boy's got the kid's meal (silver dollar pancakes/eggs/bacon) and the gobbled up. This place is a far cry from Denny's and worth the wait!,5 star rating,Kate M.

The ham slice was exactly what you would want in a nice piece of ham. It tasted like it was grilled and had better put on it it was so moist and delicious and cooked just perfect the way I like it. I'm actually glad this place is 10 hours away for me because I could never diet if this restaurant was in Oregon.

3/18/2016,"San Gabriel, CA","Danish breakfast? Sure! A small restaurant with a small outdoor seating area & super long lines! The wait time was about 1 1/2 hours!  Yikes! The pancakes better be worth the wait. Not much of a waiting area so you can wander into the nearby stores & bakery to kill some time.I had to order the Danish Pancakes, substitute it with  Danish sausage, & potatoes. The pancakes looks like a crepe except a little thicker & since it was big, they folded it. The flavor is good. Possibly some nutmeg & cinnamon in the batter. Not too sweet, so I didn't put much maple syrup on it. Texture wise, soft & a slight chewiness. The Danish sausage wasn't much of a wow. Not much flavor or spices but did have a nice snap to the casing.The others ordered a variety of breakfast items which looked good. The steak and eggs sounds good but this isn't a steak house so of course the steak was over cooked.  Typical diner foods. Service was nice. The servers are dressed in Danish attire. Whimsical to see. *Parking on the streets*1 bathroom per gender (be prepared to wait in line)",4 star rating,Tiffany L.
6/8/2016,"Vienna, VA",Very good place for brunch. I ordered the classic egg Benedict. I usually don't order Benedict when I'm not sure about the restaurant as I don't like my egg hard and overcooked.

5/31/2016,"Berkeley, CA","My boyfriend and I were coming to Solvang for our first time and saw that this place has rave reviews - it was even recommended to us by a friend, but I was very underwhelmed. Customer service is amazing, but the food was nothing special. I think ihop is better honestly. Outside seating was very nice and Instagram worthy, but the inside is kind of old for my taste.My boyfriend got the Danish pancake combo with blueberries. The Danish pancake was very pleasant. A lot thinner and less heavy/filling than a normal pancake. Also, has a cinnamon taste to it! The blueberries were served warm, so it gave it a nice sweetness and freshness, but again nothing special. Also, really expensive when making it a combo and adding fruit (I think about $14 all together). I got the gravy topped fried chicken with the eggs and hashbrowns. The gravy was tasty, but the fried chicken was dry. The eggs and hashbrowns were fine because honestly, how do you mess these things up? Lol. The portions were small considering the price ($12 I think). Overall, Yelp has let me down for the first time on this one. Only come here if you can't get a Danish pancake anywhere else and are dying to try one. Otherwise, go anywhere else or go to succulent cafe next door which looks super promising!",2 star rating,Stephanie H.
4/9/2014,"Aliso Viejo, CA","It was a great breakfast place. We got the Famous Danish pancakes as well as the chicken fried steak. The CFS, tasted like it was originally frozen and not fresh so that was no good. I really liked my pancakes. Just a suggestion, you can totally share one between two people. It is a big dish. One more thing that is worth mentioning is that their coffee wasn't that good and they don't bring you cream if you are seating outside. I asked like 2 times from different employees and nothing happend. But would I go back to this place when I am visiting Solvang again? Probably not.",3 star rating,Yasaman J.
3/21/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","PANCAKES PANCAKES DANISH PANCAKES!With a line out the door (and streaming out into the front of other shops) and wait time exceeding 1.5+ hours, this local Pancake House in the little Dutch country of Solvang is one of the most busiest restaurants in the entire town. So what do you do in that case when the odds are stacked (pun) against you? You strategize! Drop off a friend and get your name down on the sign-in sheet while someone finds parking. Then you wait. While you wait on the nearby park benches or wherever you can find a seat and some shade, maybe think about walking next door to the Pastry shop and grab a little sampler to hold you over while you wait and wait. With limited outdoor seating (dog friendly), a decent amount of indoor seating and a breakfast bar, just hope people eat fast and not linger long.We ordered the Danish Pancakes, Hash browns and their Eggs Benedict with salmon and everything was awesome! The pancakes are a generous size and so airy and light in your mouth that it blends in perfectly with the maple syrup. Hash browns are not oily (like the ones you get at Denny's) and nicely grilled on top, but still maintains a soft texture inside. Eggs Benedict with salmon - as good as gone with fresh salmon slices on medium poached eggs melted over a french toast x2!~ Offering freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice to boot!A definite must try if you're ever in the area!TIP: Try calling in to reserve your spot if you know you'll be there at a certain time; it may be able to cut your wait time if they're not super busy, they'll honor it. If it's a busy day (especially on the weekend), they reserve the right not to honor your request.",4 star rating,Sandy Y.

1/9/2018,"Los Alamitos, CA","This was an average breakfast experience for us. We had 12 people and they didn't have a table large enough to accommodate us. They split us 6 and 6, giving us 1 table first and told us that we needed to wait for a second table to open up. We opted to feed the kids (and me) in our party first. The second table didn't open up until we were all just about done eating. So the timing was a problem. Breakfast was fine, standard breakfast quality. In my opinion, breakfast is a very difficult meal to mess up. If you can't make breakfast right, then you shouldn't be in business. So, they did fine, nothing that blew me out of the water though, just average fare. The waitress that served us was cranky though. There were definitely other waitresses that seemed more happy and upbeat. Ours seemed very unhappy with her job. If she had been a better waitress, I may have rated this place a star higher, but for what it was, it was a very average experience.",3 star rating,Chi K.

11/26/2017,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA","Geez, the line to get in here on a Sunday morning is no joke. Luckily, turnover is quick so even if you walk up and are facing a 45-minute wait know that it'll likely move quicker than that. Plus, as a bonus you can walk the streets of Solvang for a bit and soak in that Dutch culture. Once you finally get inside, well, it's a diner. This might be THE SPOT in Solvang for a solid breakfast with some Danish trimmings but at the end of the day it's still a diner. The thing to get is the Danish pancake combo plate, which I did, but other than the toppings (which, again, aren't exactly proprietary) this was indiscernible from any other breakfast I could have gotten elsewhere. This is not to say it wasn't good, but just temper those expectations because it's all standard eggs/bacon/pancakes. I recommend adding cinnamon apples and whipped cream to your Danish pancakes. Yes, you'll feel like a bloated whale afterward but just walk it off and digest all that Danish goodness.",3 star rating,Anthony A.

Because of that, we knew we had to venture past the typical pancakes. We both ordered the Danish Pancake Combination with danish pancakes, 2 eggs and bacon or sausage.

As it is highly rated on Yelp, there is definitely going to a long waiting line on weekends, especially holiday weekends. But this didn't deter us and even though we had to wait close to 40 minutes, we were smiling and happy when we finally got our table right on the patio. The waitresses are all dressed up in cutesy Danish coyntrywomen clothing with blue pinafore and white shirts. Definitely adds to the mood of the town. Our waitress Julie had a beautiful hairdo and greeted with us with a big smile. Despite being busy, she was patient with us while we made our choices. We started off mimosas to celebrate the weekend, the speciality of mimosas here being that they are DIY. We were served two glasses of freshly squeezed Orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. The fresh juice made all the difference and hands down, it was one of the best mimosas we've ever had. For the food, I ordered a plate of Danish pancakes with cinnamon apples and husband ordered a plate of Danish sausage with scrambled eggs, toast and a bowl of fruits on the side. Both the items were absolutely delicious - the pancake being light and thin ( almost like a crepe but not as thin) tasted heavenly with the cinnamon apples and the sausage was flavourful ( as opposed to bland ones which we are not fond of) I cannot wait to go back to Solvang just to have breakfast at Paula's.",5 star rating,Amogha R.
12/22/2015,"Fremont, CA","When I was young and on the callow side, I used to go, ""Oh My God, it's Paula Poundstone's Pancake House! Gotta go!"" The ownership has nothing to do with Paula Poundstone, the infamous comedienne who was arrested for public lewdness while accompanying a minor. For five years though, every time we drove by, it was the Paula Poundstone reference. I was trying to make it funny even many years after when it stopped being funny, and by then, some of my friends didn't even know who my reference was.Well, years later, I love this place. I now tell people this is a totally Classic Old-Fashioned Pancake House. The biggest, fluffiest pancakes. The good stuff galore on top, fruits and nuts, and some fresh juice (no cheap stuff) on the side. The cups of coffee that taste like the 1940's. The waitress staff that also, in good cheer, feel like they come out of that era, too. Everything is pristine, and yet a throwback to classic Americana. It gets so busy, but last time I hit up this place at 6 a.m. as the sun was rising. I was met by so much munchy-munchness and good cheer by the staff.

If you are bigger than a group of two expect to be consistently put to the back of the queue because combining two tables is clearly beyond their capabilities.You'd have a better time ordering their food frozen, taking it home and making it yourself.

They were thinner and fluffier than American pancakes, but had great flavor.  We just got the ones with maple syrup and butter. Bad news for maple syrup snobs like me, it's fake it's not real maple syrup. That being said, the mix that they used is warmed up and not as corn syrupy as a Mrs. Butters worth. We also got the corned beef hash, the eggs Benedict with hash on it, eggs, an omelet and hash browns. Everything was very good and exactly as what you'd expect.

Pancakes: yummy and thin (if you order the Danish type) Danish sausage: definitely different, not very juicy though. Overall, the food is fine but not astounding. I didn't feel like we really got an extraordinary experience with either Danish specialty items. If you're looking for more authentic Danish food, I'd suggest the bakery right down the streetService: this is where the establishment loses 3 stars. We were brought the incorrect dishes (my dish was missing a side, and another diner was missing her eggs) and an extra dish containing the missing items, which we simply divided up correctly. A minute later, one of the waitresses came over and berated us for dividing up the extra dish since we hadn't ordered it (but were missing all of the items on it).

It's a hot spot for this town so I would plan ahead as the wait can be a bit.   I would recommend this as a must try in Solvang!,5 star rating,James H.
2/23/2016,"Rialto, CA",Waffles we're amazing! I ordered mine with strawberries and whipped cream and it was delicious. Came here on a Monday close to noon so it wasn't very crowded but I can tell it's probably busy on the weekend during breakfast hours. Everything I saw looked really good though so if your looking for a really good breakfast place this is the spot.,5 star rating,Gracie N.

2/20/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","After visiting Ostrichland, we headed over to Solvang for breakfast.  Per my Yelp search, it looked like Paula's Pancakes was the top choice.  It was Valentines and President's day weekend, so needless to say there was a already a huge line at Paula's and it was only 9:30a.  Our wait was 1.5 hrs.  We decided to hunker down and wait since we didn't know when we would be back to Solvang.  It was funny to see some people get upset with the hostess on the longer than given wait times.  Don't they realize that wait times are only estimates and if you see a huge amount of people waiting, chances are the wait will be longer than you were told, especially if your party is large. People were having hissy fits.  If you don't like the wait, go somewhere else.  My LO was more patient than some of these grown ups. We got seated outside, which was nice because it was unusually warm that day. I ordered the Danish pancake combo with scrambled eggs, Danish sausage.  The Mister ordered waffles. The waffles and pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  The LO loved them.  It was a good breakfast day.",4 star rating,Rochelle R.
2/18/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","There's enough ratings on here to write a reviewer's Encyclopedia on this pancake house so I'll try and just hit the highlights other yelpers mention:#Orange juice: get it. It was life changing to have the real fresh-squeezed OJ if you haven't in awhile. Trust the people on this one.#The wait: Show up before 9:00 and it's not bad. We noticed after we were seated that around 9:15 (Saturday) the wait jumped from 10 min to 30 min.#The service: Slow because it's busy. As a middle child I have a lot of practice trying to draw attention but couldn't do it with our server. Keep in mind that the price per customer is low, and they work hard for what turns out to be pretty low tips, so hats to them for that.#Sausage: worth a try. It's prob not for everyone - it has a sort of... Christmas... taste to it because of the choice of spices, but it's really mild in flavor, not as salty as you expect a sausage to be.#Pancakes: that's what you came for right? The honey whole grain pancakes were hearty, buttery, and delicious. My wife got the Danish pancakes and they were light and sweet. The whipped butter was great, and the whipped cream tasted like the real stuff - not out of a can.#The fly problem: didn't see any flies. Maybe they fixed it? Bathrooms weren't clean at all, though. I recommend you have a back up plan if you are a germaphobe.",4 star rating,Ben B.
5/2/2017,"San Fernando, CA","The reviews I read about this place are true. The pancakes are quite delicious. Very sweet without any syrup. I definitely plan on eating here again. I also ordered a sausage along side of it and was delicious. The decor is very cute because it's very old fashion. Our waitress, I think her name was Jennifer... Very nice. We came on a Tuesday. And it was still quite busy. No waiting time to get a table or anything, but still busy.",5 star rating,Zulema S.
11/5/2015,"Santa Monica, CA","Solvang - the place in California it takes hours to get to for you to think, ""I'm pretty sure that was a wormhole...am I still in the US?""We walked in at a good time - 9a on a Thursday - and ordered the exact same thing: the danish pancakes with sausage and eggs. Two big heaping pancakes came out quick, followed by a delicious (and very onion-y, spiced with cloves) sausage, and over medium eggs.It was perfect. It was just what I was looking for - seriously good breakfast food for the hangover. Unfortunately I wasn't hungover, but it doesn't matter. I scarfed my meal down like I was gonna lose it, and eventually had to stop right before completion because I was going to actually lose it from eating too fast.I would definitely stop here because it is worth the extra drive. Maybe leave a little earlier, and don't be so anxious to get back on the road?",4 star rating,Jaime L.
8/6/2018,"Palm Springs, CA","This was a wonderful place for breakfast.  It offers many of the standard items you would expect fir breakfast. They also offered thin, golden brown Danish pancakes dusted with powdered sugar. Another unique item was the Danish sausage which our server described as being similar to bratwurst. The servers were all friendly and efficient. The only negative is the parking spots are perpendicular to a very busy main thoroughfare with a pedestrian crosswalk leading to the middle of the parking.",4 star rating,Susan G.

A bit noisy but again it was super busy. I had the Ortega Special, roast beef with Jack cheese and Ortega chili on grilled sourdough. It was very good and the fries were good too.

11/3/2017,"Ojai, CA","We were four hungry people looking for breakfast / lunch and this was the first place we noticed. The deciding factor there was an available parking space right in front and a connecting Danish bakery both signs of food destiny.So the inside is quaint the waitress was sweet and chatty and they had everything a typical cafe would have. The dissappointing aspect is the food is not authentic dutch, nor is most of the food in this town, it's become a tourist trap with zero authenticity. The ""Danish sausage"" just skip it's not special.Bacon and eggs were ok, cheeseburger and fries uninspired, omlettes we're good, peach preserves on the table tasty, but nothing you would crave and go back for, but the service and waitress made up for the food, so there ya have it!The bakery next door a huge disappointment, I ordered a Napoleon and it was not custard center but sugar free whipped topping all for 5.00 I was disgusted!",4 star rating,Laurie L.

7/7/2019,"Lompoc, CA","youtu.be/PEPJq1CDRGg We were on a trip to Solvang - party of 4 with infant on July 4th weekend.Of course, this place is famous and we had been here before once. I clearly remembered that we didn't have good experience on very first visit but we still gave another try.This time we clearly realized that PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY UNWELCOMING.I have proof on video link above. We waited in line for one-hour to get the table.We finally received a table of for without having a place for high chair ( it was more sort of squeezed ) but we were ok since we understood that place was busy. I took a seat with infant. Lady who identified herself as ""manager"" walked to the table in less than 60 seconds and asked us where are the others in your party ? This was clearly before serving menu card or even asking me water after one hour of wait. I explained they are one the way and I received answer with pure insult : ""IF THEY ARE NOT HERE -YOU HAVE TO LEAVE"".Seriously ? Mother of child with my friend couple just went to get infant's bag from car parked across the street and this ""manager"" rudely responded and could not wait for one minute ? I even offered her that if I can get menu I can start ordering. she said she did not care  if I had infant and not to forget my party literally walked in next minute ( with in 2-3 minutes of I had table) .When I asked her I would like to speak to supervisor about her approach to customer and she refused and ASKED US TO LEAVE. I don't think any one would eat after that kind of insult and lack of empathy after one hour of wait.I clearly feel they are taking advantage of their business and abusing ""right to refuse service"".ofcourse we turned out foolish after worthless wait.NO MORAL COMPASS and UTTER LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM. We are locals and friends who visited from LA were shocked with this insult. We asked few of our other friends and we realized lot of them had some level of negative experiences like pressured to order and leave,treating with insult but taken positively as ""just bad day"" .We also thought of giving another visit after dismissing first experience in relation to its popularity but it's now crystal clear that either management is ignoring staff's arrogant attitude towards customers or cherrypicking customers to treat well or with insult. In short, no one or no family should be treated with this level of behavior.STAY AWAY ... ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FAMILY WITH KIDS.I have attempted to videotape the incident on above link... of course did not capture the initial part as I was not expecting this.",1 star rating,Abhishek M.

12/19/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I am not a fan of American breakfasts. I don't like bacon or sausage or pancakes, etc. but I was in Solvang, and my bf is a big fan of all those things and this place had amazing reviews so we decided to check it out. I'm super glad we did!! The $10 mimosa special was my favorite part LOL they give you two orange juices with a small unopened bottle of champagne, and it was the perfect amount. Super yummy. Both of us got the pancake special or something like that. Came with either sausages or bacon, so he got bacon and I got sausage since i am a big Yelper and read that beforehand. Thank you, Yelp, for not failing me again. The sausage was sooooo good! Not too salty, just flavorful enough. Yum yum. The pancakes were thin with butter and powdered sugar, but not thin to the point where it was like a crepe. Definitely a happy medium. If all American (or Danish) breakfasts were like this, I'd jump on the breakfast-for-dinner bandwagon in a heartbeat. The ambience was cute and casual, and our meal was a little pricey, but completely worth it.",5 star rating,Joyce S.

So glad we got a table before the rush. Two things which really stood out here are the Danish pancakes and their danish sausages. Make sure you try them both! The pancake was so light and fluffy (reminded me of crepes) that I actually finished the whole thing myself. And the maple syrup was excellent!! Not too sweet and so light. The sausage was good as well. The other food look and taste very normal.",4 star rating,Nana S.

10/2/2015,"Long Beach, CA","Dude. Who'd have even thought to order an omelette at a Pancake House?Well, I did. I suggest you do, as well.Definitely get the pancakes, but, seriously, instead of a side of eggs ( or something else ), order an omelette for the table so everyone can try it! If you can imagine eggs being supremely fluffy, yet dense at the same time, then you can get a picture of how amazing the egg itself is.I made my own, w Havarti cheese (trust me), onions, spinach, mushroom, salsa and avocado. Dude. Simplicity at its finest. But, just bc their omelettes are dank, don't forgo the Pancakes. Imagine the exact taste of your favorite funnel cake, without the disgusting deep fried nastiness.

5/17/2016,"Monterey Park, CA","I have been coming to Paula's and Solvang since I was a kid and I keep coming back. Without Paula's, Solvang would not be the same. Caution: wait times can vary so be prepared to wait anywhere from 15min to 45min; it all really depends on your party size. The thing they are known here, if the name hasn't given it away, is the Danish pancakes and the Danish style sausage (medisterpølse). If you've never had Danish they are thin and they have powdered sugar with some sort of fruit compote. I typically get the special that has a scrambled egg with the medisterpølse, the pancake with Apple compote. It's good and I think the novelty of Danish breakfast makes it super cute. Everything else they have here seems good but I always get the pancakes and my sausage.",4 star rating,Giovanni S.
8/27/2017,"McKinney, TX",This has become our favorite breakfast restaurant in Solvang. The Danish pancakes are to die for! They are so delicious; they taste like dessert.

7/29/2015,"San Francisco, CA","If you ask anyone in Solvang where to go for breakfast, they will send you over to Paula's Pancake House. They're famously known for their Danish style pancakes and their kitschy decor just adds to the charm of Solvang.On a Saturday morning, we waited about 30 minutes for a table; you're given the option of indoor/outdoor seating or whichever opens up first (we ended up sitting inside). Our server was really sweet and attentive - coffee was promptly brought to our table and she gave us extra time for ordering. Their menu is pretty extensive and in addition to their Danish pancakes, Paula's also has your standard breakfast fare. I ordered the Danish pancake combo (with a fruit topping) which comes with two large Danish pancakes, eggs any style, and your choice of bacon or sausage. The eggs were fluffy, the bacon was crispy and the pancakes were light yet very filling. If you like crepes or Dutch pancakes, you'll like these as they are a similar consistency. I ordered strawberries for my fruit topping, which is an extra cost, and they were fresh. My mom basically ordered the same as me and my sister had one of their omelettes. Breakfast for three people ran us a little over $50; it's pricey but we were full for most of the day.Many people in other reviews complained about the wait and honestly waiting for anything, especially food, sucks but you're in an extremely touristy town - what else would you expect? At least there's coffee to drink while you wait and if your stomach can't wait until you're seated, there's a bakery next door, #firstworldproblems.If you're in Solvang, breakast at Paula's is a must!

Their pancakes are amazing and I'm a bit obsessive with hash browns (anything potatoes actually) so after a bite of Paula's, I was hooked! Crispy and soft! Their fresh squeezed orange juice was worth coming back for in itself lol.

This was probably the best part of the meal! I wasn't expecting much from the sausages since I feel like most sausages taste the same - but not these! Definitely different than the sausages I'm used to. I want to say they're a bit smoother and more pepper-y? In any case, my boyfriend loved them so much he ordered another side of the sausage.

DECOR Loved the charm of the decor and suits classic Solvang. This includes the servers uniform. FOODI did not order the pancakes or the corned beef hash which seems to be the what most people order. I had the veggie omelette, scrambled instead and easy cheese. It was a great option if you are trying to keep your diet somewhat clean. Also makes it gluten free. SERVICEAll servers and staff are friendly. Just had to keep reminding our server of missing items we ordered (beverages and extra breakfast sides) down to some condiments. But nothing major, just annoying to remind standard expectations along the way. Last thing I want to do on a day off. However, it wouldn't stop me from returning.

When I asked where I was in place she said there were 3 more parties ahead of us, after they had called 6 parties I inquired again and she said there were 2 ahead. At which point the manager, Evelin said we would be next. She also said that if I didn't like it I can go somewhere else. As if after waiting for an hour I was going to go somewhere else and wait again. This place was definitely overrated!!! Will NEVER be back.

This place is great if you get there early but once the crowds start to show up the wait can be a bit bothersome when you consider you can get similar breakfast fare elsewhere. Two thinks make this place stand out. The Danish pancakes, in my opinion you should forego all the fancy add one with fruit and whatnot and just go classic with powdered sugarThe second thing that makes this place stand out is their strawberry jam, so delicious with actual whole strawberries in it. Can't get enough of this stuff. In short, unless you're going for the Danish pancakes or the jam, no need to wait, you can get eggs and your breakfast protein addition somewhere else.

It was served with maple syrup. I also had better syrups but it was still good. My husband ordered the Country Fried Chicken. It comes with eggs, bacon or sausage and toast.

3/10/2019,"Santa Ana, CA","We were seated outside right away (got there around 8:45 am). I asked for Paula's special and my fiancé got the waffle breakfast. The food was amazing! My fiancé loved his waffles and the danish pancakes were so so good! My only complaint was the customer service. Our waitress never brought me items when i asked for them (water, maple syrup) and she gave us a plate of toast that we didn't order. A few minutes later she returned and mumbled that the toast was for another table and took it from us and handed the same plate to the table behind us. It was a bit weird. The food was great though!",4 star rating,Haidee H.

Restaurants around here aren't big on maple syrup - they put out tasteless corn syrup or something, but the pancakes here are so good that they don't need it. We had veggie omelettes and shared the Danish pancakes with blueberries. They serve a damn fine cup of coffee too!",5 star rating,Sandy P.

Luckily I had his bag so he could sit under the table. I was a bit off put by that but whatever.We both opted for the Paula's pancake combo - danish pancakes with eggs and choice of bacon or sausage.

5/13/2019,"Egger Highlands, San Diego, CA","Paulas,  is great food, wonderful service!There are many similarities between Paulas Pancake House (PPH) and other Danish breakfast places in the area. But, it is on the MAIN DRAG into and out of town. So, it does have a greater clientele ( it is busy), due in part to it's location to the many hotels directly across the street from PPH.  Paulas will give you many wonderful options for a Typical Danish Experience. Try the Danish Pancakes (Thin crepe-like pancakes sprinkled with powdered sugar) The Danish sausage is a exquisite alternative to your classic breakfast sausage (Dennys type).There is an obvious reason why Paulas is so popular. BOTTOM LINE: Do you want a great Danish pancake experience?PPH will satisfy. HINT: Be prepared to wait a while for a table.",5 star rating,Mike R.

They're excellent.Based on our experience, I would recommend telling the hostess that you wouldn't mind a counter seat - the service is super fast and friendly there, and you get a great view of their old school orange juicing machine when they put it in action.Also, the mimosa bargain is a great deal. Instead of 8 dollars for two glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice, you can pay $10 for 2 mimosas served with your own mini bottle of champagne. It was a good deal for sure.",5 star rating,Savannah P.

The waitresses are dressed in traditional German or European outfits. So cute!+They serve all the breakfast essentials but their highlight is probably the DANISH pancake. The danish pancakes were simply amazing. They are light, fluffy thin pancakes! I didn't order this myself but I'm totally getting it next time!+I actually got their veggie omelette, which was also yummy. My veggie omelette consisted of mushroom, spinach, onion and was topped with melted cheese. My omelette was served with choice or english muffin or toast and choice of hashbrown, sliced tomato, or fresh fruits.+Serves lunch menu after 11AM and after noon on Sundays.+They also serve mimosas if you want to get your drinks on from early morning! :D-Easily an 45min to an hour wait during the weekend after 10AM. :(-My veggie omlette came wish a piece of orange and thin slice of apple. So sad looking, I'd rather not have it in my meal.-I think our waitress was new plus a largeee party was seated right before us so I don't want to give her a hard time but it took her at least 10-15 minutes to take our order since she was taking care of the party before us. We tried to ask if other waitresses could take our order and she could only take our drink order. :T-Speaking of Mimosas, don' be fooled by 2 for 1 deal because you are sharing mini champagne bottle with your partner. It's more like 1 order of mimosa shared with two people but paying for price of 2! Lame.If I need to eat breakfast at Solvang again, I'll definitely be here!",4 star rating,Lisa K.

5/9/2013,"Irvine, CA","One of my favorite breakfast places!Food is great and service is exemplary! I haven't really waited for more than half an hour for a table here but there is always people waiting. The servers are very nice and friendly. Food comes out quick, too so turnover is fast for those concerned about the wait. I always get the danish sausage here with eggs on the side. The pancake is AMAZING! It's huge, thin, and fluffy! The danish sausage on the other hand is really delicious and pairs well with the pancake especially if you dip it in the warm maple syrup. For those interested, they sell these sausages frozen--10pcs for $10.  Their buttermilk pancakes are so good if you wish to go the traditional way. Very fluffy and rich in flavor. Something we can never perfect at home, unfortunately. I'm also a fan of their country fried steak. The batter they use is not too thick. You can really see and taste the meat unlike other places where you wonder if there's really any meat in there. Oh and get their fresh-squeezed orange juice!!! It's phenomenal!",5 star rating,Marissa S.

9/11/2015,"San Jose, CA","THE spot for breakfast in Solvang. I was yelping what's the best place for breakfast and Paula caught my eyes with many reviews and their thin pancake style. It's a small restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. I'm surprised we didn't have to wait long with a crowd on a Sunday's morning. Maybe cause we didn't mind sitting outside either. |Paula's Special| $9.25I think you're better off with Danish Paula Combination because for $1.50 extra, you also get two eggs and sausage or bacon. You only get 2 pancakes itself with the Paula's Special. This was my first time having Danish pancake and I gotta tell you, it's the bombbb. I usually take a bite or two with reg pancake and I'm done but not with this one. I love how it's soo thin which taste almost like crepe actually and the blueberry topping make it really tasty. |Solvang Danish Style Sausage & Eggs | $9.50This dish is your typical breakfast food except for the Danish sausage. It comes with two eggs, hash brown, 1 Danish sausage & toast. We got scramble eggs and it turns out nice and moist. The sausage was thick and meaty. We also got an order of orange juice and it was hand squeezed so it was really fresh! A large one is super tiny though.

9/16/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","The wait was fairly short during Saturday brunch.  They have outdoor patio and indoor seating.  We were seated in less than five minutes.  The restaurant has a old diner feel to it.  Patterned wall paper and a juicer in the corner for their popular fresh squeezed OJ!  My husband and I got a side order of Danish sausage, blueberry danish pancakes, and a large cup of OJ.  OJ:  Good. But is it really worth $3.50 a cup?  Probably not.Danish pancakes:  two, very large crepe- ike pancakes.  Pretty good and I've never had such thin pancakes.  I would order this again.  Delicious with a mix of the blueberries and a little maple syrup.  My husband loved their maple syrup!  It was very thick and sweet.Danish sausage:  one side of sausage consisted of a single link for $4.50.  Pricey!  But I think it's worth trying at least once.  The texture is very good.  Chewy, soft, and the flavor is unlike any sausage I've ever tried.  I felt like their was a certain spice or taste that resembled Pho, a very popular vietnamese noodle dish. It was so... interesting tasting!  That's the best way I can describe it.",3 star rating,Tiffany C.

These crepe-like flat pancakes come with the option to add various fruit compote but, to be honest, these pancakes are phenomenal without fruit and even syrup! They are lightly sweetened, thin, and a bit crispy around the edges. You will fall in love and never want a regular pancake again.Service was awesome. The Danish outfits the staff are required to wear is just the cherry on top. Take my advice and sit out front for breakfast, even on a cold day, because you will really be able to take in Solvangs' charm this way. Will definitely return... some day.",5 star rating,Denise D.

You have lots of choices to eat in Solvang and this is one of the best. They are open from 6am to 3pm so plan ahead to eat breakfast or lunch. Nice outside tables are available but it was too hot that day for us so we decided to sit inside. We had prompt table service with a big smile and a complete menu with lots of breakfast choices and some other lunch type choices.  I had the ground beef steak breakfast and my wife had the Dutch pancakes. We each were delighted with our choice and the food was delicious. I enjoyed the jam offered on the table and we bought three jars on the way out.

We took our time getting to the restaurant, and even after arriving and being told we'd have a 15 minute wait, we stood outside for about half an hour before being seated.I ordered the Danish Pancake Combination. It came with 2 eggs, a Danish pancake, and a Danish sausage. The eggs and sausage were tasty and cooked well. The Danish sausage is huge compared to regular breakfast sausages. The pancakes were the best part of the dish--thin, light, and fluffy. I need to look up recipes and figure out how to replicate this!Service was okay.

On my way out this morning I just had to try the Danish pancakes at Paula's Pancake House that I read so much about. I did not wait to be seated at all when I arrived. Granted they open at 6AM and I got there about 6:15.  Anyway, I ordered the pancakes plus a half order of bacon. It took no time at all for my food to arrive and it looked delicious. Even though the pancakes are thin, they take up the entire plate. I was a little skeptical considering they were so thin but OMG, they are absolutely delicious. Fluffy, light, buttery and HUGE! Take up the whole plate. They come with a small cup of pure maple syrup but I didn't use it. With the strawberries and whipped cream, it was like eating strawberry shortcake for breakfast. The thick cut bacon surprised me too. Perfectly cooked. No floppy fat. Just crispy perfect bacon. I even enjoyed the coffee. I normally hit up a coffee roaster after I eat breakfast at a restaurant because it normally tastes like brown water. Although the coffee is not like you would get at a Starbucks or anything, it actually tasted like coffee and I enjoyed it. Too bad I live 5 hours away. I would definitely be a regular there.

9/16/2019,"Oxnard, CA","Extremely disappointed with this place. I came with my husband and son on a Tuesday morning around 10am. It was not busy at all! The sever sat us down right away. Table near the door, near the server and register. Took her 5 minutes to get us a menu. That was strike one for me. Husband and I looked through the menu and settled on what we would have. 10 minutes passed on, no one came to us to even offer coffee, let alone take our order. I kept looking around and saw the sever talking to one of the waitresses, and a second group of waitresses standing around and chitchatting while sorting silverware. The server came around and asked the couple behind us if they were ready for their check and if they needed any boxes. I said excuse me and she ignored me. That was strike 2. 5 more minutes went by, a total of 15 minutes now. My husbands coffee mug was dirty, and empty. At the 18 minute mark she finally makes eye contact with me and asks do you need coffee? And I just lose it. I tell her. ""I did 20 minutes ago when I got here, we've been sitting around here for 20 minutes and no one has offered us coffee, or taken our order., we've been ignored"" she tried to blame the waitress and tell us she was going to get us a different one. I say ""no thank you, we have been sitting here, in front of you and you had 20 minutes to take care of us. We are leaving.""  I got up and left. This was the worst absolute worst customer service I have ever seen!! I have seen the reviews. And a lot of other people complain of the customer service. And I can see why.

4/18/2016,"Woodland Hills, CA","If your in Solvang and miss out on Paula's Pancake House start over!It is located on the left hand side of the main street as soon as you enter Solvang, you won't miss it. Just look for the group of 20 people standing around at 6:00am. They are open from 6:00am to 3:00 pm 7 days a week. There will be a huge line from the moment it opens, but so worth the wait.I have been here several times and can easily say everything is amazing!The pancakes are huge and super light. Just superb. Highly recommended. The Eggs and bacon, jeez the bacon are huge pieces and thick as well!If you can get luckily enough, try and sit on their patio in front. Beautiful little area. They serve fantastic sandwiches for lunch as well, and they are all hovering around $10.00. But the reason to come here is for breakfast! Again your looking about $10.00 and under per plate.Can not say enough good things about this place. In my top three restaurants I have ever been to.TIP- Get Paula's Special ( danish pancakes topped with warm cinnamon apples, blueberries or strawberries along with homemade whip cream ) $8.95",5 star rating,Colin W.

2/21/2017,"San Jose, CA","Since it was the holiday weekend, I thought the wait was going to be monsterous but it was 40 minutes which gave me some time to walk around town. The pancakes, as everyone before me mentioned, were super thin but I was completely full after my plate. Maybe it was all the kringle snacking I did prior to eating here ;)I had the Danish sausage which was good but I didn't think the sausage was anything extraordinary. My food partner had the strawberries and cream and the homemade cream was so dense. It was awesome. We ordered and got our food in no time. Definitely a place to visit while in Solvang",4 star rating,Anh T.

The food was really good and satisfying. The perfect breakfast place if you just want simple pancakes or some good eggs and hash browns. The wait wasn't bad because the area has a ton of cute shops, so while you are waiting for a table you can fill your time with walking around the town. Overall, this place is really good!",4 star rating,Olivia B.

4/8/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Let me start with the good stuff:DANISH PANCAKES!!!!! These delicious perfect thin pancakes are one of the best I've tried. I gotta admit when I saw them on pictures I thought they were just like crepes but once I tried them. Omg! So different from crepes and pancakes (flavor wise). The semi-sweet butter flavor is still there lingering in all my senses. My sunny-side-up eggs were cooked to perfection and the hash brown too. Now, DANISH SAUSAGE! That's another plus. I've had tried only German sausages and they are heavenly good but this was breakfast and I gotta say they were bomb! Last great thing, my biscuit! That thing tasted and felt right out of the oven. Warm and soft and salty from the outside. If you go to Solvang this is the place you want to eat folks. Trust me!Now that I'm done, let me explain why 4 instead of 5 stars. I didn't like service whatsoever. Only our server was ok.. The others (hostesses) were not attentive at all and didn't even smile or greeted us correctly.

I liked the syrup in that it was also light and not heavy at all. The Danish sausage was just alright, in my opinion. I also ordered a cup of hot chocolate which was really good! We were even hoping that they sold it up front, but they didn't. It was nice and chocolate-y!Our server was meh..ok, but the guy who calls out the names was very friendly.

3/8/2015,"Long Beach, CA","Waited 40 minutes in a pretty large crowd for some overpriced mediocre food. 5 of us were placed at a small square table, with two of us shoved on the same end, so it was pretty uncomfortable. The service sucked, I'll give the benefit of the doubt because it was a busy, late Sunday morning. There was something wrong and/or missing with all 5 of our orders, which is a bit excessive. This probably would've been more forgivable if the issues were addressed in a timely manner.. but I was over halfway through my meal before my eggs and hashbrowns even made it to the table. Also, our waitress took our drinks to get us refills and ""forgot"" to bring them back. We had to ask for them back 10 minutes later. Not to mention the syrup, butter, and hot sauce that we asked for TWICE. We ended up asking the hostess to bring them to us, because our waitress was fairly MIA the whole time. The food was good but forgettable. Won't be back on my own dime. Spent way too much money only to be disappointed.",2 star rating,Lauren W.

Maybe I could have waited an extra hour for the bakeries next door to open but I wanted to beat the traffic rush of the holiday weekend.The place was fairly empty, but it was around 6:15 am. There were flies at the counter as a previous reviewer had said, but it's not a big deal. They weren't near my food.The food itself was okay. I got the pancake and sausage egg combo. The pancakes were huge (larger than my face) and they were okay, but I guess it was kind of like diner food? What differentiates this place from a diner? What makes it danish? The sausage had a slightly crispy casing and a good flavor but nothing spectacular. The eggs were just eggs. A little on the cold side. Honestly I feel like I just ate at a diner. It's a bit pricey for a diner, even though it's in a touristy town, but it's just an average diner.",3 star rating,G C.

I ordered the make my own omelet with hollandaise sauce and avocado. The omelet was HUGE and so fluffy. This sounds weird- but it didn't have an overpowering egg taste, which I loved. The combination I ordered was delicious! The hash browns were thick, lightly crisped, and not oily at all. I seriously devoured this meal so fast! One of my friends ordered the Swedish pancakes and I got to taste a bit of it. I do not like pancakes, but man I am sure a fan of Swedish pancakes after sampling this delicious treat!

My boyfriend, having already been disappointed by Paula's Pancake House on a prior trip, tried to convince me beforehand that the Yelp reviews were grossly inflated and all touristy hype. I unfortunately did not listen to him. Alas, the reviews totally lead me astray. My boyfriend was right. The food was very bland, not tasty or memorable. My boyfriend ordered an omelet with Danish sausage in it, which had truly no flavor. He ended up having to put a whole bunch of hot sauce on it to give it any kind of taste. I ordered the Danish pancakes with fruit on top, which were incredibly bland as well. As for the service, it was mediocre.

1/18/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Paula's is exactly what you want out of breakfast in Solvang. It is warm, cozy, homey and Kitschy. They also serve a sweet breakfast you do not see very often... Danish pancakes, the larger, thinner version of a pancake you see Pippi Longstocking flipping in the children's classic movie. You can get these wonderful delights with just about any traditional topping on them from sweet to savory. For those not into pancakes they have a full breakfast menu... but most people, lets face it, come for the hotcakes. I did not indulge in one, but their milkshakes looked HUGE and intensely rich. The staff was great, the ambiance was perfect but be warned... because this is the archetypal  Solvang eatery the line is LONG. Be ready to wait 45 minutes on a weekend. We put our name in then walked around a bit... after our previous days attempt ended in defeat! It is very clear why this place draws the crowd -it stands without competition in this novelty village.",4 star rating,Eric T.
10/18/2012,"Corona, CA","A cute dining establishment consisting of indoor and outdoor dining.  The outdoors was especially beguiling with the white picket fence, little tables with umbrellas, and bright colorful flowering plants to make you feel like you were at somebody's adorable little grannies house. Special. But that is Solvang anyway.So. What is the secret to a great Danish pancake? Start with a super thin batter (like a crepe), with a hint of spice in the batter. Clove, maybe? Make a couple of them as large as my breakfast platter (i.e huge), then top them with melty butter, a generous sprinkle of powdered sugar and a squeeze of lemon.  Then put a dab of chunky, not so sweet apricot jam on each bite.  Voila! You have one fabulously fabulous Danish pancake. Enough to make your eyes roll, ala Paula, with a little Wendy touch. A match made in heaven, by golly.That does not mean Paula's regular pancake is bad.  It is just as nice. Just a different type of batter.  A thicker pancake but still rich with flavor.  Delicious and light. One of the best he's ever had, says Mr. B.If you are lucky enough to have two of you at breakfast, you can order some of each and share.  A very good idea!   Both kinds came with traditional syrup, but IMHO I think my version was far more interesting.Our pancakes were the super stars, but the rest of our order was equally great.  Patty sausage (good tasting, spicy, lean, and certainly not your routine Jimmy Dean/Farmer John variety). A generous serving.Danish sausage. This is a pinker, plump link sausage that is mild, with some spices including pepper.  A little more flavorful than a banger but with a similar consistency.But the best of all was the bacon (on a subsequent visit).  Thick, flavorful, it will seduce you into all kinds of uncommon thoughts. Perhaps I am getting a bit too excited, but it was so gooood.And they squeeze their own orange juice too.  Must try!Good coffee. Great service. Cute Danish costumes.  I wonder.  Do Danes yodel? They looked like they should.Bottom line?   $24 for the two of us that morning.  And we definitely made our way back with the same great results.  Yum!.",5 star rating,Wendy B.

Because we were seated outside, we had to ask for jam, and the jars they brought us were so empty we were scraping the bottom of them.

8/14/2018,"Rosemead, CA","We stopped here briefly for lunch and had pancakes because... why not. My stepdaughter chose this spot during our planned detour to Solvang and boy am I glad she did! The Danish pancakes are essentially orangey crepes (the best kind) and we opted for fruit toppings: I got warm apple cinnamon and her highness got the strawberries and cream; both were phenomenal with the Danish pancakes. She opted for the Danish sausage (not your typical flavor; strong clove seasoning, but in a good way) and I got the bacon  and man was I glad I did. I even loved the iced coffee that's not on the menu, yet was provided for me because Moriah is an awesome server who was always available when needed. No complaints about food or service, but I did knock a star for the slightly-intimate seating arrangements and the weird, noticeable line that sets up when the two restrooms are occupied. This place would be ideal in a new location with more space, but then again part of the charm and appeal of this place is being in the midst of downtown Solvang with the shops and windmills. Oh, and be sure to marvel at the efficiency of their orange juicer. I'm now thinking of investing in one when I retire or if I ever open up my own taverna.",4 star rating,Aaron G.

We put our names on the wait list and considering the groups of people waiting outside, we actually didn't wait as long as expected, about 15 -20 minutes for a table of two. Service was courteous. I ordered the Danish pancakes with sliced Danish sausage. It was basically two pancakes with sliced sausage in between them and on top. The pancakes were thin but fluffy. The sausage was porky and a bit gamey but with the pancakes and topped with syrup, the flavors worked nicely. Seating is available inside the restaurant or outdoors.

I was 30 miles away for work so I made it a point to drive up for these wonderful pancakes.   1.  I came alone because I was away working. When I checked in I was advised that the only table that was available was at the counter. I said I would wait and then suddenly a small table next to the kitchen was available. Mind you a couple came after me and they were given the nice table next to me. 2. My waitress came and took my drink order and then took the order of the couple that was sat next to me. If course their drinks were delivered first. Not very nice. I wasn't  checked on and when I called her I was ignored. The man at the table next to me had to call her and direct her my way. 3.  When my food did come it was kind of warm. The butter on my pancakes wouldn't even melt.***Update***I spoke to a local who advised that the original restaurant that was at this location was Ellen's Danish Pancake House.

3/7/2018,"Irvine, CA","Cute, quaint, and a place both locals and tourists go to. Their breakfast is pretty standard, scrambled eggs, biscuits, and sunny side up are diner style. What they do have are Danish Sausages which is a good try here. You can have it with either your Danish pancakes or eggs and hash. The sausages were OK, nothing spectacular. What IS a must have are the Danish Pancakes. Much like crepes, they are large but thin, my style because I prefer thin over thick pancakes. A great place to try to feel like a Danish local!",4 star rating,Jessica A.

4/7/2017,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA","Delicous Danish pancakes, but nothing worth making a special trip or waiting an hour for.  Came here on a rainy spring Saturday morning and there was already a mob of people waiting by 8:45.  30 minute estimate for a table for two was pretty accurate.  Strolling around for 15 mins or so wasn't so bad, but saw a lot of other people giving up and opting for the bakery next door or a place across the street.  The Danish pancakes are tasty and gigantic, but very thin, so not terribly filling.  Very sweet too.  Didn't need any fruit or syrup on top.  Solid thick-cut bacon.  They also serve a house-made Danish sausage that is . . . different.  Sort of like a bratwurst I guess, and a little off-putting for breakfast, but maybe worth trying once.  Everything else is pretty ordinary.  Honey wheat pancakes were a bit dry and uninteresting, but not bad.  Like I said, a fine, affordable place if I'm in town and the wait doesn't look too bad, but nothing to write a Yelp review about.  Definitely get here before you get hungry.  Aside from the wait, service is spotty.  The food came out quickly, but it took forever to get a menu and even longer to pay.  Saw several tables seated after us but served before us.  Nothing personal, staff just kinda spacey.  No parking of its own.  There are some pull-in street spots to the west and a public lot across the street a bit to the east.",3 star rating,J M.

8/21/2017,"Pasadena, CA","Great place for breakfast and/or brunch in the little cozy town of Solvang! My family came back from camping, and decided to skip breakfast and have just lunch here, so we were all starving! The portions were decent size, not too little and not overwhelming. We had the Irish style egg Benedict, roast melt, Solvang burger, French toast, and of course their famous pancakes! Everything was delicious and fulfilling. They do decorate their plates with lettuce, sliced apples, and an orange slice, unnecessary to the meal but it's a way to cover the emptiness of the plate. We also had their fresh orange juice, largest, except it's a 16 oz glass, we couldn't believe that was the large. The food did not take long to arrive, but we came on a Monday, which means less people in town so less people in the restaurant. The prices are average, $10-$15 a person. The staff were friendly and patient, answering questions and explaining their menu before we ordered. This place is definitely worth a try, but not amazingly great where it's a must to come back. We have yet to explore the rest of Solvang, perhaps a better restaurant is waiting for us.",5 star rating,Brandon D.

8/21/2018,"Santa Clara, CA","Stopped to smell the roses on National Relaxation Day in Solvang! Tried to make the best of it regardless my daughter sliced her finger on the broken plate she was served on @ Paula's Pancake House in Solvang, CA! Yes our breakfast was ruined when her finger wouldn't stop bleeding! Our quality family time over our 1st meal of the day trashed by Paula's Pancake House Manager! Our awesome waitress gave us a bandaid & the manager asked me to show her the bleeding finger after I already wrapped it, so there it was bleeding profusely. She had the audacity to ask me to show her & afterwards comped her $7 meal. She took the plate immediately and threw it out. Too bad I took a photo before she did! Ergh I wanted to explode, but I calmly told everyone I was done, paid the bill and left. Here's a pic of my princess with a bandaid on her finger. That look on her face was exactly what was on mine when the manager opened her mouth! 1 Star for our waitress who was great, another star for the ok food; danish pancake were salty, very little amount of food for the price, potatoes were burnt, Benedict was great, coffee was good. $80+ meal for a family of 5 definitely not worth the blood!

7/19/2014,"Brentwood, CA","After waiting for 20 minutes, we were seated in really uncomfortable wooden chairs at a table inside. The place is small, so they cram tables into every available nook & cranny. At one point, they separated the 2 tables behind me & I was so close to the guy behind me I could have eaten off of his plate without moving. Service was pretty good. The food was just meh. My hashbrowns had pieces that were so crispy, they were impossible to chew. The eggs were very fresh but I ordered them over medium & they were served over easy. My sausage was somewhere between cold & luke warm. They call it Danish Style sausage, maybe the Danish like it cold? The flavor profile was ok. I tasted a hint of seasoning but it was nothing to note. My daughter said her bacon tasted like fake-n and her French toast tasted like ""donuts"". I stole a piece of my husband's Danish style pancakes. They were very sweet & heavy in the vanilla extract. We stopped eating when he found a hair in it. The waitress apologized and promptly handed us the total bill. No compensation was offered. I still left a tip because the hair wasn't her fault but the whole experience left a hairy taste in my mouth.",2 star rating,Jenn N.
10/4/2016,"Sparks, NV",Just ok. Moved inside because of the bees only to have so many flies everywhere. Gross. I asked the manager if there was a better place to sit and she told us it's because this town is in the country and they cannot do anything about the flies. The front door was propped open letting all the flies come right inside. It's not exactly a country town and those of us who live in more rural areas know to keep the doors closed to solve that problem. Food was just ok. Ten year old liked the tri tip sandwich. I had soup and chicken salad. Just ok. Soup seemed like a ready to heat instead of homemade. Service was fine. Wouldn't come back.,2 star rating,Denise D.

8/11/2016,"San Juan Capistrano, CA","I was a fan! Positives:-Paula's special: Love the thin pancakes, they aren't too heavy. Added fresh strawberries (which were fresh! Not in juice!) and whipped cream. - Tri Tip sandwich: good. Wish it had more meat. Came with a small piece of watermelon which was a refreshing touch. Beans that came with were cold. Bread was delicious. For under $10, it was a good value for this tourist town, Solvang. Reasons why this wasn't a 5 star:-Bathroom is practically in the kitchen. -Service was weird-- Originally a waitress came to take our order and she was super sweet and knowledgeable about the menu, then another waitress came over and basically kicked her off our service and took over mid order.... umm kinda weird.-Menu's need a reface. Coffee stains on the menu is not an appetizing thing to look at. -When we first got there, it was busy. A lot of people waiting as expected, no bench space to sit in the waiting area. We put our name in and the hostess said about twenty minutes. Since she said 20 minute wait, we headed next door to check out the bakery while we waited. Spent about 5 minutes in there and when we came back she said she already called us! What its only been 5 minutes!

From the manager, to the hostess, to the waitresses, it seems as though they're doing you a favor by even looking in your direction. Poor and forgetful service is the least of their worries.

8/25/2016,"Corona, CA","Stayed in Solvang for the day with the family and came across PPH. I saw great reviews and really wanted a nice hearty breakfast/brunch before hitting the road back to LA. Most of the bakeries offered coffee and variety of pastries, but I wanted to be able to sit and dine. There's nothing fancy about the menu, it's a 3 fold menu, with typical offerings you would see at an IHOP. Except the food is MUCH better than what you get at IHOP. The Danish pancakes are a definite MUST GET. It's more like a crepe with the toppings on the outside, but they were light and easy to share. The eggs benedict was also a family favorite. The eggs were cooked perfectly. I like that they offered whole wheat options for my one family member interested in healthy dining. For a table for 6 + 3 kids, we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes during the week. Service was good and we even took some frozen danish sausages to go!",4 star rating,Mary Y.

7/17/2014,"Long Beach, CA","Great Danish pancakes. I would give this place a solid 4 stars overall (one subtracted for ambience), but 5 stars for the pancakes.I am a pancake lover, and these pancakes definitely rate in the top five for me. They are simple but sweet, and while their large size paired with their thinness made them very unique, the texture was still fluffy while maintaining substance. The syrup is necessary, however, as it adds the exact right touch of sweetness and moisture -- otherwise the pancakes may be a bit on the dry side. They are incredibly light, though the diameter of the pancake makes it so that you certainly do not leave hungry.I ordered the Danish Pancake Combination topped with fresh strawberries and with a side of sausage. The strawberries were fresh and were just the right pairing to go with the pancakes. My boyfriend ordered the California Special omelette, and from what I tasted of it, it was also very good -- especially the salsa. The hash browns were also delicious -- perfectly done on the inside and just crispy enough on the outside -- and they paired well with the omelette. The sausage I had on the side was nothing to write home about, though maybe the special Danish-style sausage would have been better.We came at an off-peak time (2:30pm on a Saturday after having driven up from Orange County and made a prolonged stop at Quicksilver Ranch on the way), and judging from the other reviews, this was a good call as the restaurant had tons of tables free and we were seated right away. Parking was ample, and we actually found a spot right outside the restaurant.Overall, though the service was good, the decor and ambience of the place was a little too cutesy and kitsch for me (hence subtract one star). The place could have been a bit cleaner (though we sat outside in the fresh air so it was fine). Also, they make the girls who work there wear these ""traditional"" Danish outfits with a white dress, puffy skirt, bright blue overdress, white apron, and white shoes -- I felt like those outfits belonged more in Disneyland than in a restaurant that can stand on the quality of its pancakes alone. I know this place is a tourist destination, but please let your waitresses wear something a little more dignified!",4 star rating,FeiFei J.

The waitress was sort of rude telling me no, saying ""Our food is gluten filled and dairy filled!"" kinda defensively. Once I said that was fine and that I would just order eggs and sausage, she got friendlier, but it was just kinda a turn off. Plus when I sat down I sat at the bar but not in the last seat because it was right next to the restrooms and felt pretty crowded. She asked me to move in case a couple came... which if the seats were otherwise full I would understand, but there were still quite a few empty seats at the bar plus one of the employees was sitting there just finishing eating, so when she got up there were 5 empty seats next to me. Overall I felt like this place caters more to locals than it does tourists... which is silly since they're in a tourist spot!

10/13/2014,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I was duped by the copious amount of great reviews.I have come to the conclusion, that when a place has a huge amount of reviews that people are possibly reluctant to express their real opinion,.This is not the first time I have gone to a restaurant that has more than 750 review and been disappointed. Paula's pancake house is ordinary at best. I am surprised at the amount of 4 & 5 star reviews. I have honestly had better breakfast at IHOP, and for less money.However, it's Solvang, so one does expect to play tourist prices. Breakfast for 2 with only 1 beverage was $28.30.Hubby ordered the combo with the Danish sausage. The eggs were runny, the flies seemed to like them, and there are a fair amount of flies..His sausage  was bland.We are not sure what is up with the ""maple"" syrup that they serve with the pancakes it was nearly clear, very thin, and tasteless.He suggests ordering the danish pancakes with extra powdered sugar. Then it would take more like a funnel cake and would be better.I ordered the Danish pancakes with the cooked apple and whipped cream. It was nothing special, and I'm not sure what was up with the whip cream. There's no way it was real whipped ,whatever it was , it was gross. Our server was slow, and not attentive. We ran out of beverages halfway through breakfast and it wasn't until our check arrived that I got another glass of water. We went on a Monday and it was not terribly busy, so there was no reason for the slow /lack of service.Now if this had been Denny's I would not be nitpicking. However with all the great reviews I had high expectations.Last but not least the restrooms leave a lot to be desired. The one stall restroom backs up into a parking lot and has an open window no shade over it where anyone can just looki n. It was also not terribly clean.",1 star rating,Donna W.
8/16/2019,"Beverly Hills, CA","Wow, they have great danish pancakes..so yummy!! We went two mornings in a row while visiting Solvang. The first morning we got there around 6:30am and the second day around 10:00am. It is very convenient how they open at 6:00am, and there is absolutely no wait when you go that early. If you go around 9-10ish it slowly starts to get very busy and a line forms. Albeit being so much busier on the second day we went, their service was still quick and great. The food arrives so quickly and tastes so delicious. I definitely recommend getting breakfast at Paula's. The danish pancakes are an absolute must!",5 star rating,Audrey H.

8/8/2016,"Sacramento, CA","I enjoyed my corn beef hash eggs benedict; however, I'm giving this spot three stars because the hype is unreal. regarding the pancakes - yes, they are pretty good, but was it worth the long lines, cramped seating, and only two tiny bathrooms for a packed room of diners?? No thanks. What worse, there are diners sitting about a foot away from the bathrooms. yuck! I get the timelessness of Solvang, but am I dying to come back to Paula's? Nah.

We got here at about 10AM on Monday, 4th of July and waited only maybe about 15 minutes. By the time we left though, there were A LOT of people waiting.We had the classic eggs benedict and the pancakes with a side of poached eggs and bacon. Both were pretty good. The eggs benedict was not swimming in sauce which I appreciate and there was only a slice of ham which was good, so the flavor was balanced (not overpowered by the ham flavor). I'm not really into sweet foods but my bf thought the pancakes were quite good.Service was fine, food was pretty good. I'd recommend checking it out (if the wait isn't too crazy).",4 star rating,Giao T.

3/20/2012,"Anaheim Hills, CA","Had breakfast here before heading out of town. We arrived right on time (maybe 8:30?) because right after we were seated there was a line out the door.Stepping in the restaurant you are immediately transported to the early 1980's. The furniture and decor are very similar to what was in the background of all the pictures taken of me as a baby. I guess it fits with the town.Our waitress was great. My friend attempted to order something and the waitress straight up told her not to order it here, but to go to another business to get it. LOL. At least she was honest.I know they are famous for their Danish Pancakes, but I am more of an egg girl, so I went with the Eggs Benedict. My friend ordered a waffle and sausage. The hash browns served with my eggs were pretty bland. Some salt and pepper fixed them up just fine. The entree itself was quite tasty. My friend also enjoyed her food.This is a great little place to come for breakfast, or if you just want to step back in time and visit your grandma's house in the 80's.",4 star rating,Randi B.
11/4/2014,"Fullerton, CA","This place is horrible.Listen to the reviewers who wrote about being wary of the hype and stay away.For those of you who are wondering what Danish Pancakes are, it's essentially flavorless, crepe-like pancakes that they throw onto the table as they eye you to eat and leave as soon as possible.My girlfriend had the waffles--Same Story.Also if you're from out of town and look foreign in any other way, temper your service expectations and as you get ready to be eject back into Jim Crow days.The subjective perception of eating at a childhood/historic restaurant may deceive and betray the taste buds of some into believing that what they are tasting is what they enjoyed 20 years ago, but as for myself, I strongly recommend spending your time and money elsewhere.",2 star rating,David C.
11/25/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Adorable restaurant that serves tasty food.  All the servers were friendly and efficient, and although they were busy, the staff worked well together to fulfill their customers' needs.  We ordered a club sandwich, polish sausage sandwich (don't remember the exact name), steak and eggs, chicken salad, and ""lite lunch"" with a chicken salad sandwich.  Everything had that ""homemade"" taste and was quite delicious.  The only thing I wouldn't highly recommend is the chicken salad sandwich.  I look forward to coming back to try their breakfast dishes.",5 star rating,Grace C.
9/24/2018,"Solvang, CA","I'm a local and this is one of the few places I'll go for a yummy breakfast. I'm an omelet type of girl and i never complain when we come. You get a big potion meal and it comes with a side of fruit or hash browns and your choice of toast. I always stick with a side of fruit because their hash are sometimes too crispy for my taste as you can see in my picture, they look almost burnt. Their waffles and pancakes topped with fresh strawberries are to die for as well. It's a must stop for someone who's never been here. I gave them four stars only because staff is not always friendly and don't always check up on us after we get our food. But food is always delish. Go try it out.",4 star rating,Monica G.

I've gotten recommendations to try their famous Danish pancakes, so naturally my sweet tooth and I just couldn't resist! I was advised to come early in the morning since there's usually a line out the door, but we must have gotten really lucky to be seated right away.My fiance ended up getting a burger with fries while I went ahead and got the Danish pancake with cinnamon apples, Danish sausage, and eggs. The pancakes were delicious and were complimented by the apples. They were the right kind of sweetness that I love in a good breakfast without it being overpowering (e.g. french toast). Their sausage on the other hand, I mean WOW! Not only was it very tasty, it was also very hearty!

8/1/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Paula's Pancake House holds a special place in my heart because I get to relentlessly mock a Yelp review that S wrote when we first started dating. We took our first overnight trip to Solvang where we stopped by Paula's Pancake House the next morning and in his review - he affectionately called me....""his friend"".I'm glad one of us wrote a review for the place at that time because it helpfully jogged my memory on what we should order! Obviously pancakes even though I'm not a big fan of them. They are lighter than most places and isn't insanely sweet. S got the Paula's special with strawberries and I still feel that the whipped cream is the star. I got the a smoked salmon benedict - I found the hollandaise sauce a bit much (should've gotten it on the side!) combined with the extreme saltiness of the smoked salmon. The hash brown side that came with was perfect though. Service was excellent with a smile. I do think the place is a little hyped. I would wait 15 minutes tops...no more than that. We came in around 8:30am on Sunday morning and only waited just that for a party of 2. Would not recommend a huge party if you are super hungry!

Last year we missed our opportunity to come because of the long wait, but this time around we made it a point to go.My bf & I arrived at around 9:30am... the only seating available was the counter area, which we took and were immediately seated.

12/28/2014,"Rosemead, CA","I came here twice.  The first time I went on a random weekend in July and there were no lines.  The second time, I came here on the weekend of Christmas and the wait is super long.   We arrived at 10 am on a Saturday morning and the wait time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.  People who came after 11 am, had a 2.5 hour wait time.  It was pretty crazy.  Anyway, here is my breakdown of the venue:Food:We ordered the following items:** Blueberry Pancake - this was my favorite pancake type.  The pancake is very thin sliced and when you mix the blueberry with syrup it's so good.  ** Strawberry Pancake - My second choice but I would like to add that the strawberry was pretty fresh as well.** Cinnamon Apple Pancake - Not a fan; you can probably skip this** Regular Eggs Benedict - this is good.  I like how the eggs just melts in your mouth.  ** Waffle with fruits and granola - I thought their waffles were overrated.  Friends raved about the waffle but I thought it was ok.  Maybe folks spoiled it for me with the high expectations** Orange Juice - a tad bit on the sweet side.  Probably ask them to lay low on the sugar**Coffee - just regular coffee.  Service: Service here is pretty good.  Even when the place is super busy, the food came out quickly and our server came by frequently to check up on us.  Parking:If you come super early, they have a few parking spaces right in front of the store.  If They have one handicap spot for folks with disabilities.  If not, you can find public parking or street parking.  Recommendation:Come here between 7 and 9 am.  It gets pretty busy.",4 star rating,Michael H.

The difference between danish pancakes and american pancakes is that the danish ones are thinner, more crepe like. We also ordered eggs with the medisterpolse sausage.

4/30/2017,"Southern California, CA",Stopped by this morning for breakfast while in town. We arrived around 8:45 and were seated promptly because there was just 2 of us and we were willing to sit outside. Our waitress stopped by to introduce herself and said what would be back in a moment. She came back to get the drink order but then it seemed quite awhile before she returned with the drinks and to get our food order. In fact a couple seated after us had their drinks and food before us and she was their waiter too. However once the order was taken the food seems to arrive quickly. Hubby ordered the Danish pancakes and they were great. I loved how light they were. I had the biscuits and gravy. You could tell the biscuits were homemade. The gravy wasn't that hot though it was more like lukewarm but they were still good. I would recommend giving them a try.,4 star rating,Kim J.

The restaurant itself is small, including the tables, and feels kind of cramped. The food was delicious. Of course we had to try the Danish pancakes which were superb.

1/10/2016,"Newport Beach, CA","This place is definitely over rated. The breakfast at IHOP is honestly better but what really bothered me about this breakfast spot was their terrible costumer service. I ordered the Danish sausage with my breakfast and was told it's just like regular sausage but has peppers and onions inside. This was not the case and I asked to exchange it for bacon and they refused to take the charge off for the Danish sausage that was not eaten. They charged us $4.50 for one piece of aweful sausage that taste more like a hot dog. It's just completely crappy costumer service and according to the waitress it has happened before so apparently I'm not the only one who thinks it's aweful. When already over paying for a below average breakfast the very least you can do is take off the charge for the sausage. Even my local ihop would do this with no problem. In fact I've been to fine dining restaurants that insist if you don't love the dish, they will take it back. Rather than cause a scene we paid the $4.50 and I will instead give them this shitty review.

7/13/2017,"Bakersfield, CA","My husband and I ate here before heading back home from Solvang. We were seating quickly, no waiting on a Wednesday morning. Our coffee and cappuccino arrived quickly. Cappuccino cup was really cute and came with a little danish cookie. My husband ordered the Eggs Hemingway, which is eggs Benedict with salmon instead of ham. I ordered the Danish combo, eggs, bacon and we shared the pancakes. Danish pancakes are huge, thin, sweet and oh so good! We had more than enough food for two people. Everything was hot and fresh and delish. Wish I could eat here every morning.",4 star rating,Pam B.
12/25/2013,"Burbank, CA","How can I not stop at one of the most highly reviewed places in Solvang?! My mum and I came here for lunch and this place did not disappoint. Well, I actually came here thinking they sold aebleskivers, so they did let me down in that sense, but their food was delicious. We were quickly seated on the patio, which was lovely since the weather was quite nice. Our servers were nice and friendly and their one unisex bathroom is pretty small but clean.My mum and I shared these two dishes:PAULA'S SPECIAL: Danish Pancakes topped with choice of Warm Cinnamon Apples, Blueberries or Fresh Strawberries, and Fresh Whipped Cream-- This place is famous for their Danish pancakes, so of course we had to order these! Our server recommended it with the fresh strawberries so that is what we got. Probably would have been better if we came during strawberry season, but they were still good. The pancakes are really thin and kind of remind us of fluffly crepes. Combined with the whipped cream and syrup, they were delicious!CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT: Poached Eggs, Premium Smoked Ham, Hollandaise. All Benedicts served atop two Grilled English Muffin halves. Served with Sliced Tomato and choice of Fresh Fruit Cup or Hash Brown Potatoes.-- Not the best eggs benedict I've had, but these were pretty good. Classic indeed. The eggs were poached, but not runny, so that was a tad bit disappointing (I love runny eggs). Paired well with the tomatoes. I wanted to be a little healthier so we went with the fruit cup instead of the hash browns... also would have been a better choice in the summer when the fruits are fresher. The fruit cup consisted mainly of strawberries and grapes, but also had pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew.Definitely a solid option for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!",4 star rating,Esther K.

Sorry. Cheap grade of meat for a $15.00 plate with eggs and hash browns. The steak being the star of this breakfast show was unremarkable. Coffee had a metallic taste to it. Service was good but 2.5 stars if I could. P.S...if your familiar with nice plump steaks don't waste your $$ on this.",3 star rating,Bill H.

Breakfast was excellent!  The place is packed, you do need to get there before 9am or are usually quoted a 45 minute wait. Friendly staff and servers and awesome food. My only complaint would be don't get the table for 4 near the restrooms because there is always a line and so you have people standing right by you watching you eat while they are standing in the bathroom line.

There was a line outside waiting but for two people it was like 15 min. We sat at a little table on the patio, nice day on a Saturday morning at about 930am. We split the danish pancake combo, which was a lot of food; a large pancake (we asked warm apples and cinnamon), two eggs, and bacon. Overall it was good but not the best breakfast I've ever had. It was a nice experience and atmosphere, that's why I have it three stars. I was expecting smack my face flavor and didn't get it.

As soon as the hostess calls her name, we go to the table with her. This waitress then stops the hostess from seating us and says this table is for another party of 6 with a dog. Clearly the table was set for us because she pulls up another table and adds the 1. Make it worse the staff seem to just shun us away with silence, not even accommodating us for their error. We have been eating here for years and their customer service continues to deteriorate. Very disappointing.",1 star rating,Rosanna Z.

It was delicious :) the pancakes were thinner than usual, and because of that we really loved it. I ordered the 'Danish Omelette', which had the danish sausage and havarti cheese. The danish sausage is one of their specialties, and I wanted to give it a try. I don't think that the taste of danish sausage was that special/unique, but they were good in the omelette. My boyfriend loved their 'Corned Beef Hash and Eggs', the corned beef were minced and potatoes were diced into small cubes, which made it very flavorful and easy to eat. Their 'Latte' comes with a danish buttermilk cookie (so sweet&cute). My other two friends got the 'Solvang Danish Style Sausage and Eggs' and 'Create Your Own Omelette', and they also liked their food. p.s. they are also really nice about splitting the check :)",4 star rating,Alice L.

Fortunately when I asked how long the wait was, seats at the bar opened up that were offered to us. Bar seating is of course first come first serve, and we happened to get lucky. The waitress was super friendly. The food came out really fast. The Danish pancakes were delicious and so was the corned beef hash! The pancake was thin almost like a crepe. The hash was tasty and not oily at all. The had fresh made jams in jars on every table which was such a nice touch. And when they give you your check they tell you to take your time and no rush, even though there's a wait outside.

Paula's pancakes are Danish style, which means super thin. I do like their toppings. You can choose from strawberries, blueberries, or cinnamon apples. I had the opportunity to their the blueberries and the cinnamon apples. Both were good.They pretty much have all your breakfast favorites here. I had their side order of biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was huge, soft, and tasted buttery. I wasn't too crazy about their country gravy though. I would probably just order their biscuits on the side next time.The wait can be kind of ridiculous. I would highly recommend calling ahead because they will go ahead and put your name on the list for you. They have both inside and outside seating. They have heat lamps in the patio so you can still sit outside when it gets cold. The service is average.Parking is street only.

He made a waitress cry and screamed at others to pick up the pace when they were trying to make sure she was ok. Tables around us were looking at him with disgust. The food was decent.

2/18/2019,"San Gabriel, CA","Food was excellent and so was the service. Hostess was friendly and server was efficient and friendly. We shared the Danish pancake combo with danish sausage and eggs. Also shared the Belgian waffle with whipped cream and bananas. Both were great. The sausage was about the same as most of the other places in the area, but it is great most places in Solvang. The Danish pancakes are similar to the German Pancake at Original Pancake House if anyone is familiar with them. The OPH German cake is better and Paula's Danish one is thinner, but they are similar and both are very good-if you like one, then you will probably like the other. The waffle had a lot of whipped cream and the cream was above average. Tough trade off because there was so much whipped cream you couldn't really tase the waffle, but then most other places don't give u enough whipped cream and others cream is inferior to Paula's, which is far superior. Would definitely come back here and recommend them to others.",5 star rating,Ronald R.

The menu runs from traditional Danish pancakes to great omelettes. The coffee is typical coffee shop quality so don't expect a great cup to accompany your meal. I recommend the California omelette or Danish pancakes with fresh fruit toppings. The biscuit and gravy was nice as well.

It was one of the best plain pancakes I've ever had. Be sure to get here early because there's always a wait. I tried the Danish sausage and maybe it's just not my thing but I wasn't raving about it. The main reason I give this 3 stars is because of the service. My family came in very early and they weren't busy at all. But we always had trouble flagging down our servers although there were 3-4 of them around the restaurant. But other than that the food is worth the hype.

We got a 25 minute wait time and in no time we were seated at our time. They even accommodated me because I have braces. We sat and ate an amazing breakfast and their danish pancakes are ridiculously good. We had two little ones with us so I put in their order first and asked them to bring out their food as soon as it was ready so they wouldn't get restless. They brought out their meal with fresh fruit and everyone was impressed with breakfast. This place is definitely  a must eat place from the service to food- hands down the best.,5 star rating,Denise G.

Food got to table at 11:15am. We ordered: bacon and eggs meal with hash browns and biscuit and bacon and cheddar omelette with strawberry pancakes.

First off, it was swarming with flies that we had to fight off the whole time.My gf and I got the Danish pancakes combo and a side of hash browns. The pancakes were more pancakes than Danish pancakes (we had much better ones yesterday). It came with the lightest syrup you've ever seen. Probably just corn syrup.The hash browns were very sad looking, especially for $3.75. Ouch.All in all, I can only recommend you stay away from this place.",2 star rating,Olivier S.
1/3/2016,"Santa Clara, CA","Where should I start with this mess of a place...General impression: For those that don't want to read my full review, just know that this place is NOT worthy of it's 4 stars. Just my opinion anyway. --Coming here for the breakfast rush, I knew how IMPORTANT it was to come EARLY. Arriving around 08:00, this place was already having people stand in line for a waitlist. This was a complete disaster, as the service staff absolutely SUCKED. (More on this below)When I had finally got seated, I was a bit surprised to see so many food choices. Food:Instead of ordering the ever so popular (excuse for a pancake) ""danish pancake"" I had ordered the corn beef hash with eggs meal. I did this, because in order to truly review a restaurants full potential, every dish on the menu must be as equally good as the most popular dishes. Why offer a dish that you won't put the same amount of hard work, and soul, as you would another? I won't go into detail about how it looked or anything, but the meal was just as flat as it sounds. Though, the corn beef hash did have a bit of a savoury taste to it. Service: As I had mentioned earlier, the service was an absolute JOKE. Coming during the breakfast rush, more and MORE people had been coming to the restaurant, looking to eat. It was a cold morning, and the restaurant DID NOTHING TO TURN ON THE OUTSIDE HEATERS, despite being open for 2+ hours. The server that was manning the customers, and the waitlist, seemed to be running around the whole restaurant. Constantly being absent for long periods of time, as many customers were confused about how to sign up. Other waitresses were trying to help, seating tiresome customers into the outdoor patio seatings, but before anyone could even be seated, the ""one"" server had stopped anyone from seating, telling them that there was no space anywhere, EVEN THOUGH there was AMPLE seating outside. This was just a complete mess everywhere. Even other reviews say the same about the service here. What a joke.",2 star rating,Brandon C.

8/16/2015,"Houston, TX","My family stopped in Solvang on a day trip and decided on Paula's because it had the most reviews and 4+ stars. We were seated outside near the bakery next door, so we occasionally could get a smell of cookies and treats during our meal, which was a nice plus. The pancakes were hugeee, I could barely finish 1 of them. They had a crepe like texture and the syrup that came with it wasn't too sweet and neither were the cream & strawberries that they came with. My sister ordered the burger and it was pretty standard, nothing special. The service was fast and friendly enough, but the sticky menus and constant flies were unpleasant. We left full but unimpressed.",3 star rating,Celine L.
7/17/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I love coming here for lunch/brunch whenever I visit Solvang. Their breakfast menu is served all day (yummy!). I got Paula's special (Danish pancakes with choice of apples, blueberries or fresh strawberries). They were really delicious and super fluffy. Hubby ordered the diced ham/bacon with scrambled eggs and it was amazing! I tried to steal as many bites as I could until he protested (loudly!). I would recommend going here really early if you are thinking of breakfast as there is always a huge line. Otherwise aim for a late brunch/lunch and you can have your pick of tables.Everything was fresh and delicious. The only negative thing is that they don't let you sit with your dogs even on the patio. They do let you tie them to your seat as long as they are sitting outside their premises. The server was nice enough to offer extra water for my doggies, so I was happy. Overall, friendly service and yummy food make this a hit for me.",4 star rating,Ratika N.
3/24/2012,"Chandler, AZ","I can see why this place has FIVE HUNDRED reviewers.  It is super popular and I can see why, too.  It's cozy, feels unique, has outstanding Danish pancakes, cute server gals, and very affordable prices... the downside: good luck getting seated on a Saturday morning/afternoon.  But, when you do get seated, the service was quick, friendly, and enjoyable.  The Danish pancakes are something you MUST try.  I think pancakes by themselves are blah unless they are really complemented with fruits, nuts, butters, jams OR UNLESS they are Danish pancakes!  These were so good!  Somehow, their version is thin, buttery, absorbent, and just damn yummy.  They served me 2 and I had to stop at 1... too much of a good thing spells uncomfortably, stuffed belly!!  The eggs were cooked well and their bacon was fat, thick, meaty, and tasty.  Also, they served real butter, a plus.I sat at the breakfast bar since I was dining solo and I enjoyed my service and my food...  The place was crowded and lively... I recommend eating breakfast here as it will not disappoint!OH, one last thing, I noted they had a OJ machine (to fresh squeeze OJ, called 'zumo' in Spain) and I just had to get one.  I love fresh OJ - sweet, with some hints of bitterness/tanginess and some pulp - YUM.  Recommend the OJ, too!",5 star rating,April Q.

6/27/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Breakfast served all day, all day. Wasn't exactly impressed with their pancakes. Thought they'd be more similar to Dutch Puffs or Dutch Baby Pancakes which happen to be my absolute favorite type of pancakes of all time but not even close. Felt they were a bit underwhelming on their own - addition of fresh strawberries brought them to life. Also thought the Danish sausage was bland and weak in flavor. Most flavorful part of the meal? Runny egg yolks. Sad to say this but I happen to think Danish savory foods tend to lean on the blander side of things.",3 star rating,MarMar Q.

We came in and were seated immediately and there was probably only two other tables there. They are a tad bit more expensive than a chain, like iHop, but it's worth it every once in a while. The waitress was attentive to us, but again, it was super early when we went. So I can't speak for how the service is when it's busy. My food was delicious. I believe I got the Danish pancake which is a huge thin pancake. It came with syrup and a little apple slice and orange slice. I also tried my boyfriends bacon he got and it was amazing! It's thick cut, not a lot of fat and so savory and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place.",4 star rating,Louise A.

It's expensive (over $10 bucks) , with a  run down looking interior , with average service,and a slightly crusty front desk lady. The only plus side to this restaurant is that my party of 5 got their food within 5 minutes of sitting down. I suspect the cooks were just popping out pancakes left and right.My bf's corned beef hash was microwaved, it was extremely hot in some places and lukewarm in others. The pancakes taste like pancakes I would get at Denny's and the dutch pancakes taste like a thinner Denny's/Mcdonald's pancake to me. Would I come back? No ,because Paul's Pancake house serves average tasting food.I regret waiting 45 minutes at this place when I could have just tried one of the other bajillion dutch restaurants.",2 star rating,Jen T.

Everyone was getting seated but us, including parties of 5-6 people that came after us. There needs to be better managing skills.

The service was friendly and very efficient. The decor reminded me of eating breakfast at my grandmothers house, cute and danish, just like the rest of solvang.Food was average. I wasn't blown away by my breakfast. I ordered the danish omelet and it came loaded with danish sausage and Havarti cheese. I also ordered a side of bacon which was pretty awesome.

9/24/2011,"Beaverton, OR","Food: 1) California Omelet: Very plain and bland. The fruit was a mix of strawberry, cantaloup, honey dew and watermelon. The strawberry was the only thing that looked and tasted pretty good, the rest were eatable. A side of wheat toast came with the dish but I thought mine was way too slathered in butter for me to appreciate it.   2) Corned beef hash and egg: Corned beef hash looked and tasted like it was straight from the can. The egg was scrambled and nothing too exciting or tasty. The hash browns were pretty decent. The biscuit was really dry but i guess that's what they are suppose to taste like. Ambiance: Cute resturant with an indoor, outdoor and counter/bar dinning area. Nice Danish decor inside and out. Huge sign so you won't miss the resturant from the street when you drive by.Service: Nice waitresses. No complaints but nothing notable either. Price: Decent but for the quality of the food, not really worth it. Overall: Kinda over rated. I didn't order the pancakes which is what this place is known for, so take my review with that in mind. I wasn't very impressed with the presentation or the taste of the food from here and I don't think I'd go back.",3 star rating,Amiee H.

I got the blueberry topped on my pancakes. Tasted so fresh and light. Best pancakes I had in a while. The danish pancakes are thin and big. Kinda felt like I was eating crepes but tasted like pancakes. BTW they're huge! If you're not hungry I suggest you split it with a friend.The prices are reasonable. My danish pancakes with fruit and whipped cream was around $8 or 9. SO worth it.The service is alright. The waitresses dress up in adorable danish dresses which really makes it feel like you're in another country. They're nice but you can tell apart real smiles from forced smiles and theirs was the latter. It was only 2 PM and I could tell they already wanted to get out of there. Also, my group sat on the patio and holy schnitzels.. there were SO MANY flies. I had to multi task swatting away flies while eating. One time, I was caught off guard while dazed out and found a fly chilling on my pancake. Good thing I was full..

Once we ordered we got the eggs Benedict and hash browns, mimosas, and the Danish pancakes with Danish sausage. The eggs Benedict was just ok. The sauce was a tad bit bland and the egg was a little overcooked. The mimosas were fine, but the orange juice tasted like cartoned orange juice. The Danish pancake was good! The sausage was weird tasting so neither of us finished ours.If I were to return to Solvang I'd probably want to try another restaurant before returning to this one.",3 star rating,Ali B.

5/12/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","This restaurant came recommended by family, and I'm really glad we listened to their suggestion. The restaurant is not too far from the main group of shops and is quite cute from the outside. The inside decor was somewhat lacking in my opinion, but really who cares about that? My boyfriend and I each got an order of Danish pancakes, one with cinnamon apples and one with strawberries. As someone who really likes thick, fluffy pancakes, I was surprised how much I liked the thin, almost crepe-like Danish pancakes. The food was really good, and with a side of hashbrowns and toast we were completely satisfied.Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. The only thing I'd change was how she brought the bill just as we were starting our meal. Kind of a pet peeve of mine...",4 star rating,Rebecca K.

Love how thin the pancakes were, similar to a crepe!My husband didn't like the pancakes. He said that the pancakes at IHOP were thinner and more crepe-like. The chef also messed up his poached eggs. He did like the sausage. I had a good time eating, although it did seem a little pricey for two pieces of pancakes.",4 star rating,Jackie S.
12/5/2013,"Santa Monica, CA","How have I not reviewed this place yet? This is my faaaaaaaaaaavorite breakfast place, especially on my trips up north. Their Danish pancakes put all other pancakes to shame (why would you eat any other pancake after this?) They are sweet and light, and although they're thin, they're pretty large. I usually do the combo with some over easy eggs, and the plate fills me up! I gave my boyfriend my bacon last time when he ordered the eggs benedict and he said that was the best bacon he's ever had. Not sure if that was a bit hyperbolic, but it was some seriously good, juicy bacon! There's usually a line around brunch hour on the weekends, incurring a 60-90 minute wait at times. But no fear! There are a bunch of Danish shops and bakeries in the area to check out, including a kitschy Christmas store! There's free parking available on the street, which makes it super easy to get in and out without clutching your purse strings.Come here once and you will also make this your staple stop for your trips through California! :) Just don't cut me in line!",5 star rating,Sabrina L.

7/16/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Had a very disappointing breakfast at Paula's this am. Went for the Hemingway eggs Benedict because I wanted the salmon rather than Canadian bacon.The Hollandaise sauce completely lacked flavor. It was more like the 'gravy' of 'biscuits and gravy'  but without the sausage. In other words, cooked cornflour and water!One would think, from the crowds of people waiting for a seat, that this was a great place to eat. NOT!",1 star rating,Michael W.
3/25/2015,"Irvine, CA","There isn't much to do in Solvang besides walk around for a bit and eat some Danish pastries. You can probably see everything that is worthwhile in an hour but there is one reason to visit Solvang and that is for their Danish pancakes. I'm not a fan of pancakes at all and generally avoid them. We were on our way up to San Francisco and decided to make a small detour so we can try these pancakes that everyone seems to rave about. There is a line and it is unavoidable because it seems like everyone wants to eat at Paula's (no competition around them, good for the restaurant). We waited about 45 minutes and according to the hostess, that is the norm. We ordered the Danish Pancakes combination. It comes with a Danish sausage and two eggs. I chose to get them sunny side up. My boyfriend ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict. The food comes out relatively quick which is a plus. Now, these pancakes actually look like crepes. They're thin and stretched out and covered with powdered sugar and butter. Honestly, I loved them. They went along perfectly with some syrup and my runny egg yolk. I did wish that they cooked my eggs longer because they were definitely a little under.I wasn't sure if I loved their Danish sausage but that is probably because I'm not a fan of sausages in the first place. The Irish Eggs Benedict come with the usual except with corned beef hash. This was the first place that asked what kind of eggs you wanted on an eggs benedict. Um...they're always poached. It was a weird moment but they cooked the eggs properly.  Overall, I think the reason why they're so popular is simply because they don't have any competition in the area. I guess that's a good business move on their part. If it was any other place, this restaurant is probably closer to a 3/5 but their Danish pancakes earned them the extra star. 4/5",4 star rating,Michelle L.

The food and service is always so good, but yesterday for some reason I was very disappointed. As we were eating our breakfast along side of two other couples a tall male employee or manager walked by and asked the two other couples at their tables if all was fine with their meals. He completely ignored us as if we were not even there. My husband and I just looked at each other like, what about us?

Pancakes were ok, and the Danish sausage was chewy.  I really wanted to like this place!  I thought I was going to get down on some delicious food, instead, I waited 45 minutes for average food.  The reason Paul's is getting 3 stars instead of 2, is because I enjoyed their coffee, and the staff worked hard.",3 star rating,Lord M.

I am a big burger fan and this wasn't as good as I thought from recommendations from others. The bun got extremely soggy very fast on the bottom where they place their spread and the patties are frozen patties. I am not against frozen patties but these you could tell right away. They are exactly uniform in size, shape and thickness. This is definitely a great breakfast place and I am sure they have some other great lunch menu items but the burger is just your average ""restaurant that doesn't really do burgers"" Burger.

1/5/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","We called Paula's Pancake House right before we checked out from our lodging at 11 AM. They told us there was a 2 hour wait. We said ok, since Solvang is such a cute little town to explore on foot during our wait.We arrived and were told the wait was now 20 minutes. We were seated in 5. Perhaps just great timing, but...SCORE!Even though our seating was outdoors, the noise level was still such that my boyfriend and I could still hear each other talking, which is more than I can say about our experience at The Hitching Post II the night before. The weather also happened to be very pleasant (70 degrees and sunny) so I was happy that the tables we sat at allowed us to enjoy the outdoors without being blinded while we ate - the umbrellas above the tables provided just the right amount of shade.Now onto the food:Eggs Benedicts (about $12 each): He got the classic and I got the florentine. Both were decent, just the right amount of sauce, and the eggs poached perfectly, proper seasoning. Personally, I would have liked them to toast the muffin a little more for texture and crunch, but my boyfriend insists that's specific to me. Nothing special or memorable, but pretty much a textbook-executed benedict, which is exactly what we wanted at the time. 4 out of 5 stars. Hashbrowns: came with the benedicts, great color and crunch on top, got a bit mushy and mashed-potato-like in the middle, which I didn't care for. Also needed salt, but not bad. 3 out of 5 stars.Danish Pancakes ($7.25): Ah, the hallmark of Paula's...was surprisingly disappointing. They weren't bad, but we expected them to be AMAZING based on the reviews we read and how the waitress sold them. These were basically pancakes that were a little bit thinner than what you get at any other American diner, but I couldn't taste anything unique in the flavor and they were more fluffy and airy like American pancakes instead of chewy and slightly crispy on the edges like crepes, which is what I thought we were getting. Maybe that's just the way they are? Or maybe we should have gotten them with fruit topping instead of maple syrup (which was very runny and might have been fake) and butter? We'll give them another try next time, but we really wanted to be wow'd by the Danish pancakes this time. Oh well. 2.5 out of 5 stars.Service was polite enough and very responsive and fast - although it was probably because they wanted to turn tables (there was a huge line of people). That worked for us, we wanted to be on our way to see wine country anyway! Just don't expect them to make a lot of conversation.There's some street parking at the front of the restaurant, but usually it's hard to come by with the brunch crowd. Luckily there are tons of FREE parking lots all over Solvang within walking distance to Paula's.Till next time, Paula's Pancake House!",4 star rating,Catherine C.

This place has mastered breakfast. everything on the menu is delicious, and I know this because I've come here with large groups and have shared lots of food.Their waitresses, waiters, servers, hostesses, and the rest of their staff are all very sweet and efficient and are always willing to help you out if you need suggestions on what to order.

1/7/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","One word: underwhelming. Maybe even two words: super underwhelming. My bf and I were making our way up north to SF and stopped for a few hours to check out the quaint Danish town of Solvang. We instantly pulled up Yelp to see what local restaurants were good and with over 900, mostly positive, reviews, we figured, ""Yelp can't be wrong!"" Boy, you guys really let us down! We walked up to the restaurant and noticed a group of people waiting...surely a good sign. Since we were a party of 2, we were seated pretty quickly and given our menus but had to wait a little longer before the server returned to take our orders. I wasn't feeling super hungry and opted for a small order of the french toast (~$7.50) and my bf ordered the traditional Danish Medisterpolse which consisted of eggs, a Danish sausage, a side of hash browns and a biscuit ($9.25). After placing our orders, we waited a bit and because we ere seated on the patio, the sun was beating down on us pretty heavily! At one point, we had to move ourselves out of the sun because it was too sunny. The food arrived and I wish I could say it was amazing or life-changing but it just wasn't. To be honest, I've had better eggs, hash browns AND french toast at Denny's or IHOP. The portions were a bit small and I thought the Danish sausage was really nothing special. It tasted like a regular sausage to me, albeit with some extra herbs, but it wasn't so flavorful that the sausage was memorable to me. Now, two weeks later...yeah, still not memorable. Bottom line: When you come to Solvang, do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere. There are so many other restaurants and bakeries that line the streets. Please don't get suckered into this tourist trap because that's just what it is: an overpriced tourist trap!Yelp 2015 Challenge: 3/100",2 star rating,Sandy L.

If that place is too packed, they'll find another nearby restaurant.  But Paula's is always their first stop.Usually this place is always packed.  If you don't mind though, you can always sit at the counter if there is no one there without having to wait 30 or more minutes.  That's my secret for you.  What I got here was their yummy Danish pancakes with sausage.  It was good, but the way I pictured it, I thought it'd be pancakes with sausage in it.  Instead it was a huge pancake, with sausage cut up and thrown on top of it.  It was good, even better than regular pancakes.  I probably like it more because the pancakes were thinner.Next up were the Eggs Benedict.  It was good too.  I liked the sauce they had on top of it.  I would definitely order this dish again.Next time I'm in Solvang, I will make another trip to Paula's.  Probably order the same things too.  Oh and they have fresh squeezed orange juice. :)",4 star rating,Emily S.

The sausage was also delicious and the biscuit and gravy was freshly made.  Service was A+. Our server was very friendly, our coffee cups were always kept full and our food came out pretty quickly.

There's seating on the outside and inside here at Paula's. If its a nice day, go for the outdoor seating..you'll have a couple of flys bugging you, but the flys will be more interested in your arm than the food on the table, weird? Maybe they're already full from the previous party that was seated ahead of us???Get the Danish Pancake here no matter what! I'm not a pancake fan, but I love their pancakes here. It's a cross between a crepe and a pancake and the whipped cream on top is also to die for!!! You will have the option of choosing cinnamon apples, blueberries, and strawberries...so good! Get it, you won't regret it and it'll leave you wanting more!Country fried steak and egg was also ordered today. The chicken is heavily breaded and small...not my favorite. The scrambled eggs is also more towards the yellow side, but still good...perhaps more yolk or a pre-made batch for scrambled? The hash-browns were the bomb, just perfect!Early bird specials are also available during weekdays from 6-8am, combos includies the Danish pancake. If you're here and awake around that time, go for the specials!Everyone in general is good, but the Danish pancake makes Paula's as good as it gets! Enjoy!!!",5 star rating,Jen H.

11/9/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","My family and I visited Solvang this weekend and Paula's had a wait for over an hour in the morning all weekend long. We called ahead to put our names in so we did not have to wait as long. I ordered the classic Benedict which I really enjoyed. This is one of my favorite breakfast meals and they did not disappoint. Even my sisters biscuits and gravy were really tasty. I want to try other places in the area on our next visit, but if there is not a wait I would for sure come back.",4 star rating,Kathy S.

8/16/2018,"Millbrae, CA","The lines are out the door here, no matter how early you get there--they do breakfast, lunch, brunch, and close around 3. A group of 6 of us went in for breakfast and ordered Danish pancakes, corned beef has and poached eggs, steak and eggs, hash browns, Danish sausage ... the hash was not memorable--I've had better--but why would I go to a Danish place and order an all American dish? My mistake. I had a craving for it, and ordered it, despite knowing I was better off sticking to their specialties. My sister in law loved their very thin pancakes with powdered sugar, and my husband swooned over his Danish sausage, of which we all tasted and agreed: the spices were robust and mild, fully realized flavor and the texture was unbeatable, e.g. crispy exterior and moist inside. Loved it, and if we lived there, would've happily bought their frozen ones to take home. My brother and nephew loved their steak with eggs--better quality and well-cooked than most diner type places of this caliber. We also got chocolate milk--creamy and rich, and orange juice--not frozen or instant. It's fresh squeezed; what diner does this? None I can think of. Loved loved and then some. The prices are right and they have seating outside, which because it's highly in demand, the wait is longer. We sat inside, which is fine. The service friendly and fast. I'd go back in a hot second.",5 star rating,Ranjan P.

The hostess was not very nice although my waitress was terrific, complete with electric Micky Mouse ears (it is Halloween). First, the coffee. I don't drink coffee much so when I do, I want to like it. This tasted burnt.  I even double checked the menu to make sure they weren't going for a chickory style. Just awful. Then I got eggs Benedict with corn beef hash. The hash was bland and I removed it from the dish. And my poached eggs were cooked too hard (I specified soft). Perhaps one should only get pancakes at a pancake house.",3 star rating,Kimberly S.

I also ordered a side of hashbrowns and sour cream. The blueberry topping was not preserves, they're flash frozen and sit in their own juice. The pancakes were delicious. Unfortunately, the first time the dish was brought out, they provided me with sausage and the wrong style of eggs. The waitress took it back and replaced the incorrect portions of my order. I totally understand that it was a busy Sunday morning and she was overwhelmed, but I'm unsure where it went wrong. Either way, she was still pleasant and made the requested changes quickly.

10/20/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Several of my friends recommended this place. The Danish pancakes are big and thin. They are thicker than a crepe. I was surprised how much I enjoyed these yummy pancakes since I usually prefer thick and fluffy buttermilk pancakes. I ordered Paula's Special which includes two Danish pancakes with delicious fresh whipped cream and your choice of a fruit topping. I chose fresh strawberries. Since it's no longer peak season for strawberries, they tasted like they were macerated with sugar for added sweetness. Although I ordered it with a side of maple syrup, I prefered the tasty Danish pancake with just the whipped cream. My boyfriend ordered the Danish Pancakes Combination, which comes with two eggs and choice of bacon or sausage. He chose the Danish sausage, which tasted like a lean and flavorful meatball. I can confirm the orange juice is freshly squeezed. I hate other places that say fresh squeezed when all it is Minute Maid. Since we were here on a Wednesday, service was very fast. Our server was nice but more focused on fast turnover than friendly charm.Overall, the food and service deserve 4 stars. It's a must stop for anyone visiting Solvang.",4 star rating,Rachel M.

6/27/2015,"San Diego, CA","It hurts me to give 3 stars only because the owner is so awesome. The service was far from friendly and it was disturbing to see how much the servers and hostess didn't enjoy working there. There were also flies everywhere, and the food was just ok.  First of all, how cute is the little town of Solvang!? It literally looks as if Germany threw up all over them, I love it. We came around 11am on Saturday with a 50min wait, so we decided to take a little walk around since we've never been. We come back 15 minutes later only to find out they had already called our name, so we had to wait awhile longer as they had given up our table.. I feel betrayed by the estimated wait time I was given. I noticed that the hostess would point to the table for a party to sit at which was really inconvenient and confusing. At one point there were a handful of tables set up and she pointed for a party to ""sit there."" The party walked over and realized they didn't know which table she was talking about so one of the guests of the party went up and asked her which one she meant and she again pointed and responded ""the middle table"" and the party was still confused, needing the waitress to better direct them. That was quite annoying as the hostess wasn't even busy and just gave off the vibe that she didn't even want to be there. The owner switched off with her at times to be at the host stand, and was the one who called us to be seated. My boyfriend's brother-in-law showed how ecstatic he was to have Danish pancakes and the owner was pleased and seated us. Our waitress again looked miserable and didn't want to help us--she would walk quickly away so we wouldn't have the chance to ask for anything else and once we were able to ask her for something, she would ask several times if we needed anything else so she didn't have to go back and forth even with how small the restaurant is. We got our food quickly--my boyfriend and I shared the corned beef hash that came with hash browns, eggs (scrambled, well done), and toast. The others ordered steak and eggs and the Danish pancake, both of which neither recommend--I tried a little of both and I'd have to agree. Being known for their Danish pancakes and the high ratings they have on yelp, that set the bar high and it was sadly disappointing that they didn't taste egg-y or much different than regular pancakes. Keep in mind my boyfriend's brother-in-law doesn't mess around when it comes to food and NEVER has food leftover on his plate but here, he did. The corned beef hash tasted just ok and wasn't crispy--I feel like the texture was made for those that can't chew food. The eggs were cooked perfectly well. To be quite honest my favorite part of breakfast was the orange juice because it's fresh squeezed. Overall the food was just ok; I'm definitely spoiled with The Original Pancake House at home with the German pancake and perfect corned beef hash.The owner stopped by our table to ask how our food was and we were honest about the pancakes. He was bummed that we didn't like it, apologized, and simply genuinely cared that we weren't satisfied. He let us know he was going to try the pancakes himself to see if the recipe had to be switched up. He is all around just a great guy and if I ever were back in town, I definitely would come back because we could feel how genuine he was. He even took the pancakes off of our tab which we weren't looking for or expecting at all!",3 star rating,J N.

7/5/2008,"East Bay, CA","Danish pancakes are a must!!!  Even though a majority of places were either closed or empty on July 4th, this one remained packed.It doesn't have the fluffy consistency of regular buttermilk pancakes.  In fact, it's quite thin and they even fold it over so you can take bigger bites.  I love the simplicity of it.  It comes with two eggs and your choice of either a Danish link or American sausage patty.  I tried the link and it was very plain.  Our waitress hyped it up because she said it has tons of spices in it; that fact actually sold me because I was expecting something juicy and full of flavor.  It was plain and tasted overly porky. A suggestion to the servers:  When people ask what the Danish pancake comes with, the servers usually say ""It comes with a Danish or American sausage"".  I was listening to nearby tables and almost EVERYONE asks what a ""Danish"" is.  Please explain to them it's just a link.I also tried the corned beef hash and it tasted normal, canned and too salty.  It came in a tiny little patty so if you're looking for something hearty, this may not suffice.",4 star rating,Shannon L.
8/14/2010,"San Francisco, CA","Come to Solvang, there isn't much to do, but there is a lot to see, kinda - a lot of places to eat at! Don't come here and eat at chain store restaurants, you'll regret it! I usually don't eat breakfast foods for breakfast or in general, but I opted to try the Danish style pancakes (thin) and it was delicious! They served two styles of sausages: Danish (long like a fat-mini hotdog) and country small rectangle. They open at 6am! And they serve breakfast all day! DEFINITE must try! If this is the only place you have time to eat out, come here, even if it isn't time for breakfast.I so, so, SO wish I could come back soon!

2/14/2011,"Huntington Beach, CA","After stopping to feed the Ostrich's & snapping some shots of the Mini Horses we couldn't leave Solvang without trying Paula's Danish Pancakes. Hands-down THE BEST BREAKFAST I've ever had in my ENTIRE 31 year old LIFE!!! We ordered a ""create your own omelet"" that pretty much was a Denver omelet w/ cheddar cheese, hash-browns & a biscuit & gravy. Our second plate was the Danish style pancakes, 2 eggs & 2 slices of bacon. Everything from the butter to the maple syrup was the BEST I've ever had. OMG this breakfast was full of flavor & honestly the danish pancakes were the BEST, I loved them because they were kinda thin but packed w/ goodness. The gravy that was on the biscuit was sooooooo GOOD, Like I can't emphasize how tasty this was. Be for-warned, we had to wait at least 45-1 hour to eat. So my suggestion is...Leave your name w/ the hostess, then walk around Solvang & explore. There are a ton of bakeries, little shops to shop & wine tasting. Or come around the 11 AM mark, the breakfast crowd was dying down by then.",5 star rating,Natalie F.

9/8/2018,"Colton, CA","Avoid this place if there are more than 4 in your party. Not only will the refuse to accommodate you they will make your party wait in line while some of you eat. Have been before and even though it is mediocre food at high price we tried to go there with a large group of motorcyclists on a tour of the coast.  They told me they would not accommodate at large group (16 Of is) then refused to pull tables together if we even waited. Asked to speak to the cowardly manager who was standing right there and had been telling the girl what to say, and he brazenly told the receptionist to lie to me and tell me he had left. Liars are the worst. At that point I was afraid to take my group there for fear of what disgusting thing they would do to our food. I mean really, do liars really have any morals, decency or ethics when it comes to anything else.  If you'll lie the way they did then NOTHING is off the table!!  We ended up at Petro's where they took our reservation gladly and made over 500 bucks from us. Not including the very generous tip we gave to the servers.

12/26/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","Being on Yelp a little too much sometimes I see things... I see places that seem to get reviewed more than other places.  Paula's is one of those places.   I read the reviews and people RAVE about the place!  I read that others don't see what all the hype is about.    I have driven past Paula's a few times on a Saturday or Sunday morning.    I have noticed the line!   There must be something to it!  I have a couple of favorite breakfast places in Buellton already but I figured that at some point I would just have to try this place.   Saturday I did! It was a blustery, rainy day in Solvang when we arrived.   Seems that we were arriving just about the same moment as a cold winter storm.   The waitresses were all busy packing up the silverware from the patio.   Inside was the only option.   We were early and were promptly seated.    The girls working there were wearing little danish uniforms.  It was a nice touch and they looked cute but somehow I felt sorry for them.   I wondered what they looked like when they went out at night.   I ordered a fairly basic breakfast and it was very good.   My wife ordered the pancakes and shared one with me.   The coffee was hot and the server was pleasant.  All in all it was a very good breakfast at a very fair price.    Best I ever had? No!   But it was good and I really don't think anyone would ever be disappointed.   Reading my friends reviews I am thinking that maybe a mimosa might have been nice.   Or if I had tried something a little more creative, the chicken fried steak or the biscuits and gravy.    Next time!   And maybe it will be a warm morning, the patio looks great for watching the people wander by.",4 star rating,Douglas M.

Their sourdough French toast is out-of-this world divine!I drool now thinking about my meal. I'm a simple buttermilk pancake person so I ordered that combo with eggs and crispy bacon. And of course ordered a side of their tasty home fries. They are well made with a good crunchy layer on top. We also split a French Toast meal with my gf's which was worth it because they know how to make a good French toast. Felt like I was at a buffet lol but it all really hit the spot. Washed it down with warm OJ. It really was warm. I downed my water so I could have ice to make it cold but it took a while. Who serves warm OJ? Very strange. It really was my only complaint.It was a very hot day and we sat outside, which I really don't recommend because those umbrella's may or may not completely cover you and you have to contend with the flies and the dry heat that almost stifles you lol.

They also didn't offer gluten-free options, which for breakfast is a must. I mean, eggs and bacon are alright, but I left still hungry! My party said that the Danish pancakes were good- as they should be at a pancake house!",3 star rating,meridith m.
9/1/2014,"Irvine, CA","Super cute little pancake house that makes you feel right at home! Solvang is already a cute city. The whole atmosphere of the place makes you feel like you've traveled to Denmark and it's just simply breathtaking. This restaurant makes you feel even more like that!I got the Eggs Florentine, which was absolutely amazing. Got it with potatoes on the side. The Hollandaise sauce was so creamy and delicious. Egg oozed right out as I broke into it. The spinach was delicious. And of course, the benedict can't be the same without the English muffin. The potatoes were done so well--crispy, yet fluffy. Reminded me a bit of a mix between potatoes and hash browns!This place has a huge menu of different types of breakfast foods you can try. Since it's a pancake house, I may have to come back to try some of that.",4 star rating,Cindy Y.

I also tried their hashbrowns and they were also just mediocre.

9/7/2014,"Westminster, CA","Like reading the other low reviews, I got tricked by yelp with all the great reviews. We anticipated a long wait, but with that came high expectations of an amazing breakfast, and we were served something mediocre at best. Out of a party of 5, only 1 person enjoyed their food. 2 of us got the danish pancake, expecting something very delicious but it was just a big big plain pancake. My other friend ordered eggs benedict and was very displeased with the hollandaise sauce. I think what made this worst was that the hostess was not very pleasant, I know they are really busy, but she did not have to be so crude. Our server also forgot some of our orders and did not really come to check our table and for some reason their are flies everywhere outside. Our whole party was very disappointed with the whole experience, especially waiting an hour for bad food & service. -- I am sure none of us would ever come back here.",1 star rating,Tiffinie P.

7/18/2016,"Rosemead, CA","Mid day on Saturday (July 16) we decided to take a drive to Solvang. The traffic was bad which took us 4 ours, luckily we enjoyed the trip but because we arrived there late we spend the night. About 10 am we decided to join the mob of people waiting to get a bite to eat at Paula's Pancake. Glad it was just two of us and it took only 20 min to get seated, compared to an hour which others had to wait. The lovely waitress  ( liked their uniform, Dutch clothing) she recommended their famous Pancake combo which came with fruit and a side order of sausage. I looked around and several other parties had also ordered that same combo. I though the pancakes were very good because it was on the sweet side. I always avoided the line but now I know it is worth it.",4 star rating,Salvador P.

I don't know why they give you that little thing of syrup when the pancakes clearly need a gallon.

I wanna give it 2.5 (3) stars but I gotta do my part to bring down this 4 star deception!So yes, the whole city's obviously a tourist trap. But come on, if you call yourself a pancake house, the least you can do is make them well. It's like they weren't even trying with the house special, Danish pancakes! They were just a thinner, bigger, dry version of regular pancakes. We also ordered the Danish sausage with eggs, hash browns and a biscuit - average at best. The only thing good was their freshly squeezed OJ. Uh...And then there's the service - mixed. My server was a sweetheart but another had the nerve to give us a sour face when we asked to be reseated indoors, after we found ourselves spending way too much time swatting flies away from our food.

7/18/2012,"Carlsbad, CA","We went to Paula's because it was across the street from our hotel. I suspect that the majority of people go here for the same reason. When we asked some locals in town about Paula's and they recommended we do go there. We should have listened.I'm not much of a pancake kinda guy, so I ordered the Green Chili Pepper Omelet while my girlfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict. The chili pepper in my omelet was super tiny. It was about 70% egg, 10% cheese and 10% chili. There really wasn't any seasoning either. I could have created something better than this even if I were hammered. The g/f liked the bene, but she very quickly said, ""Wow, this hollandaise sauce is right from a can."" I rated my breakfast 1 star, she gave her food 3 stars.The service was bad. Our waitress was quite nice and knowledgeable but she never came back to the table. We had to ask random people walking by for things instead of our person. Also, for an OJ, an omelet and a benedict, our bill was over $30. That food was NOT worth $20, let alone $30.I've noticed that I'm not the only one to feel this way about this place. My quick tip was something to the extent of, ""Ok, but not awesome"" and it received 4 ""likes"" on Yelp the very same day and more and more trickled in the rest of the weekend.Maybe the pancakes are the shit and we just didn't order the right thing. If that's the case, then I'm incorrect and my review is off. I can say pretty confidently that the not-pancake part of Paula's isn't that great. I suspect that this place survives on the ignorance of tourists seeing a line outside a breakfast stop and assuming that lots of people means really good. It's not.",2 star rating,Patrick Z.
7/29/2014,"Livermore, CA","Breakfast lovers will find inner peace here. The lowdown: Make sure at least one person in your party orders the Danish style pancake and Danish sausage. The corned beef hash was delicious. The OJ is freshly squeezed and so make sure to get some along with your coffee as you sit outside under an umbrella enjoying the small village atmosphere and undeniable charm that is Solvang.

1/10/2015,"West Hollywood, CA","Yes, we're tourists. That said, we expected food befitting tourists, not a 5 star meal in the middle of a real European city.  Our waitress was kind and quick, smiled and was courteous, and offered just the right amount of checking up on us. The food (Danish pancakes for my best girl and. Belgian waffle with cinnamon apples for me) was better than IHOP, and not as good as something you'd get in a Gordon Ramsay joint - all just as expected. Point is it's a middle of the road restaurant, and it's cute and charming and a nice atmosphere for a lazy weekend morning breakfast.  Likely the best breakfast in town. Drawbacks - those who report flies are correct - even a couple inside.  Also, the hostess was a bit of a sourpuss and wouldn't give us the open table by the window - stuck us by the extra stacked chairs and coffee maker in the back. Oh.....get the fresh squeezed OJ.  GOOD STUFF.",3 star rating,Paul P.

I get that they are busy but I was just one person and you couldnt even smile? I literally smiled at the serves that would pass by just out of courtesy and none of them smiled back. Service wasn't friendly, very robotic and basic. Just doing the job and get it over with type of thing. The waffle was good but did not meet my high expectations.

The waitress grabbed us waters right away and gave us the menus so we could make our choices.I already knew what I was having. Well, of course, pancakes! To the Danish pancakes I went. I like traditional so just got the regular pancake with some whipped cream. HEAVENLY. The pancake was light, fluffy for being so thin, but at the same time had that nice chewy dough-ness to it. We also got some egg dish, clearly I don't remember because it pales in comparison to the pancake. But it was probably good too.

5/27/2014,"Sherman Oaks, CA","Paula's is the consummate small town tourist magnet. It's always packed, and has the smell of fresh pancakes, waffles and sausage blanketing the town from blocks away. With outdoor and indoor seating, it promises to offer something for everyone - even the kiddies - while providing quality and fast service in order to turn over tables as fast as possible.It's a good spot, a fun spot, and dare I say a 'must hit' if you're in Solvang, but the pancakes are not spectacular. They are unique - flat, European-style (Danish, to be exact) that can be served with either sweet or savory toppings and fillings. Otherwise, the menu is pretty typical of a breakfast diner (or Denny's, to be honest) and the food is good, if not spectacular. The focus seems to be on the pancakes, understandably, as the Danish sausage is mushy and the eggs are the same you'd prepare at home. Service isn't exactly with a smile, as these servers are consistently overworked and under-tipped.If you're in Solvang, I'm not sure you could do much better but it's not exactly a transcendent experience. Expect to wait at least a half hour on a weekend to be seated.",3 star rating,Evan L.

CLOGS! :)We just about hit every breakfast item on the menu that one could devour. I had Eggs Benedict accompanied by Hashbrown potatoes and a side of Corned Beef Hash (had a weird texture they grilled it for me longer and it tasted better) and usual Mimosa... they used a really good Orange Juice (taste fresh squeeze with lots of pulp) and Tanglewood Brut Champagne Splits (2 for $8.00) I had 2 by myself *hiccup :) Nikki had country fried steak with eggs and a side of Sourdough toast (she said not enough butter) and they didn't have Grape jelly but homemade Apricot and Strawberry Preserves (which I enjoyed... Nikki did not :(Jeanette and Nikki shared Sourdough French Toast to which they both agreed was the 'BOMB'. Jeanette had pancakes on her own and Toya had Whole Wheat Pancakes with Pecans and a side of Biscuits and Gravy. Everyone was pleased with their meal. We sat outside and we got there by 9:00am there was a 25 minute wait even then.

6/23/2014,"Milton, MA","Yelp conveniently assured me that Paula's pancake house would be 1 of 2 great breakfast visits based on 1 of 2 breakfast venues earning 4 stars within walkable distance from my hotel (Kronborg Inn).  And although I would LOVE to give 5 stars, I must resist considering that I've only been once... despite great food quality (good coffee), reasonable price, large quantity, and service with a smile.Given the very Danish influence in Solvang, it's no wonder that a Danish-influenced restaurant would do well in the categories of: + danish pancakes (the diameter of a child's soccer ball with a thickness b/n french crepe and buttermilk pancake) + potato hash (as in shredded and pan fried almost in patty form)They also are known for their danish sausage, which is served as a whole link that has been pan fried.  It's a white sausage, I think... with very unique flavorings (but danish-like, not irish, not nearly), and hot dog like texture.  Not my favorite item, but luckily Paula's accommodates to those with ALL OTHER sausage preferences...including traditional sausage patty, a turkey sausage, and of course bacon (regular OR crispy).Paula's also provides a vast variety of other home-cooked breakfast foods, including buttermilk pancakes, french toast, waffles, corned beef hash (primarily meat filled and traditional), omelets, mimosas .... oh the list goes on.see for yourself, but i think the high rating and high number of yelp reviews makes this spot a pretty reliable choice.indoor/outdoor (with shade) seating. no tvs. credit cards ok.",4 star rating,Shaina P.
9/20/2015,"Santa Clara, CA","I don't understand what the hype is around this place. I ordered the eggs Florentine and the eggs were poached hard, defeating the point of eggs Benedict. I sent them back, then they came out in the verge of being raw they were so runny. Hubby got regular eggs and bacon breakfast with a waffle, he said it was nothing special. The waffle was good. Not worth the wait or the money.",2 star rating,Naomi H.

5/12/2012,"Pasadena, CA","This place is such a blast... from the 80s. It's very cute but I feel a tinge of pity for the waitresses dressed up in cheesy, almost mocking, Danish garb. But, it is what it is and their orange juice machine making fresh juice won me over.Service was good and they never left us waiting, not even for a second.I ordered their yummy pancake combo with strawberries and it didn't disappoint. After all, it was what their known for. It was good, but I'm not sure it was amazing! The location is pretty good - not too far from the ""center"" of town and next to a bakery if you're craving some dessert (or dessert to go).",4 star rating,Daisy K.
4/6/2014,"London, United Kingdom","Paula's Pancake House needs to be a little more aware of their cutlery considering that every single piece of cutlery I saw when seated at my table was dirty, very filmy, and very spotty - even the glasses. Even asking for new cutlery and receiving an apology from the manager resulted in cutlery that was... less dirty, but still very spotty.When comparing their famous Danish sausage to something someone may have tried, perhaps a bratwurst is NOT the comparison you want to use. A bratwurst is similar in shape and size, but that's where it stops.  A more appropriate comparison is to an English banger with regard to texture and taste.Some over-medium eggs were watery and tasteless. The crepe-like pancakes were lifeless and uninteresting, and the cinnamon apple topping sogged everything into a disintegrated mess in addition to being boring.Tourist trap dining, honestly. There are definitely more interesting and savory places to go for breakfast in Solvang without the long wait.",2 star rating,Cate T.

The bacon was overall pretty good and the turkey sausage was decent. The Belgian waffles were soft and good. Ordered a side of the Danish sausage which was very good! We also had two orders of freshly squeezed orange juice which had some pulp in it. FYI order the large because the small size is like a kid's size drink.

6/12/2018,"Orange, CA","Used to love this place but after the experience I had today with my sister in law and mother in law, we won't be going back there.  We arrived around 10:45 and there were a few people waiting for tables. We went inside to check at see if there was any open seating at the counter. The entire counter area was open except for one person sitting at the end.  So we sat down and our drink order was taken. After being served our drinks we were about to order when the hostess came up to us very rudely saying our names weren't on the list and we had to get up and put our name on the list and we couldn't sit there.  Every restaurant that has counter seating that I have been to is fair game and open for walk-ins. Since when do you put your name on the list for counter seating?  It wasn't so much that we couldn't sit there, but more the way we were scolded and told by the rude unprofessional hostess and told we had to leave. There are better ways of telling customers something like that.  The two stars are only because the food is good... too bad we won't ever be going back.",2 star rating,Lauren B.

1/30/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I've had the pleasure of coming here 2x for breakfast, and the food was great each time!ATMOSPHERE: The outdoor patio provides a view of the Solvang with lots of flowers and plants lining the walkway and rails. It's not too crowded, and they have umbrellas for each table. Inside is cute, and the counter seating is a great option for smaller parties to grab a quick bite. FOOD: I had the belgian waffles with pecans, warm apples with cinnamon and whipped cream. Delicious! The waffle was hot, thick, but a tad on the dry side. Per our servers suggestion, I tried it with the pecans and it added great flavor and texture. Big portions leave you satisfied and make you feel like you got your money's worth.SERVICE: The waitresses are very friendly (making conversation with folks I assumed were regulars) and are quick to get whatever you need. Only downside was the host ignored us, and the people in front of us, before taking our names for a table. When I asked him if I could sit at the the bar he wasn't very friendly with his reply. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying when you're hungry and want some coffee.If you're in the area I recommend trying for breakfast! Great food and big portions!",3 star rating,Liz M.

I ordered a half order of eggs Benedict. They were cold (which how does that even happen) and the hash browns had no seasoning whatsoever. To make things even more interesting, there mimosa was a DIY--bring out the bottle of champagne and orange juice.

8/7/2014,"San Diego, CA","I don't understand what the whole fuss is about, this place was not worth the wait. The food was eatable but not impressive and the service was horrible. On our last day in Solvang we decided to try this place out for bfast, a group of 10 of us headed there expecting a wait because it was sunday and it was highly rated on yelp.  We were told the wait was 45 minutes, but we ended up waiting over 1hr! while we were waiting for our table we approached the hostess stand and the man working there was more concerned about having a discussion with his buddies that were there for breakfast that answering our questions. When we finally got seated no one came to take our drink order or ask if we were ready to order, after we noticed that the table next to us (the friends of the host) got seated and their orders taken we complained to the staff and asked for someone to at least take our orders. Finally 20 minutes after being seated they come around to take our order. The food was decent but i had higher expectations, they are just an average diner nothing special about the taste or appearance of the food... next time we will skip this place and try something else less crowded.",1 star rating,Esperanza R.

1/7/2015,"San Francisco, CA","This place was a disappointment. Though we were seated rather quickly during a busy lunch period, the service was so so. We had to flag down a waitress to place our orders after waiting a good 15 minutes. The hospitality wasn't present either. We had the Danish sausage (Medisterpolse) and the french toast. The presentation was lackluster. The sausage was barely warm, and the eggs were nothing special. The french toast was decent. Overall, we thought this place was barely on par with any of the major breakfast/diner chains out there. I suggest going to nearby areas in Solvang and trying bits of other foods there. There are other vendors that sell the Danish sausage and for cheaper, as well as many bakeries. I felt that we wasted a meal at this restaurant when we could have had a little bit of this and that around this walkable town.",2 star rating,Tony C.

2/10/2017,"Torrance, CA",The danish pancakes are sooo delicious.  I also tried the Danish sausage too and it was real good too. It's not your typical breakfast sausage either and doesn't have the fennel taste either.  My server was nice but she wasn't very helpful either and messed up on my order.  I ordered the Pancake combo (eggs and choice of sausage or bacon) and a side of Danish sausage.   I never got my bacon. I had to ask another server for ketchup b/c my server wasn't around for me to ask for ketchup.  At one point she came and asked if I was from Simi Valley b/c I looked like someone she knew from her mommy play group.  Other than that she left me alone and didn't really check up on me or asked if I wanted anything else until it was time to pay the bill.  It is typical breakfast and lunch food.  It's all fresh you must try the Danish pancakes You will not be disappointed.,4 star rating,Jen G.

Because the portion is so small I'm giving it 3/5)  So we decided to order an extra 2 orders of danish sausage on the side (sausage was really really yum so it's a 4.5/5)2) we also ordered a danish pancake which was served with cream but they didn't provide any syrup!(3/5) Overall, We stayed in Solvang for 2 days and 1 night.

I did this and when I arrived later, we were seated immediately.I was disappointed because I wanted the option of ordering the Danish pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream AND a side of eggs and Danish sausage. This isn't an option, you can either order the pancakes with fruit and whipped cream OR plain pancakes with eggs and Danish sausage. I requested a substitution and got everything I wanted, but they charged me A LOT for it. Breakfast for 2 people (after tax and tip) was close to $40. That's pretty expensive for my taste.

Even though our names had been called while we weren't there, when we did come back, they were able to seat us very quickly. The guy taking the reservations even came to check if we needed anything during our meal and how the food was. He would stop to make conversation with tables too.Then the food! I'm usually a waffle person, but coming here may have converted me to pancakes. I have to say I ate the best pancake EVER here. I had the Paula's Special Danish pancake with strawberries. The pancake has its own sweetness so you don't even need the syrup. Then the strawberries were super fresh and their whipped cream is heavenly! It was extremely creamy and rich while still being airy, without too much sugar. Seriously best pancake ever and it's a pretty bit portion.My brother had the Italian omelette and the eggs were super fluffy. There was a generous helping of vegetables in it and the hash browns had a nice crispy crust. It was egg-celent. Hehe.Lastly, their freshly squeezed orange juice is delicious. It was a bit expensive but it is fresh afterall. We were sitting by the machine, watching the oranges being squeezed and what looked like unrippen, sour oranges made extremely sweet juice. My brother and I had to get our own glasses or else we'd be arguing that one drank more than their fare share.Paula's Danish pancake has probably ruined other pancakes for me, but I can't wait to come back. I shall be dreaming of the day I do.",5 star rating,Marisa L.

We got there around 830 in the morning the wait wasn't too bad as soon as we left around 11 o'clock the weight with horrid but the food is worth it if you like waiting the only problem is the portions are smaller than usual but that is fine don't want to get too fat from the delicious food.,5 star rating,Dave C.

2/16/2012,"Monterey Park, CA","First time in Solvang, so we decided to come here for breakfast. No wait in the middle of the week. Such a cute little town. Everything is literally...very little. Anyways, I ordered the Danish Pancake Combination. It included two danish pancakes sprinkled with powdered sugar, eggs, and choice of sausage, ham, or bacon. I chose the sausage. The pancake was delicious. Not your average thick heavy pancake but something more like a crepe. Soft in the middle but a little crispy at the ends. Add a little maple syrup to the pancake. Such a light taste, reminds me of a crepe. The eggs were alright. Just your average eggs. I liked the sausage a lot. it was well cooked and the flavors were good. It had pepper and maybe five spice. Not your average sausage. You gotta try it yourself. Overall, it was a great breakfast. I didn't come out full but just right. I just hopped over to the bakery next door. -Give it a try!",4 star rating,Jocelyn V.

It was the perfect start to my weekend trip. The Danish pancakes are huge, but thin almost like a crepe. It was really yummy. It tasted rich, creamy, and very fluffy. My husband actually got the Danish Pancake combo, which came with sausages and eggs. Of course I had a bunch of his pancakes ;)I got the Veggie omelette, which was also delicious. I would definitely come here for breakfast again!!TIP - The wait for the table could be really long, you can call ahead to put your name on the list, exceptionally if you have a large party.",5 star rating,Anna W.
12/20/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","I stopped by here recently while on a trip to Solvang. It is pretty crowded, even on a weekday. We had to wait 15 minutes to get seats at the counter, which weren't especially comfortable since you're basically sliding off of the seats.All in all, the food is quite good. The Danish pancakes were spectacular; as good as I've ever had. They are basically like crepes, except extremely sweet. I personally had the chicken fried steak and eggs (shared the pancakes with my partner), which was pretty good, but not especially memorable. I was very disappointed with the biscuit that came with a meal, which was as hard as a rock.The food quality was probably ~3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 considering that the service provided was exceptional, and also that Danish pancakes are extremely unique and you're unlikely to find them in many other places. I don't think it would be worth a 1+ hour wait though (which is what I hear it is like on weekends).",4 star rating,Daniel F.

I got a lot of funny stares when I walked into the restaurant. I definitely looked out of place, but who cares, I'm here to eat. We were quickly seated and given our menus. They had a lot of different breakfast choices to choose from. I went with the danish pancakes with danish sausage and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were delicious and I hate pancakes. This were thin, light, tasty, with a light crisp. The syrup was watery but in a way that was enjoyable. The sausage taste was okay and you could still chew on the casing. The eggs were good because they were bright yellow and not blended with milk. I enjoyed the food here, not the awkward stares.Recommendation: Danish pancakes",4 star rating,Andy N.

2/9/2018,"Santa Clarita, CA","What a great trip up to Solvang from Los Angeles. Great place to visit and all the little establishments to pop in and out of are cool just to even look.  I got started early by headed to Paula's Pancake house and located right off the main street, it definitely stands out and the line of people standing outside really gives people the notion that this place is a can't miss pitstop.  The inside definitely gives you the traditional diner feel and with a generous crowd noise to muffle your private conversations, you can definitely enjoy yourself with a friend and not feel like its too loud causing you to scream into the ear of the person next to you.  Quite of bit of choice on the menu and with their traditional offerings, it begs anticipation of whats to come.  Unfortunately a disappointment expecting a foreign flavor of some sort but for sure a delight to eat with each plate coming with a nice hearty serving.  Didn't see much competition in the neighborhood so this place stands alone if looking for breakfast visiting this quaint town.  Overall, food was good and prices were worth it. Be alert of parking, very limited.",4 star rating,Joe G.

My favorite part was  definitely the Danish pancakes! They were light and had a perfect hint of vanilla. I also ordered fresh squeezed orange juice which was great! Don't be discouraged by the long wait, this place is totally worth the wait. The line moves pretty fast and the staff is extremely friendly.

This would be an easy 5 star review but I had to drop a star because of the horrible coffee. If I could have a breakfast this good WITH top notch coffee I'd be in heaven! Fortunately I ordered the whip cream on the side and it was thick & cold. I used some of it as a coffee creamer which brought the coffee up to a respectable level but still (sigh.) Service was average, waitresses wear cute Danish outfits and I like that they have a bar so you can get really fast service. Atmosphere was nice, right in the mix of Solvang with a pleasant patio outside. My advice for Paula's: There's no big franchise coffee houses in Solvang - no Starbucks, no Coffee Bean, no Peet's.

So basically they don't follow first come first serve but follow  based on party size , like if you had a party of 2 or 4 and even if you came 30 minutes late they would seat you. I told them repeatedly that the kids have been waiting for close to 2 hours by now and they finally seated by 2 30 PM for an 12 30 initial checkin. Highly recommend to get the exact timings for larger parties over 4 and they artificially give false wait times as the seating process is just antiquated.

The restaurant server entirely handled thus snafu inappropriately, was rude, let us try to fight it out with the other party of Chris which ultimately resulted in us storming out without any sympathy, apologies, or alternate arrangements from the restauruant. For Christ's sakes if you have 2 exact same reservations, why wouldn't you clear this up with a last name (which, btw, we had given the hostess but when we brought that fact up, we were tols they only write down the first names?!?) The hostess made us feel like shit... we were put in the position to work it out with tbe other party?! F*** this place. Only reason we even gave them one star is the silverlining of walking across the street to La Sirenita where we were immediately seated with the warmest staff and was helped with respect and dignity, which all customers deserve.

I was very much looking forward to the danish sausages. But, it was a disappointment... It is similar to a bratwurst, but more bland. It had an unfamiliar taste that lasted in my palette for the whole afternoon... I was also looking forward to the Danish pancakes, but they were really just average...

SO good. They're essentially a cross between a crepe and an american pancake, so they're lighter and easier to finish. Also bonus - not too sweet, so the apples complimented without overwhelming. Perfectly fluffy and flavored. Solvang Burger: Served on a french roll with grilled onions. They were nice and let us order this even though lunch wasn't technically for another half hour. It was delicious, and well-seasoned. No complaints. Great fries as well.Overall, service was just okay.

4/15/2018,"Temecula, CA","We stopped in early on Saturday morning, around 7:15 am and the place was pretty busy.  The bar was full and a few open tables.  A few minutes after we sat down, there was then a line of people waiting.  We were told to take a seat, which we did.  And then we waited.  Nobody came by.  I went up to the front desk and grabbed a couple of menus.  Nobody came by.  I flagged down a waitress who said ""let me get your waitress"".  She came by and asked if we wanted coffee, we declined the coffee.  She then went and spent the majority of her time walking, talking and servicing the people at the counter.  They seemed to be locals as she talked and giggled with most of them.  We finally ordered the ""Danish pancake special"" with the thin pancakes and danish sausage.  The pancakes were nothing special, just thin dry pancakes.  The danish sausage might be your thing, but it wasn't ours.  I would try someplace else and we will next time for sure.",2 star rating,Joe T.

Do not get deterred by the wait time.  There is so much to see around and keep you busy while you wait.  If nothing else, you can read more about the town and get ready to tour the town.",5 star rating,Sarah P.
10/10/2011,"Whittier, CA",The Danish pancake was really good. 4 stars-2 Star for the older Hispanic lady at the register named Laura was so unprofessional. While looking at the breakfast special out in front of the business this Laura rudely walked up took the bulletin board away and said the specials were over. We were already on our way in so I approached her asking if she would honor the prices that brought us from the street into the restaurant and she looked down at the counter and said she couldn't because the register wouldn't let her but I could have the other special prices for all the other things except the steak special..really!!  That told me that she was capable of over writing anything on the bulletin board except the steak special which was a personal decision of hers in order for me to pay more for the very thing I showed interest in. She offered the banana pancake special and I told her I didn't want the banana pancake and if she didn't want to do this for a customer to just forget about it.. On a positive note our waitress Dawn was super friendly and suggested for us to order Danish pancakes not knowing our run in with that idiot that had pretty much ruined our first visit to Paula's Pancakes. The moment Dawn starting serving she made us feel like like #1 customers and that made us believe this place is pretty cool except for one unprofessional employee/ manager that literally doesn't like her job or customers very much! If I find myself in beautiful Solvang I'd definitely come back to Paula's only if Laura is no longer working for this gem of Solvang. Eat at this place people!

I just recently found out about Paula's Pancake House - it's not like I go to Solvang every other weekend. At least once a year. This place gets so packed that most likely you'll wait 30-1 hour just to sit.A must get is definitely the danish pancakes! The service is so home-y...You got down to earth people.

10/1/2017,"Diamondhead, MS","The food was great! The issue was the service. Every morning they put out a list of specials in the front window by the entrance on an approximate 6""x10"" card. The special I got was country sausage, eggs, potato's and toast for $7.99 til 8:00 am. We arrived around 7:30 am. When we received our bill , the price for my dish was $9.25 and not $7.99. I mentioned it to our server and she went to discuss the bill with someone in the kitchen. When she returned she stated that there was no special for my dish. I then proceeded to show her the special in the window. Guess what? the sign had been removed! I went to the cash register and asked to speak to the manager. When she arrived I mentioned that the sign with the special had been removed and immediately the girl at the counter opened the drawer and bingo there was the sign with my special. They then took off the extra charges. I did this review to expose deceptive practices and to advise patrons to make sure you are charged the right amount.    Solvang is a beautiful town and wonderful people. If you decide to eat at this establishment, be sure you check out the specials and that you are charged accordingly. T.P.  Prescott, Arizona",1 star rating,Timothy P.
2/22/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","LOVED IT HERE!   The Hubbs got the Danish Pancakes with Fruit and Syrup while I tried the Eggs Benedict.  Both were spectacular!  They added a halved olive to each of the benedicts so that it kind of looks like boobs but who cares...it was delish.  Loved that the english muffins were still nice and toasted when i dug into them.  The pancakes were divinely fluffy (even while being thin) and sweet (but not too sweet), which was a problem as I'm already craving them again now.Came on P-day (Pres' Day) at around 7am but we couldn't order the Early Bird Specials since it's not valid on Holidays or Weekends.  Arriving here that early also allowed us to easily choose a table and receive prompt service.  When we finished eating and drove past it again after checking out of our hotel people were already waiting outside.   The downside is the price but what isn't overpriced in this tourist trap of a town?",4 star rating,Leni A.

5/29/2016,"Huntington Beach, CA","Decided to check this place out based on the reviews. Wait was really long. I should have listened to the other reviews about the hostess. She told me 20 minutes and I thought okay not so bad. Well an hour into the wait, I checked with her again to find out where we were in line. There were 2 people in front of us. We then got seated within the next 10 minutes. She is really funny to watch. She just smiles and throws out numbers. There were 3 other groups that were there before us that waited another 45 min after us. Place was very outdated and the flies outside were annoying. The good overall was good, but for me ambiance sets everything. Had the The Paula pancakes with warm cinnamon apples, it took this review to a 3 star instead of 2. I had 2 eggs, bacon, hash Browns and toast. It was decent, nothing to rave about. Probably won't dine here again.",3 star rating,Tamara B.
4/17/2014,"Columbia, MD","This is an oldie but goodie. The authenticity of the decor definitely shows that this place has been around for awhile with the old wooden tables & chairs and the low bar stools. The service is great - all the waitresses are polite, friendly, and attentive. I'd HIGHLY recommend the danish pancakes with fresh strawberries and some whipped cream on the side. The pancakes aren't the normal circular shape and fluffy. Instead it's flatter and bigger, more like a crepe but a little thicker but still full of flavor.  If you're looking for meat, try the Danish sausage - it's homemade and a little on the sweet side. The corned beef hash eggs benedict was also good if you're looking for a savory dish! If you're in Solvang, stop by for breakfast/brunch! Bon appetit!",3 star rating,Michelle J.

They make it with giant bread slices with lots of eggs and cinnamon. I chose bacon and wasn't disappointed with that either. 2 large slices that werent too chewy and not too crispy. I wasn't a fan of the syrup they use, though. The best way to describe it was like the glaze on a glazed donut.I ordered a side of strawberries, but never received them. Turned out to be a good thing, though because I had 3 pieces of that french toast since my fiance couldnt finish all of hers.

8/31/2013,"CA, CA","Would have given them a 4 star review, however their staffing and service wasnt good.Note if your coming for breakfast on a weekend get there prior to 7:30 am. We showed up with a party of nine at 7:40 am. There was a couple people ahead of us on the list and several open tables inside and ALL tables open outside. We wanted inside seating and since they couldnt accomodate us with one table we'd have to put two together. At any rate there were several two party couples seated at large tables and additionally the people ahead of us were seated the same inside.They call us for seating and now its only for outside seating and tell us itll be another 15-20 minutes if we want inside. Well now its about 8am and 25 people behind us thatll get seated right away outside and severely prolong our time to eat if we wait so we opt for outside seats and are the FIRST to be seated outside. Immediately the outside seating is FULL. So the waitresses come out and hit up about 5-6 tables before us. By this time everybody knows what they want since your looking over the menu while waiting outside and those 5-6 tables get their order in instantly. Our waitress comes by and gets our order. All those 5-6 tables get served their food before us. This is what pisses me off about this place.Our server was actually good and had a good attitude and was friendly with a personality. The food was good. No complaints with the food. There are several other breakfast establishments in town that seating wouldve been immediate at that time since we walked by them to get to Paulas.

1/7/2010,"Torrance, CA","If you are in Solvang during breakfast time (or anytime of the day that you are in the mood for breakfast as it is served all day), Paula's is a fabulous choice.  During a weekend trip to Solvang, my boyfriend and I went to Paula's for breakfast around noon. It was a holiday weekend - January 2nd, a Saturday morning, and prime time for brunch, so there was an intimidating amount of people waiting for some good cookin'. We were given a wait time of approx. 25 min., but after wandering into a shop for only 10 of those minutes, we had already missed our name! They kindly seated us next, but word to the wise, if you're a party of two, don't wander too far.The upper 70s made for perfect outside seating, so if you like a side of windmills with your pancakes, I do recommend.   As for the food, I am more of a waffle person, but I figured when in Rome and all that, so I opted for the Danish pancake special. There seems to be a special combination that goes something like ""very large + very thin + powdered sugar = delicious."" With a side of good scrambled eggs, thick-not-overcooked bacon, and my boyfriend's hash browns to steal, it was a most wonderful breakfast.",4 star rating,Mary C.

Looked through the menu and there were many items that sounded delicious; we ended up getting Danish Pancakes and sausage with a side of poached eggs and ham, the ham definitely made it feel like Thanksgiving on a random Saturday.

As shown in the pictures the pancakes are huge. It was light, thin, and good. It was different for me since I do love my pancakes being fluffy. Overall it was a nice sitdown, a time away from sitting in the car. Good food good rest.",4 star rating,Mia L.
7/8/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","This quaint place (yelp.com/biz_photos/N2ya…) was enticing from the first time I laid my eyes on it.  In fact, the entire city dazzled me with its architecture.  It reminded me of Amsterdam without their canals.  The orange juice was so fresh, it hurt.  Seriously.  It wasn't heart burn, but it hurt. I think it was the acid.  It was the freshest and bestest (I know that is not a word) orange juice I've ever tasted.  Naked juice, move over ... still can't get over how FRESH that orange juice was.  I'm sure they sprinkled it with crack.I heard awesome things about their Danish pancakes (yelp.com/biz_photos/N2ya…).  They were indeed excellent - layers of heaven.  I've realized I like thin... thin crust pizza, now thin pancakes. It just tastes better.  The batter was AMAZING.  Again, I suspect crack.And to add to the piggy in me, I also ordered their Belgian waffles topped with crushed pecans (yelp.com/biz_photos/N2ya…) because I wanted to compare and contrast to the real thing (waffles in Belgium are to DIE FOR!).  But I couldn't because Belgian waffles IN Belgium are accompanied by a cream not usually used here.  Belgium cream is more milky.  I had the Belgian waffles at Paula's with butter.  It was still amazing and to add to my happy tummy, I found that pecan was used IN the batter as well!  What a very nice surprise.  And I almost forgot, I ordered a side of Danish sausage which was excellent in taste and of a more mild flavor.  Needed my protein!  I didn't finish everything though.  That's what friends are for.  ;)  I will definitely come back for more fatty goodness! *oink*oink*",5 star rating,Alice C.

They're huge but nice and thin, I had no problem finishing the whole thing. If you go here you should get these without a doubt. The eggs I had were scrambled w/cheese, alright but a little dry and overcooked. I didn't care for the danish sausage, it was a big piece but something about the flavor turned me off, a few others in our group thought the same...Corned beef hash is like every other you've had except they serve it in the form of a hockey puck, seriously...Fresh squeezed OJ is always a plus...Service was great even when they were busy and the prices are not bad, definitely my go to breakfast spot when in town",4 star rating,Michelle T.

He was looking forward to eating good pork sausages (not America crap) & this was a let down. Also... his Corned beef hash was from a can more than likely, with eggs benedict was nothing to rave about. This was our 2nd time at this location I thought I remembered it being better. There are so many little bakeries & places to eat, I doubt we'll ever go here again.

6/11/2007,"Woodland Hills, CA","Solvang is somewhat lacking in a wide array of places to eat breakfast. But what they lack in quantity they certainly make up for with quality at Paula's Pancake House. Seeing a crowd forming outside their front doors in the early morning hours is nothing unusual. The people come for their three page breakfast menu, where you can contemplate having the popular Danish pancake, traditional buttermilk, or even the equally appealing and tasty omelets and sausage. I ordered the Danish pancakes with strawberries, which costs slightly more then having it plain with butter and whip cream.  But to me adding fruit to pancakes is a must, especially when you get to choose between blueberries (which my girlfriend ordered) or cinnamon spiced apples. I should mention that if you do get the fruit option it will come sans pads of butter and whip cream, which for health conscious people like me is perfectly fine.It took only minutes for two super sized and thin pancakes to be set before me. They consumed the entire plate, had a mound of beautiful strawberries, and sitting on top was a small decanter of golden maple syrup.Forking a piece of strawberry, a slice of pancake, and only a dab of syrup, they tasted great. It's hard for me to distinguish between pancakes, saying one I've had is better then another. But if I did have a list this would certainly rank high. Warm, sweet, and moist, this was certainly an above average satisfying pancake. I even liked it more when I used some of my girlfriend's blueberries which tasted incredibly sweet and fresh.I would go back to Paula's if I was in Solvang during breakfast hours. Heck I might even stop by for lunch when they're still serving breakfast. It may be touristy and have a long wait, but this is one place where the tourists are actually right. This place is certainly worth the wait.",5 star rating,Doc K.

We were also rushing to make it before bfast stopped, but we learned that they serve bfastall day. woohoo!I must forewarn you of the line, we had a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad, but if you're ravenous, you might not like the anticipation. We both got 2 large and thin danish pancakes - mine was topped w/ strawberries + homemade whipped cream. His came with sasuage and eggs. I'd recommend asking them to have the whipped cream on the side as it makes the pancakes really soggy (still good but...).The sasuage was a tad overcooked, but since that's not what we were here for, we were verily happy with good foodfinally in our stomachs. =) For those who care about the fresh sqeezed OJ... it was too sweet for me - I think they may have addeda touch of sugar...anyway the hubby ended up drinking most of it. ^.^",4 star rating,Mimi C.

She again just said they didn't take reservations. I replied that I understood that, but wanted to know whether there was another way to get a large party seated, maybe to call that day as their website suggests. She said they did not take reservations. I again reiterated that I understood that but that their website says ""we accept call-in reservations ONLY on the day of your visit"" so I assumed they accepted them on the day of the visit.

We ordered two coffees to clear the fog in our heads and settled for the California Special Omelet and the Danish Pancake Combo.  There was some slight disappointment that the Belgian waffles weren't served all day; we just felt that all breakfast items should be served all day but I'm sure they have their reasons.  Whatever they may be.Our food was fresh, made to order, and served quick.  The omelet had fresh green chilies and a perfect blend of jack and cheddar shredded cheese that didn't taste waxy and fake. It was topped with ripe avocado slices and came with a wonderful pico de gallo sauce and ripe tomatoes. The side biscuit wasn't exactly piping hot and I was really looking forward to that but instead I got a cold biscuit and some frozen stiff patties of butter but it's a small price to pay for such a great mouth watering omelet. The pancake was a sight to see!  Huge!

Another server saw what happened and totally made up for it which was great. Parking is not good and there is a wait. Prices are 8.5-10$ a plate on average.All in all not bad...",3 star rating,Adam E.
8/2/2014,"Kailua, HI","Just got back from an 8 month trip to Denmark, and I was certainly excited to be coming back to America. This restaurant was a perfect amount of American with a taste of Danish. It was just what I needed! The service is fast and the servers don't take time to be really chatty, which I like. They're kind but certainly more interested in getting you what you want, and fast. We got here before 8am because it seems to get INCREDIBLY crowded starting at around 8, and I can imagine the wait is VERY long. So get here early! My mom got the medisterpølse and I got the California style omelet and both were delicious!",5 star rating,Kristin W.

1/26/2009,"Redondo Beach, CA","Went with a group of folks to go wine tasting in Los Olivos.  Although our accommodations offered a free continental breakfast, we opted to walk a few blocks down to Paula's Pancake House.We were extremely lucky because we arrived after 9 on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait.  Looking at the menu, there were many delicious sounding options.The 1/2 eggs benedict was popular with my group - 2 people ordered this and LOVED it.  The 1/2 benedict is great for the people that want to feel better about dieting and can say that they only ordered ""half"".  :-)Another person in my group ordered the Danish pancake with sausage and eggs.  As previous yelpers have indicated, it is light and fluffy and dusted with powdered sugar.  While the pancake was delicious, I think the Danish sausage was outstanding!  OJ is freshly squeezed and delicious and contains some pulp.  This is a place that I'd definitely return to when we're in the area.",4 star rating,Bryan T.
3/18/2010,"Westminster, CA","Came here this past Sunday for brunch. The restaurant looks a little beat up and old but the food was pretty good. It was a nice afternoon so we opted to sit outside which got kind of hot after a while.My bf and my friend both order the Danish Pancakes Combo. One added fresh strawberries and the other added cinnamon apple to top off the danish pancakes. I was able to eat some f the danish pancakes and thought it was quite delicious. It was fluffy, soft. moist and thin. Not too sweet and the strawberries was so fresh!! The dish also included eggs and danish sausage. Another friend ordered the salmon lox bagel. From what I saw, it looked like she was enjoying her meal. As for me, I ordered the Eggs Benedict with fresh fruits. This is my all time favorite breaskfast item and I must say Paula's makes it quite good. We also ordered a bottle of champagne to make mimosas out of it. It was decent but not great. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend it to anyone coming to Solvang for a visit. Total bill was $80 for four people including tip.",4 star rating,anna n.

4/5/2013,"West Sacramento, CA","We wanted to hit Succulent Cafe for lunch and were devastated to find it closed for Monday lunch. We wandered along the street and ended up choosing Paula's partly based on its nearness to our original destination, and partly due to the Yelp sticker of approval on the storefront. Usually Yelp doesn't disappoint, but come on, people! This place is a gimmicky Denny's! We waited 20 minutes to be seated, and then my pregnant self proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for a simple veggie sandwich and fruit salad. I might point out that these items require no cooking whatsoever. I was pretty annoyed and starving by the end. Finally the waitress brought me out an extra fruit salad to tide me over... approx. 1 minute before my order came out. It was the last plate to come out in our whole group, although the others had ordered cooked items.As for the food, it screams 'Sysco mass-produced rubbish'. Example: My dad ordered the Danish pancake and was all excited to get it with blueberries... until it came topped with CANNED blueberry filling instead of fresh blueberries. Seriously?! Gross.So the waitresses wear cute costumes and there are like 2 Danish items on the menu.. It's still a Denny's in disguise. Highly mediocre.",2 star rating,Stacy G.
11/30/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Danish pancakes, where have you been all my life?!?! So thin and light and fluffy, wayyyy better than American pancakes! Their combos are great and the homemade sausages are so fresh and I could really taste the pork... pretty lean, too! I would definitely have picked up a pack of 10 (which they sell frozen) if I had been able to transport it home. Great coffee to boot with free refills; we must have had at least 4 cups each - really woke us up for the 6 hour drive to SF (darn traffic)!Even a weekday morning around 9-10 had a 20+ minute wait, so I highly advise you to plan in advance and make reservations. We took a nice stroll around downtown Solvang while we waited, such a cute town :) Paula's was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.",5 star rating,Joanne L.

I've never written a review before because 1300+ reviews should be enough lol. But I felt that this time I needed to write one. We were sitting down eating and the ""owner"" ""manager"" 7 foot tall guy, decided he would discipline the workers in front of customers. And since they don't speak English it made it more akward to listen to. He was basically repremanding them in front of people. I mean maybe take them to the back and have someone translate for you? Or wait until later like after hours or something? I don't know. I just know that I wish it would've happened not in front of customers.  Kind of takes away from what this place is all about.

It comes with a whole chile folded inside the eggs. Service was attentive and friendly but not smothering. Sit outside if you can - it's a gorgeous view.

8/11/2008,"Cerritos, CA","Paula's Pancake House is a great place to go for breakfast. Everyone says your visit to Solvang isn't complete if you don't come here. Visitors seem to agree; there's always a massive group of people waiting outside. The food is so light and yummy. My fav is Paula's Special: a Danish pancake (similar to a crepe) with diced strawberrys and cream. It's so filling, but light. Another goody is the Danish pancake with Danish sausage. You'd figure that the service would be mediocre because it's always busy. But the service is GREAT! The waitresses are very patient and friendly. My dad thought he ordered scrambled eggs (he ordered over-easy), and when we got our food the waitress said it would be no problem to change it. The staff is very attentive and they don't rush you. It would be best to get here as early as you can if you don't want to wait long. We passed by on the way to church at around 7:45 and people were seated right away. My family and I got here at 9 and we had to wait about 15 minutes. When we left, the group waiting outside was huge; the wait had to be 30-45 minutes. Also, don't come in big groups. I'm sure they would accommodate you, but it was be a long wait because the restaurant isn't very big.",5 star rating,Chynna Y.

10/19/2013,"Anaheim, CA","The Solvang area has it's share of pricey establishments that serve breakfast, and Palua's is no exception (~$9.75 or so for bacon and eggs). However, it has a cozy atmosphere, despite being able to seat large groups, and provides a well rounded menu of items to choose from. I usually don't get restaurant pancakes as I think they are always too thick and fluffy (and get filled after a mere two bites). Danish pancakes, though, are large, thin delights! And the Danish pancakes at Paula's are fantastic. For a more hearty breakfast, I will order a standard bacon and eggs, with hashbrowns and toast. Have never gone wrong with those. The service is usually very good to excellent. A few years ago it seemed that service was extremely lacking (which caused me to skip this place for a while).

11/27/2012,"Sacramento, CA","The best time to eat at Paula's is 6:30 am. Solvang is still asleep but Paula's is already serving their phenomenal danish pancakes and egg dishes. In a couple hours, the wait will be twenty, maybe thirty, people long. But at that time you'll be able to order fresh squeezed california orange juice or a steaming mug of joe in peace and quiet. If it's your first trip, the paper thin danish pancakes are a must. Whether have this option, buttermilk pancakes, of waffle, you can add your choice of toppings. I'd suggest strawberries and pecans or, as noted in previous review, diced ham. If it's your second trip, you might want to go for an omelet with green chiles, avocado, and cheese. This is the main breakfast spot in Solvang so you'll be rubbing elbows with tourists and locals. On my last trip, Paula's was filled with a wedding party grubbing down before the ceremony. It's truly representative of Solvang.",5 star rating,Mairead R.

Just a 20 minute wait for 2, but we weren't offered indoor seating, so we got a couple gusts of wind that took napkins and empty cups unawares. Second mistake was not being persistent with the server, she forgot my water, and oh gawd did I need it! Lastly and worst mistake, I ordered lunch, the tri-tip sandwich. The bread was 99 cent store quality, and the 'tri-tip' was just as cheap, and super dry. After soaking the thing in the baked beans and salsa, it tasted pretty good, but definitely not what I'd go 'out' to eat for.

The burger was fresh, juicy and not greasy, and cooked to perfection - nice and medium. My dining partner had the Swedish Pancakes with apples and I could not resist a sample... so satisfying, eggy goodness with just the right amount of sweetness. The portions are very generous and the taste so good it is challenging to leave over enough to take away.  The staff smiles were evidence that working there is a pride and joy in their presentation of our meals and checking on us when our mouths were not chewing away... they really  care about our experience there.Looking forward to revisiting this down home pancake paradise!",5 star rating,Lisa R.

4/20/2017,"Fremont, CA","My review is based on how deceived my husband and I felt. We were first timers and did not know what to expect. We got a quick table outside and were helped by a really sweet waitress. We orders the cappuccino and latte for 3.75 each. I also got the whipped cream fruit waffle for 8.95. It let's you choose one fruit option but you can add on for extra charge. The food was good however when we received the bill we paid right away because we were in a hurry to leave. When she came back with the card and I was ready to sign I noticed that we were charged 4.75 for the drinks and 10.95 for the waffle. I doubled checked the menu if I looked at the wrong price but nope: I was correct. We were overcharged. When I brought it to the waitress attention she said she will take care of it but then she came back saying ""we ordered large coffees and added on to the waffle"" and first I doubted myself again so I let it go plus I didn't want to make a scene over 4 dollars but I checked again and there were no large options plus our coffees were extremely small for it being a ""large"". It felt really deceiving and it's the principal. You're menu states one price and you charge your customers a different price. Last time I checked false advertising prices  are against the law.

We will definitely be back on our next trip to Solvang!Word to the wise: This is the best place for breakfast in Solvang.... just keep it simple and order the pancakes, you won't be disappointed.",4 star rating,Brittania D.

After years of disappointing breakfasts in town, I finally turned to Yelp, and we will never eat anywhere else again! We'd seen this place several times, but never stayed because of the wait, but now we're glad to say, the wait is well worth it!We both enjoy sitting on the patio and ordering our coffees in togo cups. For me it's all about the danish pancake combo with the homemade sausage and for the hubby he loves his danish omelet!",5 star rating,Crystal C.

3/20/2014,"Baker, CA","Went on a friday for brunch. Initially, we were told we would be having a 45 to 60 minutes wait. They seated us in 30 minutes which was great considering the number of people waiting to be seated. Had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon (it was delicious!) and some fresh squeezed orange juice. The place is a little outdated and small but has a welcoming feel to it. I would recommend this place but don't go when you're very hungry. Average wait time is 45 minutes to an hour.",4 star rating,Doods Q.

2/15/2013,"Pittsburg, CA","I love this place whenever visiting Solvang. The place is so easy to see because of the big sign. It is unique, and always busy even on weekday mornings. They have awesome danish pancakes and belgian waffles, of course. There is a lot of options to choose from, and they are all amazing!!!Those who give this place mediocre reviews do not know what to order from here. Just take the suggestions from the hundreds and hundreds of yelp reviewers that recommend the pancakes. Don't bother getting anything else if this is your first and probably only time you come here. So come early, wait for a few minutes, and order pancakes. They also have an outside eating area, but it gets really really freakin hot in the summer. Otherwise, pretty normal diner, kind of clean, kind of old style, but it fits the profile and you will start your day off as perfect and happy as possible!",5 star rating,Andrew I.
7/11/2013,"Ontario, CA","I came here with family to try their pancakes. We had to wait for 45 minutes because there was a lot of people here for lunch.We ordered the Paula's Special which is pancakes with your choice of Cinnamon Apples, Blueberries or Strawberries with whip cream and maple syrup. We got the Strawberries and whip cream on the side. My family and I shared the pancakes because we were going to go around to try pastries at some of the bakeries near by. The pancakes were light and thin. The strawberries were slightly sweet from the syrup. I wish they gave butter as well because I love butter on my pancakes.Service was alright. There's so many of the workers running around to clean tables, serve people, etc. Even though they had a lot of workers, the service was kind of slow. The restaurant is small. Half of the restaurant is inside and half of it is outside. We sat inside. It was horrible because there was A LOT OF FLIES. There was more than 4 flying and landing on me because we sat near the window and I guess they were trying to get out. The table next to us had the same problem. I can't imagine sitting outside too since there are plants surrounding the restaurant. Overall, food is good but everything else was ok.",3 star rating,Jen C.
11/29/2014,"Riverside, CA","Poor customer service!Our large family has been eating here for years. The food is good, but the customer experience has been getting worse each year. Last time, they refused to sit out party of 10 together, so we had to eat at 2 separate tables. They told us the new owner wouldn't allow them to push the tables together. This morning, we were told there would be a 30-40 min wait to seat our party of 8. We put our name in and politely asked if there was a place to stand inside with our infant, since it was very cold outside. We were told the restaurant prefers guests to wait outside. I get it. They have plenty of customers. It's a tourist town with just a few breakfast places, and if we walk out the door, it's a shorter wait time for someone else. They clearly do not need to rely on customer loyalty. Why would I continue to give them our business, dropping $50 for two people. I've got free breakfast at my hotel. The OJ is fresh. The bacon is excellent. My husband loves the sausage. I love Danish pancakes. I recommend the food, but not the business. They've lost ours for good. It's a shame.",2 star rating,Kristine R.

4/26/2009,"West Covina, CA","My friend and I were visiting from the LA area and we stayed not to far from Santa Barbara, so we decided to head up north about an hour and go to Solvang for breakfast.  Even though I had been to Solvang quite a lot, it wasn't usually for breakfast, so we just drove around and picked this location just for the fact that the crowd out front waiting to get seated.  Thank you crowd is all that we can say.  Both of us ended up eating omlettes and we enjoyed them thoroughly.  We could not stop eating them.  We were so full. I know that we should have had some pancakes, but I personally don't like danish pancakes, so if anything I would have ordered regular pancakes.  They had preserves at the table that were also VERY good.",4 star rating,Grace C.
11/8/2009,"Anaheim Hills, CA","This was my first experience with Danish Pancakes, so I don't know if they were good as far as Danish Pancakes go. But as pancakes in general go I really like the Danish variety. Service was awful and that brings down the review. Our waitress was the most inattentive I have encountered in a long time. We asked for more syrup, we could see the syrup there behind the counter. Rather than handing us syrup, she circled around for a while, then took the order of the party next to us, then went and put the order in the computer, and disappeared into the kitchen for about 15 minutes before handing us the syrup we asked for. Our waitress and every other waitress and busboy passed by my empty water glass for most of the meal, finally I asked the waitress for more water, and she of course filled the glass full of ice with about 1 ounce of water.The flys here come in 2 varieties, the annoying ones buzzing around landing on you, your food and everything else... and the dead ones. We were INSIDE the restaurant, the flys were even worse outside while we were waiting to be seated. I can say that I would not go back to Paula's again. If you choose to go to Paula's I recommend sitting at the counter rather than the hour wait to get a table.",2 star rating,Brian B.
12/19/2009,"Asheville, NC","As everyone else has stated, Paula's boasts the following:Food that's quite good - omelettes, pancakes (regular and Danish), as well as many other breakfast goodies.Large crowds - it's always packed in the A.M.  However, the counter/bar is usually empty, and you get served right away, as there's a server dedicated to that area.Great prices - It's like eating at a diner, only the food is a bit better, and the Danish influence is unique.I recommend you have breakfast here at least one morning during your stay in Solvang; it's a good starting point to go see the other places in town.  Plus, the bakery next door has some excellent Danish pastries!",4 star rating,Steve S.
8/9/2010,"Long Beach, CA","OOOh boy... Man oh Man...there was a lot of love put into the creation of the country gravy with the biscuit that I had here.  It was T-H-E best county gravy I've ever.. ever had.  And you know how you can get a lot of bland country gravy out there.  But don't let me over hip it up, but it was very good!I also ordered the waffles only because I prefer them over pancakes.  It was a thick Belgium style waffle and I had the Dutch sausage, which was mild in flavored and tasted like a bratwurst. Only one issue I have is that the syrup was way too sweet and cheap tasting.  I asked about the syrup and found out it was from a large plastic jug from the supplier they use.  So they badly need to get a better quality syrup, so as to not fuck up the waffle or the pancake experience.Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice: At first I thought that the fresh squeezed orange juice was a scam... but I actually stand corrected.  Mr. Charles G. of  Paula's wrote me and said that, ""We re-use the empty syrup bottles to store our fresh squeezed orange juice.  I guarantee it.""   So my Foodie friend, if you are a suspicious Foodie detective like I can be sometimes, and you happen to see the waitress pour it from the plastic jug with the same restaurant supplier's label as the Maple Leaf Syrup they use ...DON'T WORRY... they said it was actually fresh squeezed on the premises and they are just recycling the bottles.   So I can't really demote them for that can I.I look forward to going there again for breakfast.",3 star rating,Jonah O.

9/10/2007,"Los Angeles, CA","I first had breakfast at Paula's in 1991. I was ten years old. My dad took us to Santa Ynez to visit one of his old friends and we spent the weekend there. We played with their kids and fed the horses. In Solvang we went crazy for the random practical joke store (I think I bought canned fart spray) and we felt like we were in some story book land.Then for Sunday breakfast we went to Paula's; where all the waitresses look like the Swiss Miss girl carrying plates of giant Belgian waffles and super thin Danish pancakes with powdered sugar and mountains of strawberries. I got to order the waffles and a hot chocolate. This place was definitely something out of a story book.It is no wonder, then, that I return to Paula's for breakfast at every chance I get when I'm in the Santa Ynez Valley. Whether it be for a quick wine tasting weekend or passing through on the way up to go camping in San Luis Obispo County, Paula's is an absolute must-stop.When the Danish pancakes arrive at my table, dusted with a generous helping of powdered sugar, it feels like I'm ten years old all over again.",5 star rating,Davey G.

I was on a road trip on the 101 and decided to check it out because of the great yelp reviews.Solvang is only about 3 miles off of the 101.. as soon as you drive into the town, you can find parking pretty easily in front of the restaurant.  If you pass the windmill, you've gone too far.The weather was great.. and thus the wait around 12:30 was at least 15 minutes.  I was super hungry so I decided to eat inside at the bar to avoid the wait.I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice just to try it out.. they have two sizes and the cups are kind of small.. but it's still tasty and enough for one meal.We ordered the veggie omelette and a standard pancake breakfast....it was a very yummy meal but not to the point where I'd go around the world and tell everyone that they need to try it.. Nevertheless I walked away very very pleased with my meal.One thing I would recommend is that the waitresses need to be a little more attentive and happy.. I don't see them smiling!

I had some fresh strawberries on top and my husband had the warm apple compote. The pancakes were very very good. I like how they are made thin so the center is not mushy or soggy. I barely used the pancake syrup it came with since the strawberries already gives it a hint of sweetness. Another plus is the fresh whipped cream that was served along with the fruit. I could immediately tell it was not some kind of Reddi Whip in a can. It was very creamy and I am sure it is made with heavy cream = more calories but it was worth it.We're glad we had breakfast @ Paula's!,4 star rating,Jenny W.

8/5/2012,"Santa Monica, CA","A long continuous line throughout the day means respect. I asked the host how long in advance to put my name on the waiting list and he said it ranges from 30 min to 2 hours. We had a party of 8, so we put it in an hour in advance and were seated in about 40 minutes. Nice guy at the front.As for the service and food, busy place and kind of cramped in there. I'd say that the dutch pancakes although smaller in quantity is the thing to try. 2 large, flat pancakes are much less doughy than American pancakes. The syrup is thinner, but you should get the homemade whipped cream (heavy) and fresh fruit topping. These pancakes are more flavorful than regular pancakes and leave you wanting more. Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but you're in Solvang and they're based on tourism so if you're going to eat, this is one of the few places in the city that ranks above 4 stars in town. It's busy and they don't take reservation, but that's not a bad thing. I'd go back if I were in town again. There are lines for a reason...",4 star rating,Scott A.
7/26/2008,"Concord, CA","Once I arrived at Paula's we were lucky enough to get the last table at 9:00 AM on a Saturday morning.   Within minutes our coffee was served, but getting our food order in was another story.Paula's has more than enough busers to pick up the dishes even more so than waitresses.  Well 11 minutes later our food order was taken.  We ordered the Danish pancakes with Danish sausage and scrambled eggs and the Danish French toast with Danish sausage. Both dishes come covered in powered sugar and maple sugar.   The Danish pancakes were a light and fluffy goodness.  The Danish French toast was very light and just melted in your mouth.  The Danish sausage was pretty large and very tasty.  It was perfectly cooked and the knife just went through it like it was bread.  I would eat here again, but I do have to find someplace new to eat everyday.",4 star rating,Chris G.
1/30/2009,"Sunnyvale, CA","Paula's is the BEST pancake house EVER!! This year alone I think I've been there about 5 or so times (I live about 4 hours away). The pancakes are just SUPER yum!! They are a lot lighter than eating regular buttermilk pancakes. Whenever I make my stop at Paula's, I get the Danish pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream, and a side of corned beef hash. Their whipped cream is really good, they make it themselves. And I don't know what it is about their corned beef hash, but I can't seem to get enough! :D Weekends aren't exactly the best times to go to Paula's since you'll end up waiting in a line that will take about 20-30 minutes. If you can make it during the week that would be best. But I don't mind waiting in line because the pancakes make the wait worth it, gives you more room in your tummy!",5 star rating,Holly L.

It's a huge breakfast menu with lots of pancake and waffle favorites, but also tons of egg dishes for protein lovers like me.  The California omelette with egg whites was killer, and their bacon is huge and perfectly crispy.  Will definitely go back (if we can get up early enough to get in there!)",5 star rating,Rachel S.

1/7/2013,"Alhambra, CA",Seems like this is the most popular breakfast place in Solvang for Danish pancakes so we had to try it. It was nearly an hour wait for a large table. The restaurant itself is small but there is also a lot of patio seating. We ordered:- Paula's special of Danish pancakes topped with strawberries and whipped cream ($8.75): my favorite. Pancakes were thin and crepe-like. - Danish pancake combination ($9.95): pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage. Not bad but the pancakes tasted better sweet rather than savory. - Eggs Benedict ($10.95): came with ham and tomato. It was good. - California special omelette ($10.95): small omelette with chiles and cheese cooked onto it and avocado on top. There was sour cream and bland salsa on the side. This was a really sad omelette. Definitely do not recommend. - half chicken salad sandwich with a cup of vegetable soup ($8.25): I didn't try it but the dish did not look appealing. Overall cute little shop but the food is just ok. Not really worth waiting for but maybe this is the best food in the area? Stick with the pancakes. The other items that we tried weren't very good.,3 star rating,Karen T.

Our group tried the salmon benedict, Danish pancake special, warning they do not have Aebleskiver :((((  and the Paula's Special which was the warm apple cinnamon pancakes (which was the best from everything we had.)

7/10/2014,"Gardena, CA",Danish pancakes and sausage are excellent. Orange juice is fresh and their omelets are delicious. Now for the service...the waitress took for ever to serve us. The place was busy but they had about  at least 12 servers and bussers so to me that's not an excuse. When the food came out they forgot about my side of eggs. The waitress was nowhere to be found for about almost 20 mins. I had to get up and go near the kitchen and tell another waitress about my missing order. Finally our waitress came over and she didn't get the memo so I had to remind her. This place is quaint and adds to your enjoyable Solvang experience with it's authentic Danish breakfast but there were some things that should be addressed that shouldn't be allowed to slide by for a 4 star restaurant.  There was actually one more thing that I won't mention because I don't want to be mean even though I've said a lot that if it's not fixed I'm sure will be addressed by someone else.,3 star rating,Jose Marcy P.

I get the restaurant holding on to the old fashioned/old school decor, but the bathroom really needs an update! The linoleum was old and cracking in some places, and then the mirror had this scary green stuff growing on the bottom of it. Yuck! Our food was ok; however, during the entire meal, I was swatting flies away bc they had the door open. (There was a waitress walking around with a fly swatted; it was that bad) and then about 10 minutes after we had gotten our food, our waitress places our check on the table with a, ""no rush, just when you are ready.""

8/14/2015,"San Fernando, CA","For the short time were were in Solvang this place was probably the closest to majority of hotels on Mission Blvd.  This is probably why this place is so busy, you will wait at least 30 minutes.   Con:  If you sit outside you are going to be next to several people waiting to be seated, I don't like people hovering over me when I eat.   Also, next to the main road where big rigs and a lot of car exhaust and the lovely smokers who think by smoking on the sidewalk near the restaurant won't make it's way to the outside eating area.Con:  30 minute-45 wait timeCon:  Small restroom and right next to the server area, servers were a little bitchy and would brush by you.Con:  Not the best service because place was so busy.    Con:  Place does not know how to cook an egg over easy, they gave everyone over hard.  Since it took a while for our food I decided just to eat the egg.   Pro:  Breakfast wasn't bad, the danish pancakes were delicious.   So if the place isn't that busy we probably would have had a better experience?  Maybe?",2 star rating,Kelly A.
4/13/2014,"Munich, Germany","They say the more crowd you see, chances are you want to see what the fuss is all about. Heaps of people were standing outside of Paula's, so of course I wanted to see if they were as good if people were willing to wait up to an hour to dine. Clearly its a sign of excellence, but unfortunately, Paula's Pancake House was just nothing but the ordinary to me. There was quite a long wait - approximately 45 minutes for us at about 1pm (& on a weekend). Because it was more than a perfect day out, we opted to dine outdoors (I always prefer it that way). It appears that the Danish pancake is the highlight of what makes Paula's to be infamous in Slovang, but I really wanted a strawberry waffle so I asked for one that also came with eggs + a sausage cake. I really like waffles, but it seemed just ordinary to me, and was much lighter than what I'm used to (the thick fluffy ones).

7/6/2014,"Long Beach, CA","After eating at Paula's for 20+ years I can't believe I have not reviewed Paula's on Yelp yet.First, my suggestion is to get there by 7am or so regardless of the day of week if you want to be seated right away, inside or outside. It seems that 8am is the time when everyone staying in town or in nearby communities come out to eat. Unfortunately no reservations are taken until morning the day of your visit. Paula's is easily the busiest breakfast stop in town, partially because of its convenient location but fully because of the terrific food. Having eaten there on the 4th of July morning this year (only open until 3 year round) a quick walk around town after breakfast revealed only a very few diners in the many other breakfast spots, but as we walked back by Paula's there had to have been 20-30 people waiting for a table. This would have been a bit after 8. The coffee is always good, better than average, orange juice is fresh squeezed (you can see the machine right there in the dining room), and both Belgian waffles and particularly the Danish pancakes are delicious. The other reviewer was right, they are as large as or larger around than a soccer ball; thin, slightly sweet, and come two to an order. I chose the combo this time with Medisterpolse (Danish sausage with the flavors of allspice and cloves) and two eggs. The cost was $10.25 and I could not finish the pancakes there was so much food. In the past I have also enjoyed their toast, hash brown potatoes, and omelettes.

1/16/2013,"Las Vegas, NV","My trip to Solvang was so random. I was visiting my friend in Santa Barbara, and we woke up Sunday morning trying to decide where we would go for brunch. My friend mentioned that there was this place they had wanted to try in Solvang, which is 45 minutes away. I looked it up on Yelp, and saw that there is usually a wait to be seated. I was already hungry and didnt want to do a hour drive and then still have to wait. So I called Paula's to see if I could make a reservation, they said they couldnt make a reservation but they could put me on the list, so we put our name on the list and told them we would be there around 11a.We arrive in Solvang and found a parking spot on the street next to a burger stand. We arrived at Paulas at like 11:10a. We went up to the door guy and asked if they called our name yet. They hadnt called our name yet, and we called at 9:50a!!!! They guy told us we would be seated in 5 minutes. Finally we were seated 15-20 minutes later. We were seated at an outside table, so I never saw what the restaurant looked like inside.I ordered a Mimosa with the Danish Pancake Combination, with bacon and eggs scrambled with cheese. My friend ordered an apple juice with a waffle with strawberries on top and a Danish Sausage on the side. All of my food was tasty and satisfying. My friend enjoyed their meal as well.

1/27/2015,"San Gabriel, CA","Of all the restaurants I ate at in Solvang, this was the best / my favorite.The food was delicious-- we got the Eggs Benedict, Corn Beef Hash, and Paula's Pancakes with fresh strawberries to share between 3 people and it was the perfect amount.The eggs benedict and corn beef hash were pretty standard, but like a ""you know this is good brunch food, standard.""  The Danish pancakes were really good!  Kind of like a crepe made with pancake batter, yumyum!Service was pretty mediocre and rude though. :(The other reason I deducted a star  is because I had to call 3 times to get a ""reservation"" for 10 guests.  The week prior to our arrival, I had called to try to make sure they would be able to accommodate us--I was told that I would need to call when they opened at 6:00am Saturday morning.  I WAKE UP EARLY TO CALL, and the lady tells me she is unable to take any names down because the hostess has not arrived yet--and won't be until 8:00am.  I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A RESERVATION FOR 8:00AM.  Then she proceeds to tell me to call back at 7:30am... so I do, and the lady (who doesn't really speak English) just says that they don't take reservations on Weekends.  I understood that, but was told that because we had a large party we needed to give them notice in advance (RESERVE the space).  After being transferred to someone else and telling her the 3 different responses I received, she reluctantly took my name down and put me on the waiting list.This place needs to have better and more consistent management--but would still come back for delicious breakfast.",3 star rating,Maggie L.

11/27/2012,"San Mateo, CA","The ""Danish sausage"" tastes exactly like Ikea meatballs. That's not a knock - I LOVE Ikea's super cheap meatball meal! It's more of an FYI if you can't decide that you need it or not.The pancakes were fine,  solid 2.5-star-take-it-or-leave-it fare. I don't know if I've just been fortunate to have ONLY ever eaten fantastic pancakes so I am underestimating their worth, but I'm guessing that they are just OK with a side of touristy goodness.On the topic of touristy - I would be utterly shocked if this place was so highly reviewed if it was in a random neighborhood anywhere else. The service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either. We happened to go when it wasn't very busy (didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes to be seated). I didn't mind that I had to sit where the sun was beaming directly into my eye, but our server was trying to hurry us along as if there was a mob of people waiting to be seated. She also had the same old lame response when we asked about what she liked on the menu: 'everything is good here.' Really? EVERYTHING?!? Not one thing stands out as better than anything else? That's amazing!In the end the food was OK, the service left something to be desired and I would pass on the price. No doubt this place has so many people that they never plan on seeing again that service is not a top priority.",3 star rating,André E.
2/26/2012,"Foothill Ranch, CA","We were in Solvang for the weekend and decided to try Paula's Pancake House for breakfast before hitting the road. My husband went inside and asked if we could sit on the patio with our dog. ""No problem,"" was the hostess' response. We were seated by the hostess, our orders taken by the waitress, coffee was served by another waitress, and then someone else from Paula's came up to us and said we can't sit on the patio with the dog and needed to leave. Look, I am fine with restaurants  choosing not to allow dogs on their patio if they prefer, but maybe everyone on the staff should be aware of that rule so that guests don't have to go through being awkwardly kicked out after being told it was ok. Paula's needs to get all their employees on the same page about their policies. Solvang is a dog-friendly town, so I'm sure they've had people ask to have their dogs on the patio before. If their rule is ""no dogs,"" be clear about it with the staff and save the visitors the grief.On the bright side, the two sips of coffee I had tasted good.",1 star rating,Dana M.
10/19/2015,"Raleigh, NC","This place was such a disappointment and definitely not worth the wait time! The danish pancakes were just ""okay"" and nothing special. The orange juice was warm and sour.

5/14/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Wow. I've been here before, but I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet. We went on Mother's Day WITHOUT our Mother's. It was just a coincidence, but it created an hour-long wait. Looks like everyone wanted to get up in Paula's Pancakes. Since it was past noon, I wasn't really feeling the pancakes to be honest, so I opted for the California Special. A good choice - it came with two sides (I chose toast and has browns). The side of bacon is also worth trying. The bacon is crisp and thick - which always leads to awesomeness. All in all, if you're in Solvang, or just passing through, Paula's is a yummy, accommodating breakfast or lunch place. Plus, the guy who led us into the restaurant reminded everyone of the lead character from Office Space. You know, the one who gets hypnotized and doesn't give a shit (in a good way)? He was so mellow. I wanted to hug him.",4 star rating,Eva K.

Wow, we were shocked. After waiting 50 min we decided not to wait any longer to be possibly abused by this guy ( I had some coffee from next door). He told us "" well that's silly""!

7/8/2014,"Arcadia, CA","Came here saturday  over the three days Fourth of July weekend around noon with a large party (14).  I told the host that we can split up the party as he sees fit (basically, just get us in).  He told us our table would be readied 20 to 30 minutes.  After half and hour later, he told us that he is getting our tables readied.  Then, in 45 minutes later he told us that the existing patrons are paying.   Well, close to an hour, kids in our party were thirsty and hungry so I asked if a portion of our party can be seated.  He said he could seat 9 of us.  So, I got the kids and some of the adults in.  The party of 9 were actually split up into two separate round tables for party of 5 and 4.  I noticed that a table of 7 were just seated minutes before us (that party came way after us).  What the heck is going on?  Anyhow, the third table for the remaining 5 adults was not ready at all.  About 5 minutes in, I asked the servers if we can take the table in the other section that is readied.  So, we ended up seated in two different dining rooms.The Danish pancakes tasted great, as well as the danish sausage.  But is it that great for an hour wait (due to the overly ""stupid"" host; who was a bit of a jerk to the waitress)?  Absolutely not.Food:  A-Service:  BHost:  D-Oh, I forgot to mention that it was so hot and stuffy inside the restaurant; the owner should invest in air conditioning if one does not exist.  If air conditioning is there, then turn it on.",3 star rating,Steve H.

The food is just ok. Service was not that great at all. We were the lucky couple that got tucked in the corner and forgotten about. Price is pretty fair.

5/12/2012,"Singapore, Singapore","I was on a 3D2N tour from LA to SF. We were given 2.5 hours of free time in Solvang to explore the place and have lunch. Being a massive yelper, I yelped for a brunch place in Solvang (native Cali friend told me that there was a good pancake place here) ... and found Paula's Pancake House!I was told by the immensely friendly host that our wait for a table of 4 would take around an hour to an hour and a half! It was Saturday 10am. There were so many people waiting outside of the diner (there was a marathon held in Solvang that morning). I was so sure the food would be so worth the wait ... And decided to forsake exploring Solvang for quality brunch. A few parties before us left before their turn ... And our wait ended up being only an hour! Yippee~What we ordered:(1) Danish omelette (Danish sausages within) with fruit bowl - this omelette was solid! The sausages were so smoky! There was a generous cheese layer covering the omelette. So delish!(2) Eggs Benedict with hash brown - the eggs benedict was really good! The hash brown was divine - it was Scandinavian-style hash - thin potato strips fried in patty form!(3) French toasts - there were very standard French toasts (no caramel or fancy fruit toppings) but with the maple syrup dressing them, they were simply appetizing!(4) Paula's pancakes with blueberry toppings! Ahhhhh ... So awesomely great! The pancakes were flatter (more crepe-like) than the typical American pancakes. The intact blueberries were coated in a sweet syrup ... Served as very fresh pseudo blueberry jam with the Danish pancakes. Favourite brunch dish of all!We left feeling awesomely contented! I even shook the hands of the host to thank him for such a delightful brunch experience! *happiness*",5 star rating,Yibing Q.
1/5/2013,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA","So so so so good! I didn't try anything else on the menu besides the Danish Pancakes, but seriously, one of the best things I've ever tasted. The pancake is like a hybrid of a pancake and a crepe, but tastes so bombtastic!The pancake was thinner than typical pancakes, made very soft yet a hint of crunchiness on the outside. The taste was very buttery and sweet, but to the right amount. I felt like I was eating a flavored cloud. The house whipped cream that went with the pancake was absolutely delicious. Thick, rich and creamy, but not overwhelmingly sweet - just the way I like it. I pretty much downed an entire cup of whipped cream (definitely hit the gym after that) but it was totally worth it.",5 star rating,Sherry J.

Finally, we also spent almost 10 minutes to find the lady again because when we asked other waitresses for helps, they always told us they would find the lady for us. When we got the check, we found that two of my friends got two small size drink, and we checked to another waitress cuz we cannot find ours. Another one said the check had problem but the lady came to us later and pointed to the two small cups and told us those were big size. She said she didn't charge us more.

Carbs - and this much of it - so early in the morning just doesn't sound like a fun thing...This place is ADORABLE, and fits in just fine with the rest of Solvang...cute. The waitresses are dressed in ethnic costumes and are very nice, but sometimes seem like they don't know what they are doing. We were seated quickly and scanned the menu as well as what the other patrons were ordering and it seemed like everyone was ordering the pancakes, so we followed suit. About 15 minutes later or orders came out...the Other Yelper and I got pretty much the same thing - Paula's Special, but his came with bacon and one egg. Even though I'm not much of a pancake person, I have to admit that this pancake was pretty darn good. It wasn't bready and thick like most pancakes, but light and fluffy. Spread out thin, the pancake didn't seem as heavy as it normally does, but that could be because I was only thinking about the fresh made whipped cream! The warm apple and whipped cream combo was so good that I forgot to add syrup and it was completely fine.I don't really know what it's like with a wait, but I'm sure it would be kinda horrible. Personally, based on what I've read and experienced, I would not wait for this place if it was more than a 30 minute wait. Next time we come through, I'll have to try the omelettes... at Paula's PANCAKE House. Oh well, I'm a rebel!",4 star rating,Linda C.
6/2/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","When in Rome.....So stopping by solvang on our way up north.  Of course we have to try the Danish pancakes.  Delicious.  The decor is awesome, some might say touristy with the waitresses dressed up Danish outfits, but I say it adds to ambiance of Solvang.  We also ordered the corned beef hash.  It was pretty damn good fell in love with it.  Always looking for an excuse to go up north just to stop by Paula's for breakfast",5 star rating,Phillip V.
3/20/2012,"Orange County, CA","It was a little bit of a long wait to get a table but it was definitely worth it.  Like everyone else recommends, get the Paula's Special.  Two big thin pancakes with fresh whipped cream.  It was delicious.  I also had the shrimp omelette and really enjoyed it.  My husband ordered the steak and eggs and he liked his dish too.  The portions are huge.  Everything tasted great.  Service was friendly and fast.  You MUST go here if you're in Solvang.",4 star rating,Kim T.
3/22/2012,"Hacienda Heights, CA","One of the most popular places in Solvang.  Came here for brunch and there were about 20 people waiting to be seated.  We were very fortunate to only have waited 5 minutes.  Parties of 1-2 get seated right away (and usually at the bar).  The menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming to decide on one thing.  I figured I couldn't go wrong with the pancakes since the resturant is called a pancake house.  The Danish style pancakes are large, thin and go well with fruits.  I had the Paula's Special with all the fruits and it was verry fluffy considering it was thin (paradox, i know). This place would be great if you could come with a few people and order a variety of items off of the menu to share, with the pancake as one of them naturally.  The atmosphere is very cozy and cliche, since all the workers where Danish outfits.  (What can you expect from a city that banks on the Danish theme?)Paula's Pancake Special $8.75",4 star rating,eileen h.

We ordered fresh ground coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, an order of Danish pancakes with fresh strawberries and an order of Danish pancakes with cinnamon apples both with whip cream(which tasted fresh whipped), bacon and Danish sausage. The food came out very quickly, probably within 10 minutes of ordering. Everything was very good! Danish sausage was not exactly what I was expecting, but wasn't bad. Probably would just go with bacon next time though. It was good mixed with the syrup. The staff was all very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place fore breakfast.",4 star rating,Cassie N.

9/2/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Can't miss this place. It's the one with the crowd outside. Went here the Saturday of Labor Day weekend around 9-930am. The wait ended up being 45 mins- 1 hour for us. When we got seated, I heard the host say it was going to be 1 hr and 25 mins wait.  This is my first time here and ordered the Danish Pancakes that everyone is raving about. Don't let the thinness fool you. With all the food you get, it's a pretty filling meal. True, they are delicious, but I also (surprisingly) really liked the sausage! I usually don't get sausage (that's saying a lot)  but this one has great flavor to it. Food came out quick and service is friendly. Love the outside patio, but you may need to fight off a couple of flies to eat your food. The food is awesomely priced.If you're not pressed for time or starving, this would be a good place to check out if you're in the area. Consider it a leisurely morning. Put your name down, grab some tea/coffee, walk around and come back. It'd be really helpful if the host took your name and called the cell phone, but, alas, a girl can dream.",4 star rating,Charisse R.

While we were eating there was a guy inside killing flies with a fly swatter and just leaving about 6 dead flies in the window sill. Ew! Also the service was terrible the waitress didn't fill our drinks not one time while we were there. She also said a snyde comment to my boyfriend when he asked for more syrup.. I saw that this place received great reviews and I was confused... I have no idea why people like this place so much.",2 star rating,Heather D.

We were there for breakfast and there were at least 10 waitresses but they were standing around much of the time talking to each other and not serving the guests. One waitress was standing drinking coffee but we had to flag down a waitress to request a refill. Although the food was good we will try a different restaurant for breakfast next time where we can receive better service. We never had any one consistent waitress.,3 star rating,Pete W.

Good thing we got here early because the place was already 85% full!We ordered Paula's Special (Danish pancakes) with blueberries and the California Special omelette with Danish sausage. The Danish pancakes are thin yet fluffy. It's not your ordinary pancake so it's a must try. What can I say about the omelette? It didn't blow me away, but it wasn't bad either. I have to say the Danish sausage was interesting. It had the texture of a hot dog, but more flavorful. I wouldn't miss it if they left it out of the omelette though.",4 star rating,Lorraine G.

We both ordered the Danish pancakes filled with Danish sausage. It was a filling dish and pretty good. I can't say that I'd wait that long again but I'd go again if there wasn't a crowd.Pro: Despite the long wait to get seated, once we did get seated, the food came quick.

Maybe we should have gotten pancakes, but we chose soup, sandwich, bowl of chili.  Very plain, not much flavor, it was okay, definately do-able but nothing to rave about.  All of the food we ordered were not flavored well, no seasoning to them at all. I will be back to Solvang soon again, but I won't be back to this place. However, the atmosphere, the waitresses traditional outfits - adorable.",3 star rating,PY P.

We waited about 20 minutes and perused the menu while we waited to be seated. I already knew what I wanted: I had to try the danish pancakes with a Swedish sausage and I am so glad that I did because the pancakes were light and fluffy and the sausage was juicy with a little kick of spice!! YUMM-O!! The waitress even suggested that we add the fresh strawberries and whipped cream and emphasized that it was home-made cream...so why not!!!OH and the orange juice was fabulous... I want some right now!! It was freshly squeezed with alot of pulp and just the write amount of citrus goodness. My friend had the eggs benedict ...interesting presentation of the eggs by the way.

To be honest a 3 1/2 star rating would be better.  The signature dishes seem to be the Danish pancakes they were very good but not spectacular. Only complaint I had was the coffee was slow coming to the table and I had to ask for refills. Staff was friendly but maybe a little disorganized.

Paula's is immediately on the left side when coming into town so don't pass it up. You will see its busy, but don't fret it moves pretty quickly so you will get in. I like the ambiance of dining on the outside patio or If you prefer inside its like a little country kitchen.  The Danish pancakes are popular at around $9.00 and we also had a side of thick cut bacon. Very yummy. They also have all the standard breakfast and lunch items. The service is good, staff is friendly, food is very good and prices very affordable.  Always looking forward to going to Paula's.",5 star rating,Michelle B.

That got very expensive. The coffee was probably THE worst coffee ever! How do you mess up coffee. The servers are hit or miss. The one that sat us was so rude! Our waitress wasn't too bright but sweet. She went to lunch so another waitress finished our meal. That one was out in space somewhere.

I think we ended up waiting maybe 30 minutes or so - it was a Sunday morning and very busy.Everyone in our group seemed to enjoy their food. I hate normal pancakes, but per a recommendation I ordered the Danish pancakes - they were light and fluffy and very good. I got the combo with danish sausage and eggs; the scrambled eggs were a little runny, although I didn't specify, and I didn't care for the danish sausage (it had a minty flavor that I found very weird). Our waitress wasn't very enthused about serving us, but did a great job with our orders and checked up on us just often enough that we got what we needed without it being annoying. The gentleman who was taking names at the front (not sure if it was a manager or not) came to check on us once as well. We were all starving, and after the initial wait to get seated, the food did come out relatively quickly. Minus a star because there were flies everywhere inside, and they couldn't accommodate a large group at one table.Would return here, especially if it was a smaller group and at a time of year when the flies aren't out.",4 star rating,Kat S.

It has been in my experience that places with the biggest crowds usually have really good food. If you can manage to get a seat on the patio, do it. It is very nice out there. But sitting inside is also good. I always come here for the Pancakes. I mean, you can't NOT get pancakes when you're at a place called ""Paula's Pancake House"" right? I have always enjoyed these while I have been here. If you are feeling extra adventurous, order up a good Danish beer like ""Carlsburg"" to wash it all down.

They have a nice outdoor area where you can eat and look out at the main street in Solvang, or their little indoor area which is nice as well, not too loud and not too quiet. The food averages about $10 a person, they have giant Danish pancakes which are delicious and giant omelettes which I recommend. Their bacon is a little on the salty side, so make sure you have a giant glass of water afterwards. My boyfriend got the eggs benedict said it was delicious.

We were expecting to wait for a table of 6 on Sunday morning, but they told us it would be 30 minutes, ended up being an hour, and they didn't even apologize. The food was **REALLY GOOD**.

It's crazy busy at all times, but when it comes to breakfast, they hook it up like that pirate from Peter Pan.Their omelettes made me weak in the knees. I fell to the floor and remained there for at least 3 minutes before a fellow patron picked me up and returned me to my seat. I recommend the kind with the sausage. I can't remember what kind of sausage it is. I might not be able to pronounce it, but I'm sure your server can.Also get a Danish pancake. They're the kind of pancakes that will take you out for a night on the town and generously pay your cabfare home. What a pancake!Delicious food, fast service despite the significant wait, and the unmistakable ghostly scent of Paula, the wandering paranormal pancake. Can't recommend it enough.",5 star rating,Ef R.

The trick is to arrive at 7 AM and bypass the lines and wait. You will be seated in a heart beat. This famous breakfast spot is known for the killer good breakfast, which truly are fantastic. I am a fan of Paula's Danish pancake combo. Eggs sunny side up, Danish sausage, and the famous Danish pancakes, are what makes this American-Danish restaurant so good.

12/20/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","The waitress agreed that she hadn't seen anyone scarf down two plates of food as quickly as I did before. I had been creepin on pictures of this place the night before, and I was so excited to wake up in the morning to get my pancake on. My mom and I got to Paula's at about 12:30, and the place was packed. It took about 20 minutes to be seated, and about 15 more for our food to be served. My mom said she wasn't that hungry, so I ordered for her, and I got Paula's special (2 thin Danish pancakes with fresh whipped cream and strawberries) and an order of eggs benedict (I'm a sucker for eggs benedict).The pancakes were divine. At breakfast joints, waffles are my go-to, but these pancakes are something else. I didn't need a knife to slice them up. I just used my fork and tore away at the thing. I tried to get some whipped cream, a slice of strawberry, and some pancake on my fork each bite. Sometimes I would get a little carried away and dip my bite into some maple syrup, but that's wholly unnecessary. The pancakes are good just on their own. The eggs benedict was great too, but I just wish the hollandaise had more flavor. However, the eggs were poached with love, and the hash browns that came with the benedict had a perfectly crispy crust, and the potatoes were tender. Paula's was a big surprise. My mom actually hates breakfast places. She can't stand pancakes and waffles and syrup and all the quintessential breakfast items. I have never seen that woman actually enjoy a stack of pancakes until Paula's, and for that, this place has my heart... and pancake devotion.",5 star rating,Jessica K.

8/15/2011,"Fontana, CA","I've eaten at Paula's Pancake House a total of 3 times. The first time, the novelty of Danish pancakes made me think that they were awesome, but now that I've had them more than once, they are just okay. It's certainly better than a Denny's, IHOP, etc., but not awesome. That this place is voted one of the best restaurants in Solvang is meaningless in such a place. There are really no great places to eat in this small, cutesy town, so places like Paula's seem much better than they actually are. If you don't come early in the morning, be prepared to wait.The Danish pancakes are good, but to me, they're like really flat pancakes that one can make at home - the reason I say this is because they tasted no different than the pancakes I make using store-bought batter mix. The bacon has been both kinda soggy and crispy, so it's really hit or miss. The hash browns are okay - I love potatoes, so you really can't mess those up. The scrambled eggs are just eggs.I've also had their veggie omelet with hollandaise sauce added and that was quite tasty. It comes with hash browns or fruit as well as toast. Best meal I had here, but nothing mind-blowing by any means.The service has always been great though. The waitresses are on it despite the busyness of the place. Worth a visit to see what's up, but nothing to write home about.",3 star rating,Maribel M.

On our way from LA we were yelping bakeries in the area and we saw the rave reviews of Paula's, so we stopped by. When we arrived, we saw the many patrons overflowing the patio of the restaurant waiting for a table (which was expected). The host told us it was going to be about a 30 min wait. As we waited, we could hear our stomachs growling so we ended up forfeiting our table and going straight to the benches at the counter.Service was super quick. We ordered two Paula's Special, a side of hash browns and orange juice. The juice was freshly squeezed, something I haven't had in a while. Once our food came out, we realized we didn't order Grand Slams at Denny's. The pancakes were huge and smothered with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.

Mind you, we still hadn't ordered.  If I wasn't feeling so faint from standing and waiting in the heat of the day for so long I would have gotten up and left.  I ordered the Danish Pancakes with fresh strawberries and my husband ordered eggs benedict and the danish sausage on the side to try.  Someone else brought the food, and on the plate was some whipped cream and the strawberries, but no syrup, when our waitress finally came over, I asked for some syrup and she gave me a rude look, so I asked, are you not supposed to put syrup on a ""danish"" pancake and she gave me some lame answer ""well if it is served with whipped cream, that is already sweet, so you don't need syrup"".  Now I see photographs all over this yelp page with both syrup and whipped cream on the plate.  Then to top it off, she brought back the syrup and put the check down, and smart allecky said, ""No Rush"", I mean how rude, I barely had started to eat.  I try to be understanding when a place is busy, but the wait staff should be more appreciative to their customers, she never apologized, and kept answering me with a fake over the top ""You're Welcome!""  I will never go back!  My friends on the other had who sat at the other table inside had a wonderful experience and enjoyed it.  So go figure.  My husband liked his breakfast, mine was just average as it gets.",1 star rating,Laura L.

I know you've rated things as orgasmic before, but THIS is orgasmic. You don't even need syrup, that's how good it is.""....he doesn't know I just typed all that while he was talking.Essentially, I agree with him on all accounts. The Danish pancakes are ridiculously good. They're thin almost like a crepe consistency, but not QUITE that thin. You can choose between blueberries, strawberries, or apple cinnamon topping..or you can pay an extra $2 bucks and get all three. My fiancee recommends the warm apple cinnamon.Last time we went I went with the California omlett. It was like a tex-Mex omlett with avocado, salsa, etc. It was delicious. Healthy portion of avocado which I appreciated. Every time we go get the the ""mimosa for 2"" special because their fresh squeezed orange juice is heavenly and they bring out this cute little mini bottle of champagne to split. It's funny to review this place. I remember the first time I went here I was about 8 years old and I was on a trip with my best friend's family. They took us here and 15 years later when I went back to Solvang I still remembered it! I've now been with my fiance twice in the past year or 2 and he is absolutely DEDICATED to it! He would eat there every day if he could...too bad we live 3.5 hours away! :-/There's absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. The breakfast is heavenly.

Even if you don't really like pancakes generally (I don't), danish pancakes are hawt. But I came here and also Ellen's in Buellton (see review, 6 stars!) and I'd strongly recommend visiting there instead if you can only go to one. Paula's has a great location and carries out the theme well with the danish architecture and little outfits for the waitresses. It feels a little touristy (it is) but what makes it inferior to Ellen's is just that the food isn't quite as good. My pancakes were cooked just a minute too long and I was missing the homemade raspberry jam that I had fallen in serious love with at Ellen's.

The area is a very very very touristy area and there were lots of tourists hitting this place, so I guess it is a ""must go"" place for most tourists that stop by here. Great outdoor patio, awesome food, and efficient customer service. It really is a perfect brunch place like most of other yelpers have described.",5 star rating,Cassandra S Y.
4/17/2007,"San Dimas, CA","I live in Los Angeles and I go to this place any chance I get!  Nevermind the 2 hours-and-then-some drive -- I gots to get me some of those strawberry waffles!This place isn't known for their waffles; most people flock here for the Danish pancakes (which also happen to be very good, by the way), but I'm a soft-and-crunchy kinda gal, so I go for the waffles.  Those things make my mouth water with fresh slices of strawberries and homemade whipped cream.  It's the perfect combination of sweet and fluffy with enough crisp on the outside of the waffle to keep me happy.Yes, this means that the waffles are good and you should try it!The staff is friendly, naturally.  The little Danish outfits (with matching aprons, of course!) are endearing and appropriate, considering Solvang is the Danish capital of America.My two gripes about the  place: (1) It is too far away from me!  :o(  So far that I can't get there every morning for a yummy breakfast, but I suppose that this is really a good thing since I would probably be mistaken for a baby whale if this place were easily accessible to me (Waffles aren't exactly the healthiest breakfast food). So, minus 1/2 of a star for that.Gripe numero 2:  If you don't get there early, you would probably end up waiting outside for a while.  People flock to this place!  I guess you can't really blame those folks; Paula's Pancake House does have mouthwatering food.  So, minus another 1/2 star for that.Grand total rating: 4 stars out of 5In addition to being pleasingly edible, the food is also quite affordable.  The staff is quite helpful and nice as well.  Definitely try this place out if you're in Solvang.",4 star rating,Aleli C.

It had lettuce, cabbage, bacon, egg, and chicken.  I also had the poppy seed dressing instead of bleu cheese  or ranch and it was great.  The other reviewers are correct about the quick table turnover time. Service was spot on too. The line gets pretty outrageous so either get there when the sun comes up or go after the lunch rush.  I'm not a morning person so I headed over around 2 (they close at 3)  but we were done eating around 2:30 because the food came out almost as soon and the order was taken.",4 star rating,Soo K.

The freshly squeezed OJ was so amazingly good!!  And I had the Danish pancakes with cinnamon apple and it was wonderful. It came with lots of whip cream and a light syrup that was not so sticky and sweet, which I thought was great. Had a side of the Danish sausage which was tasty and a side of hash browns, which was meh. The service was not the best nor worst. By the time my side orders came I was almost done with my pancakes. And it took forever for the waitress to come back so I could ask about the sides. Then when I did her response was, ""Oh you still don't have them"". Duh, but I could tell it was her fault cause it was waiting at the counter for pick up and cold by the time I finally got it.

Well, she brings me my order and says ""they made a mistake and your sunny side up eggs are on his plate"". And she walks away!!! Are you kidding me!? The fact that it was my husband makes it a tad bit ok. What if I was there with a co-worker or a guest I was taking out to breakfast! How gross would that be! ""Umm could you slide over my egg that's on your plate"". Anyway as my husband tried to carefully transfer the ""sunny side up egg"" guess what happened!!!? Fell apart everywhere of course and was not edible. I had to literally interrupt her conversation with ""Josh Duhamel"" to order another sunny side up egg. Cutting this short...she forgot my order and after a long wait my egg finally came and it was cold. I ate it anyway. She didn't even deduct the item. Her full attention was on that actors table.

I've only been here once but can't forget it and am yearning to go back.The Danish pancakes are just fabuloso. They are light, yet huge. Kinda like a border between a pancake and a crepe. The bacon is thick and meaty unlike your typical thin shriveled things u find at most restaurants. The sausage is no joke either. U actually get a dinner-sized sausage! not some Jimmy Dean-looking thing! (keep mind out of gutter! i'm talking food here!) The whipped cream is fresh and hot chocolate is yummy. And i believe the jam is homemade too. The place gets packed w/ a long wait. But it's so worth the drive from LA and beyond just to get to those scrumptious pancakes!

I was leaving town on a Sunday morning and it was packed!  Unlike other reviewers, I do not see overcrowding as a bad thing.  This shows the food is great and the service fast and I was not disappointed. [Tip:  If a restaurant is EMPTY, that's when you worry!]Paula's is known as a breakfast and lunch house with a varied menu of Danish and American breakfast items.  Sadly I did not get the pancakes though they looked good with strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  Maybe next time! I ordered the Danish omelette with little chopped Danish sausages.  As with my Red Viking experience, the sausages were strongly reminiscent of German sausages I've had.  Very tasty.  And since I love catchup on my eggs, that made the tomato-ish taste with the meat especially enjoyable. The properly prepared hash browns were not crunchy or hard, but soft and chewy in a good way.  The side order of biscuits was really tasty too with butter!Service:  Yeah, there were crowds.  Get used to it.  Allow at least an hour on Sunday mornings since the place is very popular.  Many used the wait to go shopping. There are plenty of museums and sites to see while waiting.  The wait staff was fast and friendly and I did not feel rushed to clear my table despite the people pouring in.It is said 800 people a day are served at Paula's.  And I believe it!  Highly recommended.",5 star rating,James M.

These things were amazing. They are light but fluffy and have a wonderful flavor to them. I didn't jazz them up with anything but you can order them with fruit and other stuff. Our waitress was really nice and attentive with frequent trips back to refill my coffee cup. I would love to go back and have more of their wonderful yummy pancakes.

I just missed the Centennial celebration for the Danish town. This restaurant is next to the best bakery in Solvang (Olsen's) and with a 4-star yelp review, we had to give it a try. There is not too much to comment on the interior decoration of this particular place since the town itself makes you feel like very welcomed and staying here forever. Waitresses dressed in traditional blue and white outfits with white tennis shoes are generous with smiles. I ordered the famous BIG-and-thin-as-claimed pancake combo (with ham steak) and my friend had a tuna melt. They serve perhaps the largest pancake I have ever had and it was good. It's thinner than the thin-crust pizza and melts in your mouth. For around $10, I am very satisfied with the overfilling brunch I ordered.

He was intrigued so we made a quick detour for brunch.Walked around the photogenic town a bit and finally made our way to Paul's Pancake House.

I've never had waffles that perfectly cooked. The outside was so crunchy and filled with layers while the middle was soft, gooey, and oh-so moist. It was heavenly. I'm now spoiled and will never enjoy another waffle the same way again until I come back.The Danish pancakes were pretty darn amazing, too! Two extremely large (maybe 12""-14"" diameter) flat panckes with simple powdered sugar, butter, and buttery maple syrup? Excuisite. Just exquisite.

I drive all the way from San Francisco to try these delicious pancakes and was rudely rejected! Paula's Pancake House is the only restaurant in Solvang that has outside seating but is NOT pet friendly! If you are driving by Solvang, I suggest you do stop by!

Just remember, if you are traveling with your pet (a member of your family) do not even attempt to go to Paula's Pancake House as the hostess with rudely tell you that pets are not allowed in the outside seating. Also, from what I saw, the food didn't look that great and I didn't smell any pancakes being made!

The salad my wife ordered equally as unimpressive. But yes I KNOW this is a breakfast place, well I'm not really a breakfast at 1pm guy. So keep that in mind please lunch was just OK.However we stopped here the next day for breakfast because hell all these yelpers can't be wrong right? I ordered the Danish Pancakes with Strawberry and the wife got a cheese omlette. The pancakes were good, but the homemade whipped cream was excellent, strawberries were fresh and the trio didn't need much in the way of syrup to make it taste good. The omlette was good and breakfast ended up costing just under $20 for the two of us so I'd definately check it out if you're in town.There is ALWAYS a line so keep that in mind, parties of 2 get sat faster, and there is also bar seating.

8/15/2010,"Seal Beach, CA","I had not been to Solvang since I was a child so we decided to make it a stop on our road trip to Northern Ca.  This is one of the first eateries you see as you drive into town.  We ordered a decent no frills breakfast. Service was quick and friendly.  Waitresses wear Disneyland type Danish dresses.  Which is kinda why I was drawn to eat here.  I am a sucker to see how well a place can pull off a good ""theme"".  Speaker music was a mix generic hits from multiple decades, didn't really fit the feel of the outside patio or the town of Solvang.  I really wish that ""Themed"" places would make custom playlists with themed music to match.I ordered regular French Toast which was good because it was not overly sweet.  I see all the comments on weather or not the OJ is fresh squeezed.  Our OJs came out at room temp and tart which is an indicator that it had been fresh squeezed that day.  The OJ was good. It was overall good experience but I would still probably try someplace different next time to get an overall feel for the eateries in town.  I would still recommend this place as a good place to stop for breakfast.  And yes, if it says ""Pancake House"", I would only ever order breakfast.",4 star rating,Natalie J.
11/2/2010,"San Gabriel, CA","Swung by Paula's Pancake House on recommendation from Mimi C. and was not disappointed.  Well, with the pancakes at least.Considering the name of the place, I naturally went for the Paula's special: Danish pancakes topped with cinnamon apples (or strawberries / blueberries) and whipped cream.  Simply put: it was excellent.  The pancakes with cinnamon apples were already good enough, and the whipped cream extends that into awesome territory.  There was some syrup on the side too, but I found that to be way too sweet to use compared with the cinnamon apples + whipped cream combo.Oh yeah, and definitely get that whipped cream on the side.  I did, and the cup had a mound of cream which was easily good enough for double the number of pancakes I had.My friend, who isn't much of a pancake person, ended up getting a Danish sausage + (Havarti) cheese omelet.  The sausage itself didn't have too much flavor, and Havarti is pretty mild to begin with too, so the omelet experience was much more pedestrian compared with the pancakes.Overall: Come for the pancakes, pass on the omelets.",4 star rating,Sherman W.

This is an awesome brunch place that is hidden in the little Danish town of Solvang.I came with the girlfriend's family and we ordered some Danish pancakes that came with sausage patties and eggs (scrambled and sunny-side up). These pancakes were hands-down the best pancakes ever!! The pancakes, topped with powdered sugar, orange marmalade, and maple syrup, was a delight to my taste buds!!We also ordered the eggs benedict, and it was fresh and delicious.Even the orange juice here was freshly squeezed and tasted superb!!If you are ever in this area, please do check this place out.

4/29/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","As a current resident of Solvang, it is true that I will avoid Paula's on the weekend strictly due to the wait. However, when visitors come to town, it is almost always required that we make a stop. I'm not big on sweet breakfasts personally, but the Danish pancakes (what they are famous for) are always deli-sh according to pals...I do sneak bites from time to time and they are! Omelettes are always good, eggs benedict is a personal fave, and I must say, lunch never disappoints. These are basic diner choices, but after a long night of partying with friends, sometimes a yummy burger, or grilled sandwich, with fries is the best cure...that and mimosas, for sure! Get the carafe with fresh squeezed OJ and you're set to go. Service varies from waitress to waitress, but normally they don't disappoint. I definitely recommend sitting outside, but sometimes that can be an even longer wait. I'd expect to wait at LEAST 20 minutes on the weekends, unless you get there after 1pm. All in all, this Danish restaurant should not disappoint!",4 star rating,Michelle P.

Today we decided to put our name on the list and then take a walk. We were told that it would be 40 minutes but we waited over an hour. It's the same breakfast and sandwiches that you can get at any number of Danish style restaurants in Solvang. The hash browns were nice and crispy but nothing was interesting or exceptional. I won't eat here again. Not at all worth the long wait. And what's up with all the flies?,2 star rating,Alaina K.

Pancakes and waffles, eggs/omelettes, sandwiches etc.I had the rib-eye and my wife had the Italian omelette. My son had mini chocolate-chip pancakes. The meals were pretty good fare.And of course, we tried the famous danish pancakes. Thinner than normal pancakes. Served 2 on a plate. Different batter than buttermilk.

Around 1:00pm a gentleman came by looking for his wife and daughter. I will explain later. At 1:10pm the waitress said the cook got our order wrong due to the waffle order. She apologized. At 1:15pm we left due to no food. This was on a  Friday(7-17-2015) and the place was not crowded. Regarding the gentleman who came looking for his wife and daughter he found them at the restaurant across the street. They had similarly left due to lack of service.

I knew that we had to get up early and take the morning walk over before 9am before we get caught up in the waiting for a table game.Arrived at 830am (Friday) morning on foot from our hotel and were seated immediately. We both ordered coffee, Danish pancakes combo which comes with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and sausage (had the Danish sausage). The hubs being one of the pickiest eaters ever was seriously moaning after his first bite. I wasn't sure if it was because he was starving, since only having a salad the night before. And I'm glad to report that moan was from having the pancakes. I have to second that. These pancakes were a cross between a regular pancake and a crepe, thin and spongey. The powdered sugar, light in taste syrup and butter was just the right amount to enhance the pancakes even more. I'm sure the fruited ones are really good too, but I thought I would try them in it's true and original form. Let's not forget the Danish sausage. I love the sausage-it's like a hot dog meets a knockwurst without the bits and pieces of cartilage in the sausage.Breakfast is served all day and that means only until 3pm because that is when they close.I definitely will be back for this meal again and will recommend to those visiting the area.",5 star rating,Jowel G.

Paula's really did renew my interest and craving for pancakes.  And I'm not really a pancake kind of guy either.  These pancakes are pretty thin and don't have that doughy aftertaste that you have in some pancakes that just use a lot of batter, but don't concentrate on the flavor and whatever spices they put inside.  Coupled with homemade whip cream and your choice of fruit (I picked strawberries), the couple of large pancakes I received in the Paula's Special for about $9 was an absolute joy.  I didn't really find the Santa Maria chili beans or veggie side dishes anything special so I'd stay away from those, but you can't go wrong with a mimosa (which is pretty hard to mess up).  The only problem is that I only had one glass of mimosa and I was kind of ""gone"".....",5 star rating,Albie F.

Plus when you're in Solvang, you want to take ever opportunity to soak up the Danish culture.I came for breakfast, of course to get some Danish Style pancakes with fresh fruit. I got Paula' Special and a side of the highly recommended Solvang Danish-Style Sausage, Medisterpolse. Here are my thoughts.Paula's Special - very well prepared Danish pancakes. I would recommend it.Medisterpolse (Solvang Danish-Style Sausage) - WOW! Wonderful! After one bite, I knew I wanted to buy a few packs to take home. This white sausage is nice and mild, yet amazingly flavorful. You can literally eat it alone. Excellent slightly browned, because it adds a nice toasted aroma that adds the already marvelous taste. This place is a solid breakfast place, but where it shines is the Medisterpolse. I would make a trip here just for that. I ended up taking 4 lbs of Medisterpolse with me after I finished eating. Come here for breakfast and leave with a bunch of Medisterpolse. Enjoy!",3 star rating,Michael W.

Usually a good sign.Long story short, their Danish pancakes are DELICIOUS. Really thin pancakes topped with powdered sugar and syrup that's not overly sweet. I don't remember anything else from that place except those pancakes. We (4 guys) ended up driving 3 hours to that cute little Danish town again just to eat there. 'Nuff said.*Edit*I ate here and at Ellen's during my last visit to Solvang just to compare the two, and I have to say Paula's still has my loyalty when it comes to Danish pancakes.

6/4/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","I've been here a couple times during my stay in Solvang over the last summer and I was introduced to the Danish pancake.I already am a fan of the average pancake, not to mention crepes. I immediately fell in love. The two times I ate here, I ordered the same dish, the Danish Pancakes. I was just so satisfied the first time that I had to have it again before I left back for LA. Accompanying this meal was a finely squeezed cup of fresh orange juice. I always enjoy fresh squeezed OJ, so I was happy.I don't remember much else about Paula's unfortunately. It's a fine diner-like pancake house with kind service. I almost rated them a 4 but am really rating this a 3.5, sadly it'll appear as a 3. I'm basing this mainly off of the Danish pancakes but in a town like Solvang and it being my first time, I'd really have to have something to compare them to before I rate any higher. Every other review says they're amazing, which I won't deny but I don't want to jump to any conclusions by comparing them to standard pancakes or crepes. It wouldn't do anyone justice.Maybe I'll try my hand at some Danish pancakes in LA and come back to follow up.",3 star rating,Deepee N.
8/5/2010,"San Mateo, CA","This was breakfast #2 for us, so maybe this review is based on the fact that I wasn't truly hungry?Husby and I both ordered the combo with Danish pancakes, Danish sausage, and scrambled eggs.  The portions were very generous- the two very thin pancakes covered 90% of the platter.  The Danish sausage was pretty thick.  The eggs came on a separate little dish.To me, the pancakes didn't taste all that special.  It was like thin Bisquik pancakes.  I guess if you like Bisquick then it's not a bad thing- just not a superb thing either.My suspicion is that since it's one of the first restaurants you see as you come up from 246 into Solvang, that a lot of people have reviewed this restaurant.  Next time I'll venture in a little more and maybe walk around to read menus, scope out what's on peoples' plates (if they've got sidewalk seating), and then choose a place.Decent and good value if you want to try something Solvang-y.",3 star rating,jen a.

Oh boy!  Those are my two favorite breakfast items so I had to try them both here.  The eggs benedict had a great hollandaise sauce and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  The english muffin was toasted just right also (some places toast it too much and it's too crispy).  The pancakes were amazing!  I had the regular pancakes instead of Danish pancakes, because I just had a feeling that they would be good here.  And I was so right!  They were delicious and fluffy, with lots of bananas inside and some on top.  Not only did they have good food, but great friendly service.",5 star rating,Cookie N.

Except  Epcot is in Florida on the other side of the country, and in Solvang the crowds are decidedly older. You would have to be an evil parent to drag your kid here as there are no rides, no mazes, and no cartoon characters. This isnt a review of Solvang though, nor an explanation on how or why I ended up here. This is a review on the Pancake House. And as a place to get pancakes its pretty damn good. The Danish pancakes anyway, not sure about ordering anything else. Everybody at the table had the signature dish and devoured the cakes. They were light, thin and buttery. I had the signature sausage to go with it, and that wasnt very good. In fact it was awful, but you can order regular breakfast sausage which is much better. The eggs were cold, and the coffee isnt great, and if you get here after 930 on a weekend your going to be in for a hell of a wait.  So basically if you find yourself in this cartoon town for some reason, you know where to get a solid breakfast.",3 star rating,Matt M.

We got ours topped with strawberry and whipped cream with syrup on the side. It was delicious! The whipped cream was bleh though, and tasted kind of... fatty? Ended up not eating that, but the syrup was wonderful and not your typical kind either... it was also very light in taste and not as thick as regular syrup - it went very well with the pancakes. I wished they had added more powdered sugar to our pancakes! Only 3 stars because even though the pancakes tasted great, it was only two very thin pancakes for about $9 - not exactly a great value. I came around 2pm, so almost no wait, but I'm not sure if I'd brave the massive crowds in the morning. Also, I left afterwards feeling extremely sugared-up... which led to the inevitable crash afterwards (with help from all the other sweets found in various Solvang bakeries).

I had the dutch pancake with a side of blueberry topping, eggs, their german sausage, and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. The pancakes were very large but thin, and they reminded me of crepes. But they're super delicious, and the blueberry topping was actually blueberries made into topping, not that fake stuff. They tasted sweet and fresh, and I thought I was in heaven. The german sausage was also good, and had just a tinge of spices. They have this huge orange juice squeezer where they just throw oranges in and out comes juice. It looked like something out of Wonka's factory, and it produced awesome juice.

7/20/2016,"Studio City, CA","Been meaning to write this review for a few weeks now.. Came here a few times when visiting Solvang.. Place is always packed. The last time we visited, which was about 2 weekends ago, we had guests from out of town and wanted to show them around California, so we decided Solvang and then Santa Barbara would be nice. We thought Paula's Pancake House would be a great place to take them. Boy did we regret it! We made our way through the crowd, up to the hostess stand where we gave our party name to this very RUDE man with a disgusting attitude. He put our name down on the list and said it would be an hour wait. We asked if we could walk around and have them give us a call when the table was ready, the man, who by the way seemed like he was the manager or owner, snapped at us and said that they don't take numbers and to walk back in 45 minutes. He had so much attitude, we didn't even want to come back. After about 45 minutes of walking around, we decided to walk back and thought maybe that man was having a tough day. We walked back and waited another 35 minutes to get seated. Finally sat down and ordered our coffees. When the waitress came back to take our orders, that same man with that nasty attitude walked out of the back room and started scolding our waitress as she was taking our order. It was such a rude episode, we all felt so bad for her. At this point I just wanted to get up and leave. Mind you, the food tasted horrible! And I think the fact that we were so over the place didn't help. Worst experience. Never coming back.",1 star rating,J R.

It's O.K.Got green tea (bigelow for $2.25... blech), extra crispy hash browns, Danish sausage, two eggs over medium and a biscuit for a little under $9. One of my friends got the same (with scrambled eggs), another got the waffle with fresh strawberries and whipped cream, and another got the Danish pancake, Danish sausage, and 2 eggs over medium. My hash browns were probably the best part of my meal, but required salt and pepper. The Sausage was good and tasted a little like Pork Shumai to me (which is a good thing). The casing is a little tough to cut through with the butter knife, but we all managed ok. The eggs were cooked perfectly but kind of greasy (which is typical for a breakfast place I suppose). The biscuit wasn't great.The women's bathroom has a see-through curtain and a window that opens out into the alleyway, which made for a rush job.I called 1.5 hrs ahead and so when we got there we were seated within 10 minutes.

Since then, I have been dragging friends out of their homes at 4 in the morning so we can be the first ones there when it opens at 6am (It's that effin' wonderful!)Aaaannd, if you are coming from the L.A. area, like me, you have the Camarillo Outlets on the way. Soooo, when people ask: ""You went all that way for some pancakes!?"" you can reply, ""Uh, no! I also went for some awesome bargain shopping!"", although deep down you know you just went for the pancakes! Tee-hee...;D",5 star rating,Suchin H.
3/18/2013,"Ventura, CA","I feel like a schlub writing this review, after seeing all the 4+ star ratings others have given.  Maybe I was there at the wrong time/day.Staff was very friendly, and food came up very fast (I was really surprised--it was like the restaurant scene in the movie 'Defending Your Life'), but the danish pancakes were not hot by a long shot....maybe they were pre-made and that's why it was ready so fast.??They tasted fine, even at room temp, but the 'whipped butter' was more like 'whipped margarine'.  The 'butter' was soft/room temperature, but it was yellow-yellow like margarine, and it suspiciously didn't melt even when I poured the only warm item on the plate (the syrup), and it didn't impart any flavor the way real butter does.  Sigh.The coffee was OK...not bad, not amazing.So,although not terrible, $9.99 for a mediocre meal of a single plate of 2 danish pancakes and cup of coffee, and I was wishing I had stopped at Taco Bell instead.  I did  tip the waitress $3.00 on the $10 ticket--she was fine...just the food was mediocre.",2 star rating,Deborah H.

My poor bf had allergies and I made him suck it up until after breakfast to buy him benadryl. Got the combo Danish pancake plate. Serving size was huge for their price. Worth the wait. Unfortunately I don't think my bf liked it so much through all his sneezes and could not smell LOL. It's small and crowded inside with a cozy home cabin feel. Cute.,5 star rating,Mags T.

4/17/2012,"Schoolcraft, MI","We ate at Paula's Pancake House and it was TO. DIE. FOR. There was a long line waiting outside but the host kept it moving and we only had to wait about twenty minutes.  There is plenty to walk around and see while waiting, so it wasn't a problem. I wanted to try something authentic, so even though I hate sausage I ordered the Danish Omelette which had sausage inside and was topped with havarti cheese.  I got some fresh salsa on the side and hashbrowns as well.  The omelette was amazing, and if all sausage tasted this good I might be a fan! My husband ordered the Paula's Special which are Danish pancakes.  The pancakes were super thin and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  A heaping pile of fresh strawberries and whipped cream came with this dish, and it was also out of this world.  The maple syrup was fresh and homemade.  It was so thin, it was watery--not thick like traditional syrups-- but the flavor was perfect! We give Paula's a 10/10 and would recommend stopping here for some authentic danish fare!Pics and full review:  comeoneileen86.blogspot.…",5 star rating,Ashley S.

I wonder if Fedor ever visited this place?The danish sausages were yummy packed with flavor I tell u Homie G.Their orange juice are freshly squeezed and was sweet and tangy. I usually don't eat much for my first meal so I ended up having left overs. I know kinda pathetic since I'm a guy.

Top the pancakes with fresh strawberries and creme and you have heaven. Just thinking about them and I start to salivate.Since I knew the pancakes could not make me full, I also ordered a tri-club sandwich. Not the best sandwich ever, but it was very good nonetheless. It had fresh meats along with delicious toasty bread. The fries were some of the better ones that I've had.Go here for their Danish pancakes! You will not be disappointed.",5 star rating,Shun F.

It is pretty popular in Solvang. the 45 minute wait gave us a chance to browse the nearby gift shops and bakeries. they have a beautiful shaded patio for those who want to eat outside.Like it's name says, they are known for their Swedish Pancakes. They are thin and light, and perfectly tender. They are best with a little powder sugar and butter, but you can try them with the chunky peach or strawberry preserve. The chicken fried steak was delicious and comforting. The orange juice is as FRESH as can be, but a little pricey for the small cup.",4 star rating,Alvin Y.
12/5/2012,"Antelope, CA","My brother and I stopped in for breakfast at Paula's Pancake House on a Tuesday Morning.  We were on kind of a working vacation so we were relaxed but not really in the tourist mindset.  When we walked in I noticed there were maybe three other tables with customers but it was pretty slow. The young girl at the counter showed us to our table but she was not overly friendly.  She did not make any conversation nor did she ask the usual questions... ""Is this OK"", ""Would you like water or coffee?""  Not a big deal... maybe it was her first day. As we sat and waited, I noticed there were about six girls of the same age group (17-24) in outfits behind the counter and the service area. They were all busily talking amongst themselves not paying attention to anyone.  I could hear portions of their conversations, which covered everything from boys to bras.  Our waitress arrived at the table and took our order. She was older than the girls and was pleasant enough but still not friendly.  She brought our food and did a coffee refill. Towards the end of the meal, my brother and I needed another refill. I looked around a noticed that all of the girls were still rooted to their same stops talking and laughing and our waitress has joined them.  Despite several attempts, we could not catch anyone's eye for service.  The food was good... the coffee was standard... the service was lacking. I would eat here again, but I certainly wouldn't stand in line to come back. Apparently, Paula's Pancake House is doing so well, they can afford to pay employees to stand around and chat... good for them.  Not so good for the customer.",2 star rating,Dave M.

The reason for 1 star is we were so disgusted by the all the flies we could not enjoy even the average food. There were flies everywhere! On our hands, our clothes, food, other people as they waited, the chairs, everywhere! A fly landed in our butter twice and it couldn't get out. We had to sit there and watch it struggle for life. I had to scoop it out so we didn't have to watch it anymore then here comes another one, right in the butter!  We lost our appetitie as there were so many! Don't these people know that installing a fan right over the door can minimize the flies in their restaurant! I will never go back to this place!

2/25/2010,"Spring, TX","First off, Breakfast can be eaten any time of the day, and breakfast here is a must at least once if not twice, etc, etc...It has become a ritual to go here since I first took a trip up to Solvang with my college buddies. So when ever someone attends Paula's without the original group, its a must to capture a picture of their incredible pancakes and mass text it. I always order the Danish Pancake Combo. The Pancakes are by far the best I have had, they are thin and airy, don't underestimate them though, these are large pancakes. These have a crepe like texture, lightly dusted with powdered sugar, that melts when you add just a bit of syrup to it. The Danish sausage that accompanies the pancakes, has its own flavorful taste, and I have to say compliments the pancakes, like laces to shoes. The pancakes deliver just enough sweet while the sausage gives you the opposite mixture of meat and spices. OH, and their fresh squeezed orange juice, yum!The atmosphere makes this food taste even better, yea I'm sure your wondering, OK how does scenery add to the food. It does! Trust me, or not? There is a very home-like feeling to Paula's. They have indoor and outdoor seating, get outdoor if you can and you're there on a beautiful day. The touristy building designs are a treat to see while eating a delicious breakfast.",5 star rating,Jamie M.

The eggs were a bit over done for scrambled, but hot sauce can help with just about anything.

Like I said, I'm not a big fan of pancakes but these were awesome! They were thin, like a thick crepe, and full of subtle spices. You really didn't need syrup or topping on them. The Dutch sausage was a little weird to me. Texture of Irish/English stuff-I'd-rather-know-know-is-in-my-sausage sausage and the flavor of veal (which I don't like).

3/15/2009,"San Francisco, CA","Dilema ...corned beef hash or chicken fried steak?  They both sound delicious don't they.  I'm soooo happy i went with the hash.  It was salty goodness and then some, cuz it came with perfectly toasted sourdough and fluffy scrambled eggs.  The entire dished was consumed, it was one of those meals =)The bf had the danish pancake with blueberrys.  For a thin pancake it sure was fluffy.  The texture was a little chewy instead of just airy like buttermilk pancakes so it really added to the experience.  Oh and it was HUGE, the pancake even folded over was the size of the plate, just enough to share.  The blueberrys were fresh, you can tell they also whip their own cream cuz it was dense and not overly sweet like the kind u get from a spray can.  I know i won't be back to solvang anytime soon, but for sure, I will be at Paula's when I do return.",4 star rating,Ames K.
1/1/2010,"Orange County, CA","My boyfriend and I found this place on yelp so we decided to stop by and try it out.  I ordered the danish pancakes combo and my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs.  Both dishes were enjoyable and were very delicious.The major complaint I have for this place is that the service as BAD.  We were informed that our waitress had been working there for only 2 days so we were really nice to her.  When she took our order, she informed us that both combos came with toast or an english muffin.  But when we got our orders and asked about it, the other waitress said only the steak and eggs had the toast/muffin.Then, I asked our waitress if my pancake combo came with strawberries topping, in which she said no.  I ordered a side of it, which she COMPLETELY FORGOT about until we had to remind her again.  After she brought out a side of strawberries, another waitress brought out another side of strawberries mistakenly thinking we did not get the first one.Overall, the food here was good, but the service was horrible.  Everything I ordered besides the pancakes, I had to repeated ask for again.",3 star rating,Dena N.
1/3/2010,"Orange County, CA","FOOD: The Danish Pancakes are excellent. Danish Sausage is ok, but overpriced though.AMBIANCE: Crowded. We were a party of five and crammed into the corner on the left side of the restaurant, uncomfortable, tight seating, servers and customers constantly bumping against our seats...WAIT TIME: Expect to wait a lot during peak hours.SERVICE: I almost left no tip. While it is understandable to wait a long time to be seated at a popular restaurant, it is very disappointing when most of your experience during the meal entails having to wait even more for.... the WAITER. The gentleman behind me literally got up, walked over to the coffee pots and poured his own coffee. Our waitress disappeared for over 20 minutes, and no ones in the staff seemed to care... we are supposed to add 15% to our bill for this?RATING NOTE: Our experience at Paula's Pancakes was a little disappointing due to the combination of wait time for seating, uncomfortable and tight seating, and poor service from overly busy or just plain inattentive staff.The second star on this review is solely for the excellent Danish Pancakes. Despite this, we would go back there if is not so busy and we could select a better table.

I'm not a big OJ person, but damn this was so yum! The perfect amount of pulp and sweetness. However, be warned when you order a small it really is tiny- maybe 8 oz? I don't know but I found myself rationing this approx $3 fresh OJ to last me the course of my meal. So my gripe about this place...the fact that they don't allow for substitutions of their meat items. We simply asked for hash browns and to hold the meat item and our waitress said that they don't substitute. WHAT? It's not like I'm asking for something extra. If you do have plans on coming here come before 8am, (we missed it by 10 min) to save some $$ on breakfast specials.",3 star rating,Ami S.

BOO. This was about a year and a half ago during our trip up the coast, but I can't imagine it has changed much.  It was cute from the outside, but crowded inside.

Dude, it was the best thing ever!  So let me break it down for you...First of all I'm not sure what is in a ""Danish"" style pancake, but crack must be one of the ingredients.  The batter was not loaded with sugar, they were thin, butter-like with a nice crispiness around the edges.  I loved that the batter was not super sweet becuase the fresh whipped cream and the nice scoop of butter complemented it very well.  Part of the description on the menu says they are ""large pancakes"".  They aren't kidding.  I had ONE pancake at it was folded over and barely fit on my plate.Now get this.. we came here for lunch, but because I love breakfast and sweets I couldn't pass the pancakes.  My recommendation to you is no matter what time of day you show up to this place, get the PANCAKES!

I pretty much ordered what was recommended by everyone.  Get the Danish Pancake.  I'm sure it would've tasted better if I asked for fresh fruit topping, but I forgot.  After the 45 minutes of waiting, I just wanted to eat!  It was different.  It was like a mix of a French Crepe and a buttermilk pancake.  It was good.I mean, it's not something I would crave and drive 4 hours north to eat, but I'm glad I tried it.  It wasn't a bad experience.  Food was good, service was friendly.  Expect to wait.  Then again, it was Memorial Day and EVERYONE seem to be in Solvang that day.",4 star rating,Arlene M.
8/5/2012,"Torrance, CA","After our wine tour and tasting, my bf and I decided to drive to downtown Solvang to grab a bite to eat. Not knowing the area, I looked on yelp to find a nearby restaurant since we were famished. I searched for pancakes and found this. We fried the danish pancakes and eggs benedict. We really enjoyed the danish pancakes since we both never had them before. The eggs benedict, on the other hand, was nothing special. What made my dining experience horrible was the fly that landed on one of the eggs. I was so disgusted I didn't want to eat anymore. We sat next to the main entrance, which they left open, so no wonder there were flies entering and exiting the restaurant. So disgusting! The host and waitresses were nice but nothing extraordinary. Their work attire was cute though - something like a swedish milk maid halloween costume. The restaurant seemed small, although they have an outdoor section. I felt like we might as well as should have eaten outside because flies are expected there. Maybe the main entrance door should remain shut to resolve that issue but if not I wouldn't expect customers coming here a second time.

Service was attentive and the place was cozy and clean.  Prices were very reasonable and again the food was great.  I have to say that Danish pancakes are my kind of pancakes.  Light, fluffy, bouncy, flavorful, THE BEST!  Wish there was some place in LA that served them.  They'd be a hot sell.",5 star rating,Maximus I.

Seems like the giggling girls have better or worse service directly proportionate to the number of customers they have.. more customers=better service... ?? Perhaps it is that I always come in alone, sit at the counter and they think I have friends coming.. Weird. This is the third time now. I really want to give this place a good review because it is a Solvang icon that many people seem to enjoy. Their pancakes are amazing and when all the wrong orders come to the table hot and quickly (after they finally get my order in) looking very delicious-breakfast-y I make a decision to return based solely on their scrumptious  fare... right or wrong order.Good luck here, you might do better than me.  If you are after a decent brekky you can get it either here or at Ellen's.",3 star rating,Pepper P.

Typically, i'm not a breakfast person because it seems too greasy, carb-y, sugary and heavy for me to carry out my day. I almost always feel sluggish and want my afternoon siesta. But Paula's was just that good to not pass up when in Solvang. In our search of authentic swedish food in this quaint town, this is the place to go for danish pancakes, as well as the eggs benedict and freshly squeezed oj.

8/22/2012,"Contra Costa County, CA","Not sure what all the fuss is about. Their pancakes are large and somewhat thin, but not particularly flavorful and definitely not crisp -- mine were totally limp. The syrup has a nice orange flavor to it, but that's not enough to salvage those pancakes. I make better at home.Also, the customer service left a lot to be desired. It took a really long time just to get water and have my order taken. I wanted eggs and pancakes, so I got the combo. It's supposed to come with meat, which I don't eat. I asked for something else instead and was told ""no substitutions.""I'm sure lots of people will continue to come here because it's in a central location and fairly affordable.

Their staff is dressed in cute traditional Danish clothing and they were all young girls. Our waitress was great. Because we have a one-year-old, we basically have to switch off entertaining him (walking him around, etc.) while the other eats.     I thought the wait for food would take forever because of the reviews I read and the fact that the place was filling up immediately (on a Monday morning no less), so I took my little guy for a walk. To my surprise, our food arrived within 10 minutes and my hubby called to tell me to return. It took us about 5min. to get back, and the waitress had put my food back under the warmer in the kitchen. I was really surprised and appreciated this so much!      I got the veggie omelette and it was possibly the best omelette I've had. My hubby got the Danish pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream and it was sooo delicious. Awas even better was the cheap bill for such great food!

One side of the restaurant has a big window, so you can sit and watch people on the street of Solvang, which is a lovely small town with unusual architecture.

Five seconds later, out of nowhere, they plopped their horrible food on our table. The eggs Benedict was lukewarm (not hot), the hollandaise sauce was bland, the single slice of ham on the Benedict was thin enough to pass for lunchmeat, and the yolk was undercooked (eggs Benedict is supposed to have a slightly gelatinous yolk).

I had the something-special which was 2 Danish pancakes (almost plate-sized thin pancakes) with powdered sugar, ball of butter and syrup (don't think twas pure Maple), 2 big & crispy bacon and 2 eggs. The pancakes were really good, not just the right softness and dough-ness. My husband had the other something-special which was a Belgian waffle with ball of butter and syrup and a Danish sausage which is looked almost like an Italian sausage except it's pale in color and tasted more like a pate' sausage, not like your ordinary breakfast sausage. He didn't care for it but it wasn't bad. It's a better-with-mustard-type of a sausage.

10/22/2012,"Redondo Beach, CA","I hate to rate this place two stars because the food is great but the service is no where near it. If you are going there with more than a party of two, look elsewhere. My girlfriend and I usually go with another couple and now on a couple occasions, a party of 10+. The first time we went with a party of 12 we were not surprised that the wait would be outrageous. However, I will say that being told on multiple occasions that it is only 10-15 more minutes is very annoying and put us in a very bad mood before we started eating. The second time we planned on going, with 10 people, I decided to call ahead to see if I can add our name to the list, this was something the hostess recommended we do when we were planning our trip two weeks in advance. The lady on the phone said no problem, she asked me what time I planned on being there and I told her 9:15am. Again, she said no problem. We get there at about 8:15am and I am told that it will be 10-15 minutes. At this point that is not a problem so I go and wait in line for the restroom which took quite some time since there was a line. I come out of the restroom, chat with my group and then ask for an update and the answer is.............10-15 minutes. Considering I was just away for 10-15 minutes, I am surprised that this is the response I was given. I stress my dismay to the gentlemen who seems to be the owner of the restaurant and he is not sympathetic whatsoever. He tells me that the person on the phone should have stressed that it is not a reservation and is subject to whatever time I get there. He then turned around and told the lady that he needs help managing the line and for her to alert him when a table for 2, 4 5 and then 10 becomes available. Since we had a reservation for a van to pick us up at a specific time which was inching closer and closer, we decided to leave and eat next door. Although the food next door was not pancakes nor was it a hearty meal, it still satisfied us quickly and got us on the way. I am extremely displeased with the amount of time wasted and the fact the owner, or son of the owner, was so rude. I would expect much more in regards to customer service but apparently when you have a restaurant which has extremely long lines you no longer are required to be courteous. Absolutely ridiculous. Again, if you are going with a party which consists of more than 2 people, go elsewhere. Calling in advance will not gain you anything whatsoever.",2 star rating,Philip C.

BUT I have one huge complaint and that is the tiny flies that were constantly flying about and lounging on our arms, hair, table, etc. We had to keep swatting to keep them at bay and away from our food. I know it was hot and they kept the door open with the flow of customers, BUT really couldn't they install a lamp to keep the flies away? They were disgusting.

For starters, we decided to share a plate of their Paula's Special Danish Pancakes (sweet crepe-like pancakes with FRESH sweet strawberries and whipped cream), as well as one of the Danish sausages. The kiddies wanted the chocolate chip pancakes with fresh fruit; hubby and I opted for Eggs Florentine and Eggs Hemingway (with smoked salmon), also served with choice of fruit or hash browns. Kiddies ordered a side of bacon for good measure. Wow, wow, wow, and wow. The Danish Pancakes were simply amazing. Don't even bother messing them up with syrup: they are made sweet, and you won't need it. The Danish sausage was--sausage, and the kids gobbled it like it was going out of style. They are big-time meat eaters. The Eggs Hemingway was AMAZING! Perfectly poached eggs, nicely toasted English muffin, no chintzing on the smoked salmon, and delicious Hollandaise sauce. Hubby gobbled down the Florentine. Plenty of melty chocolate chips on the kiddie's pancakes to spread around. This is a destination breakfast, more than worth the 30-minute wait.

6/18/2009,"Long Beach, CA","Forblffende PandekagerThat odd language above is Danish. In English it means amazing pancakes. Well at Paula's Pancake House in Solvang they serve the most forblffende Danish pandekager I have ever had.Solvang has many choices for breakfast but I think Paula's is by far the best. I have been to Paula's on many occasions and I have yet to have a bad meal. The first time I tried their Danish pancakes I was immediately hooked. Actually there more like crepes then pancakes because of how thin and light they are. The Danish pancakes with powdered sugar topped with fresh strawberries and house made whipped cream are delicious. I have tried other Danish pancakes before but Paula's are my favorite. I always get a side of Danish sausage to go along with my pancakes. Danish sausage is one of the best tasting sausages I have had. My grandpa is a huge fan of their eggs benedict. To go along with your meal I highly recommend you order a glass of their fresh squeezed orange juice. Service here on the weekends can be a little slow so be prepared for a little wait. I have read other reviews claiming that the waiters/waitresses at Paula's were rude but I have always had really friendly servers. The prices here are just like an IHOP or Denny's.

7/28/2013,"Carson, CA","I hardly ever write reviews. Here is the short side. GOOD LUCK!!! trying to eat here.  You first have to get past DAN (the 6 foot man with the writing pad) until then you can look at the food, but you can't eat it. We couldn't.  Want to know more???? Read on.On July 27th (Saturday) We went with great anticipation to this place. Please understand we like to keep things simple and we prefer humility to pride or loud behavior.     So...what can we say about this place?     The food looked good and it's hard to say much about the staff (when looking from afar). The 3 of us were looking forward to great pancakes at this place (since the night before, when we arrived and walked past the closed restaurant), BUT we never had a chance.    Dan (with the yellow writing pad) who assigns the guest to their seats, took my name and gave an ETA of 45 min. 1 1/2 hour later...NOTHING. When my name went on the list there were no other names below me half hour later there were names and another party of 3. one hour later 3 party's of 3(often he would drop the pad by his side and I would look to see who was crossed out. They were all seated and we were not.     The final insult came when 3 other people came and they were greeted as friends. He said ""let's go inside and see if I can find a seat for you. He saw me looking at him and knew I could hear him. A Short while later he came out and told them to go around to the back.  I am absolutely certain they were seated.  Others stood up and left (I'm sure we were not the only ones treated this way. Why? I don't know.  Clearly they have a bias.   I told my wife we have to go and told her why. She could not believe it.  She wanted to see the list and at first he would not show it, but others were watching and he had felt pressured (which did nothing to humble him or show regret). She saw all the names crossed out including other party of 3's after us and she got mad. I told her to forget it, it's not worth it.   My  6 year old daughter was sad and hungry and asked why he seated everyone else and not us. I didn't know what to say.  It's been a long time since I experienced this kind of behavior and if I can help it...It will be our last. Word of warning... I found out Dan is the owner of the establishment and he has no email (based on a recent call to the restaurant- I guess he does not care what people think).   If you think you can charm your way past this guy, give them a try. Maybe their food will be worth it.   Otherwise... go to the bakery next door (I did).  The staff was wonderful, the buttery pastry's melt in your mouth and their is a family like atmosphere.

1/6/2009,"San Francisco, CA","This cute little pancake house located on the main drag of Solvang serves just about the best damn Danish pancake west of Copenhagen.  If you are up in the Santa Ynez Valley on a Sideways weekend, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not trying this place at least once.You'll be able to spot this place easily by the horde of people waiting outside during the late morning and early lunch hour--if you wanna try to beat the crowd, either get there really early (8 am) or late (after 1).  Fortunately we only had to wait about 20 minutes or so the last time we went.  We ordered the Danish pancake topped with blueberries and a California omelette.  The texture of the pancake is divine, kinda crispy on the outside and moist on the inside--kinda similar to a French crepe but a bit thicker.  It's covered in powdered sugar (yum) and comes with a side of butter and syrup.  Unfortunately, the blueberries were the canned syrup kind and not fresh blueberries as I hoped--I left most of them untouched.  Surprisingly, their omelettes were quite delectable as well.  The California omelette comes with chili pepper, topped with grated cheddar cheese and sliced avocado--and a side of salsa as well.  The omelette was soft and fluffy.  We also got a side of hash browns with that---and those were good too!  Their OJ is freshly squeezed as well.  Their portions are moderate--not too big and not too small, enough to satisfy not stuff, and their prices are fair, considering it's located in a tourist trap.My only gripe about this place is that it's freakin 3 hours away from where I live--Original Pancake House can't hold a candle to Paula's Pancake House.",5 star rating,Jen O.

Dusty ambience is never a good thing.  The most disappointing aspect of the visit was that the host lied to us saying that our dog was not allowed on the patio, and not 20 minutes later he's escorting an elderly couple with their ugly mutt out on the patio.  He even pet the dog.  This host told my wife it was against County regulations to allow dogs at a restaurant.  This restaurant isn't worth the imitation dutchgirl outfits it makes its Latino waitresses wear.  Try the bakery next door if you get a chance.",1 star rating,Kent M.

They then forgot about us - once we noticed other people who came after us being seated (we were only a group of 4) we inquired and were told we would be seated next. Instead they seated another party of 4 on the patio which we had requested, and sat us inside. From the window seat we could see TWO other parties with dogs being seated, one which was cuddled by the host/manager/owner.

We had our last breakfast in town here and it was an excellent way to cap off the day. We didn't have to wait for a table on the patio and our food came quickly. They have an extensive menu with lots of options so everyone in your family should be able to find something they like. Our waitress was also cute as a button and very attentive.

The food is simply mouth watering and delicious. Ofcourse I had the Danish pancakes with powdered sugar (what they are known for) everyday I was there. However the other items available don't just complement the pancakes, they can stand on their own. The Danish sausage and bacon were awesome. Omelettes were tasty. Just writing this makes me want to go back. See you there.",5 star rating,James T.

1/2/2010,"Garden Grove, CA","Solvang is a pretty cool little town to visit. We walked by Paula's pancake House and noticed it was a pretty poppin' place so we decided to stop in for some brunch. I ordered the Danish pancakes with blueberries and the California omelet. The pancakes were really good, i thought it was pretty similar to a crepe, just because it's thinner than the fluffy pancakes I'm used to eating. Blueberries were fresh and yummy, whipped cream was a little too thick and buttery for me, so i scrapped most of it off. But over all it was yummy and i wish the portions were bigger! The omelet was pretty good and it came with a side of hash browns. The omelet i ordered, had cheese, chilly peppers, avocado, salsa, sour cream. Its a pretty standard nothing spectacular. I liked the pancakes much better... So If you're ever in the Santa Barbara area, I definitely recommend taking a trip out to Solvang, to check out the town and try some danish pancakes!",4 star rating,Anne N.

We ordered the Danish omelette and a stack of their light, fluffy, delicious pancakes topped with apple cinammon. The pancakes were to die for! So delicious, fluffy, & satisfying. The Danish omelete was scrumptious with their specialty sausage. Eventhough the line was long, our wait was less than 5 minutes! I would definitely come here again!

The ortega sandwich didn't have a drop of flavor. Some seasonings while cooking the beef could have made a world of difference. I'll never go there again.

We got to Paula's around 10:30 am and there was a long line. We put down our names and we were told the wait time was ~45 minutes. We wandered around the town for half an hour and came back just in time to have the brunch. We were seated outside and it was a perfect warm December morning to be outside. My husband ordered Danish pancake combination and I got Solvang danish style sausage and eggs plus the freshly squeezed orange juice. The juice was as the name suggested; very fresh and better than bottled juices. The food came in about 15 minutes. Danish pancakes were huge but thin (felt like crepes but thicker than those). They tasted delicious! The food item that blew us away was the Danish sausage. It tasted like a brat and was bigger than regular breakfast sausages. The bacon they served tasted different but very tasty with some spices on  it. All in all we loved the food, service and ambience. We would definitely go back to this place if we are in Solvang!",5 star rating,Mona S.

9/2/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","I just recently returned from another trip to Solvang (my 12th). This time I took along two of my good girlfriends with me. I was desperately in the mood for pancakes and I just needed to get away from the bustle of LA. There is no place on this earth that I know of to find the best pancakes than non other than Paula's Pancake House in Solvang. Road Trip!Paula's pancakes are danish style pancakes. They are thinner than an average buttermilk stack yet fluffier than a crepe. It is a hybrid ""pancrepe"". I did not grow up eating pancakes in my house as a child. I really don't like the taste of traditional pancakes and I think that traditional pancakes are too bready and gummy and they always made me feel heavy and miserable. But Paula's Pancakes is the ""truth"". It's like Goldy Locks and the Three Little Bears. They are not too hard. Not too bready. They are just riiiiight. I always order the Combination platter for 10.75 which includes 2 eggs any style, sausage or bacon and two thin pancakes hanging over a 12"" plate with amber maple syrup.You can add toppings and whipped cream, but I'm a purist when it comes down to eating these pancakes. The buttery taste stands on their own. De'lish. I never feel full after eating these pancakes. It is just the perfect amount of food. Now, I can't speak on  how well their other food options are (and there are a lot of options); because I only drive from LA to eat their pancakes. There is always a line and the wait is about 45 minutes to an hour (so worth it). The staff is all great. The manager ""Dan or Dave"" keeps you entertainted outside as he rustles the people in and out of the place. Be sure to take a few friends when you go to visit. Go hungry. Leave satisfied.",5 star rating,B. M.
8/3/2009,"Pasadena, CA","Oh, Danish Pancakes!  This one is a special place in Solvang and if you want 'em, this is the place to go.  People are willing to come from quite a distance just to have Danish breakfast here and I can see why.  The portions are quite good and I just love how they make these Danish pancakes, which are quite thin, but wide.  The decor is nice and not overly complicated, but really, the whole surrounding area of Solvang is decorative as it is.   Thus, it is nice to eat at the patio to enjoy the view.  Admittedly, indoors or outdoors, it could sometimes feel a little cramped, but let's face it, all good breakfast places are cramped.  I probably wouldn't recommend over 6 people as it can get a tad crowded.  In comic book guy's voice: ""Best Pancake Breakfast Ever!""",5 star rating,Win K.

Guess what? We ended up getting water filled with ice and pancake came with strawberry topping.  The only time we saw her put on a smile was when she brought us the check!! Food was above average and nicely decorated.   One more thing I have to bring up with another waitress serving on another table.  Since my mom and I sat outside, it's a small table with a little basket of packets of salt and sugar on the side.  When cleaning up her table, I guess the waitress notice that her table only left a few of packets.  She literally came to our table and grabbed the basket out with her arm between us while we were still talking and working on our food, without saying NOTHING!  WOW just wow! I gave her the look of ""where's your excuse me??"" , then she did it AGAIN by returning the basket with arm between our faces.  We went there because of the great review on yelp, but ended up very disappointed with the services.  I think their waitress need serious training on customer service!",2 star rating,Kiki W.

We waited about 10 minutes to be seated - outside, of course. We felt like we were in a European outdoor cafe. Most of the guys had the Danish pancakes topped with warm cinnamon apples and whipped cream. which was the ultimate in culinary delectibleness. The pancakes are thin, large and piping hot. These came with maple bacon on the side. My breakfast consisted of corned beef hash and eggs over medium. The corned beef was perfectly prepared, a little crunchy on the outside, filled with onions, potatoes and corn beef - yummo! I was hypnotized by the flavors. Dipping the corned beef in the perfectly cooked eggs and sopping up my plate with the buttery sourdough toast almost sent me to another planet. The wait staff were decked in their traditional Danish costume, they were friendly, and very attentive to our needs. I loved how they did not let our coffee get cold.

Just drop someone off to put your name on the list while another finds parking.Food: Where's Paula? I'd like to marry her. Oh and Paula I prefer breakfast in bed. I'm not a fan of the crowds at your, uh I would have to now say, OUR place. Why? Well, I had the danish Pancake combo. Tasty thin pancakes with a sweet flavor. Not the typical pancakes I'm used to but very good. Would switch to this style of pancake if they were a little more filling. Or just order more. I ate the strawberries as a side rather than put them on the cakes.I also sampled the standard buttermilk pancakes. Nothing to note other than they were above average. But i suppose you add enough butter and syrup to anything and it will taste magical.I also had scrambled eggs. A lot of places overcook scrambled eggs and/or add something (like milk) to them to increase the volume. These were just good old fashioned fresh eggs that as far as i know just plopped out of a chicken the day before from one of the nearby farms.Also sampled the biscuits and gravy. Very good. Different as it had bacon pieces. Which surprised me. But it gives it a ""flatter"" flavor. Not in a bad way. Sausage imparts the seasoning into the gravy. Since bacon is all salt then the flavor is not as pronounced. Again, not in a bad way. Biscuit was a prefect match for this gravy. Flaky and flavorful.Prices were a little high. They are just pancakes and breakfast meats in the end. If a rooty tooty F&F costs 3.99 and they still make a profit then ~7 for a similar combo should be a clue. But then again I hear there is a pancake famine in Denmark...ServiceJust good old service. The only negative to note is that we were served a few minutes after after a table that had ordered 5 minutes after us. And I noticed we ordered pretty much the same things. I believe that this happens sometimes and you just move on. But it's important to share in case someone else has had the same experience. ConvenienceThe only problems that are out of Paula's control are the parking and wait. Parking can be difficult on busy weekends with tourists and their possibly quixotic draw to windmills. Also, I've never been here where there wasn't some kind of wait. This last time was 30 min for a party of four. Couples seem to get seated pretty quickly though. Next time my kids can eat on their own. Since this is a tourist spot it is to be expected. Especially since Neverland Ranch is relatively close. Wait I just lost my appetite. ;)",4 star rating,Ryan L.

Their thin Danish pancakes are excellent and the rest of the breakfast offerings are good.  Good service and patio dining on a nice morning is swell. The next morning we went to Arne's for the aebleskivers, which were good but everything else there was pretty lame. Paula's is a sure fire hit.",4 star rating,Blade M.

10/11/2010,"San Francisco, CA","All food was tasty--whole wheat and danish pancakes were definitely a step above most breakfast places. Wish they more options for fresh fruit--only had strawberries when we were there (which were delicious!), and other fruits were syrupy and straight out of a can.

I opted for the pancakes with sugar and powdered sugar (no fruit). They were thin yet fluffy and soo good. My husband had the danish sausage omelet. I was able to sneak a bite, and it was quite tasty...the Danes make a good sausage. The waitresses are very attentive and always make sure you have what you need.",5 star rating,Heather C.

3/1/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","I love this place.  Very unassuming, despite it's popularity, and the Danish pancakes are really good.If you can get there early, you'll avoid the line.  The wait can be as long as a couple of hours, but if you can roll out of bed and show up by 8:15 as Wifey and I did this past Saturday, you'll be seated right away.Been here twice before (not including the time we showed up at 10 and it was a 2 hour wait so we bailed) and I've never tried anything other than the Danish pancakes, thus my four-star rating since I can't give credit for the other stuff I haven't tasted.  But if you like pancakes, I can't see how you won't like the Danish pancakes here.  They are GOOD.  Wide but thin, they go down quick and delicious.  I always like pancakes, but tend to drown them in syrup (hey, it's how I like em), but find that it isn't necessary to do so with these.The waitress was very nice and about as attentive as she needed to be for us to get what we needed.No doubt I will be going to this place again and again.",4 star rating,Charles T.

3/5/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","The only thing I enjoyed here was the kitsch of being served next door to a windmill by a woman dressed like the little Dutch Girl in a dining room that looked like my grandmother's.  The dining room was largely empty---There was one other table.  Though a number of employees were around, no one checked back until I was ready to leave.  The coffee was served cold.  The bread was cold---Maybe the bread was supposed to be cold, I don't know.  The server was cold.  The wait time to get a table here as described by other Yelpers is baffling to me.  And why did a neighboring merchant recommend Paula's Pancake House to me?  ""Oh, everyone goes to Paula's! So you must go there at least once!"" My guess is that ""everybody goes there"" because ""everybody"" is a tourist who tries it once; furthermore, I suspect that what makes this place successful is its prominent location toward the beginning of town and next door to a windmill.  I was only in Solvang for two days, but from what I experienced, any other restaurant in town would have better food, better service, and more welcoming personnel.",2 star rating,Jeffrey D.

6/5/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Paula's Pancake House is a ""MUST DO"" when visiting the quaint cozy village of Solvang. They serve the most tasty breakfast dishes which will remind you of mom's old home cooking. The restaurant itself is decorated in Danish theme which include the waitresses dressed in Danish attire. The menu is reasonably priced for a tourist driven area. I ordered the Veggie Omelet which includes toast and hash brown potatoes. The entire dish was Amazing! All the veggies still had a bite / crunch to them not all soggy like at other places. The hash browns were crispy. The only small issue I had with the toast was they spread the butter on the toast which I dont eat. The ""WOW FACTOR"" for me in the veggie omelet was the cheese melted inside and on top of the dish! My gf ordered the Danish Pancakes with a side of hash brown. In case you don't know what a Danish Pancake is...allow me to describe. It is a paper thin pancake thinner than a crepe. The flavor is very similar to a buttermilk pancake but not as rich or heavy. Overall, we enjoyed the entire breakfast experience from the food to sitting in the outside patio taking in the slow pace of Solvang. If your in Solvang from 6am-3pm then do yourself a favor and stop by Paula's Pancake House.",4 star rating,Andy S.
4/6/2009,"San Diego, CA","We tried this place after a nice girl's weekend away.  The food was pretty good.  We had (between the 4 of us) buttermilk pancakes 3 stars, danish pancakes 4 stars, eggs 4 stars, danish sausage - not to our liking but quality was good, and country sausage 5 stars.  So based on the food, we would go back.  However, I'd have to say that it did not come close to making up for the poor service.It was Sunday morning so it was packed.  We waited 45 minutes (when they told us 35 minutes) which is ok.  But, it seemed like they were seating people out of order. So it was a little irritating.  When we did get seated, a nice young lady filled up our coffee and then..... nothing.  So much nothing that the cashier 'yelled' at our server to wait on us.  It was all a little uncomfortable.  After they took our order, we were never offered more coffee so I jokingly got up and got the coffee pot and served us all a refill.  Not sure if our server had an off day but we all said we would probably not go back or recommend it.  Too bad, as the food was pretty good.",2 star rating,sarah c.

They even had tapatio hot sauce, one of my favorites. and when i got to the pancake. (now i know why they put ""pancake"" in their name) it was perfect.

9/5/2009,"Santa Rosa, CA","They crammed us into a table right by the cash register where the sun glinting off a parked car unavoidably seen through the doorway was in my eyes. When no one came to serve us after a long while, and I saw another table cleared, I eventually found the hostess to ask if we could move. She grumbled yes and immediately turned her back on us, but did not tell anyone, so we were sitting at the other table with no menus watching the people that they seated at our original table (who had of course arrived long after we did) get served immediately. All I can say is that once we finally got a waitress, she was a good one. Our food arrived very fast, and the pancakes were very good! I do not think there were as many strawberries as I was led to believe from the other yelp reviews, nor was the fruit and whipped cream worth the extra price.

About 5 bites in to it I noticed something black in my pancakes. IT WAS A FLY! Ughhhhh- This was not a fly that just landed in my food, it was a fly that was cooked in my pancake.

It was a sunny December morning, and the patio area was just warming up... so my husband and I decided to bypass the 15 minute wait and sit outside. As soon as we sat down about 5 other parties who were waiting followed. I was impressed at how they handled the large number of tables who all sat down at once. Our coffee was constantly filled and the service was great. As a guest you felt as though they appreciated your business, which you don't always find. But the real treat was the food!! The host joked with us that we were about to have the best breakfast of our lives.... He may have been right. We ordered the Paula's Special - Danish Pancakes with apples and whipped cream - Talk about heaven on a plate! They were outstanding! My husband ordered the Danish omelet with hash-browns and a biscuit! Is was savory and delicious! We liked it so much that we came back the next morning and ordered the same thing! We also bought the Danish pancake mix as some holiday gifts for family. We will be back here the next time we are in Solvang!",5 star rating,Melissa S.

Don't get me wrong, it was tasty...but I just don't get the crack induced quality people are referring to. I give three stars - why? Because like a good movie that all your friends talk up and then when you finally go and see it, you end up being disappointed because you made it out to be so much more than it was, so to was Paula's Pancake House. Also minus one star for the incessant flies that were all over the place. Get a good screen door or something!",3 star rating,Michelle K.

She couldn't hardly wait for us to decide what we wanted for breakfast and once we ordered it took her forever to bring us coffee and juice. It was not too bad of wait for our food to arrive but once it did our server disappeared without refilling our coffee. Barely started eating and she brought us the bill!

We never had Danish sausages--so we were a little put off with the (nutmeg or is it allspice) seasoning.  Love these pancakes--each about the thickness of 3 crepes--and they come with real maple syrup. The strawberry jam is so heavenly, you don't need to pay the extra for the sliced strawberries or blueberry or cinnamon-apple compote with whipped cream. They do sell the jam to take home.",4 star rating,A A.
8/21/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","AVOID THIS PLACE!!!   It gets so crowded that they can't perform proper service.  The lineup of people have full view of people eating outside 3 feet away.  You like to be stared at while you eat?  NO PRIVACY OUTSIDE.  The receptionist could not be heard by the patrons when calling for names.  A 25 minute wait turned into a 50 min. ordeal because we missed our name call.  They don't even have a speaker.  So she fails to call out the names properly.  We finally get a seat inside after I demand one.  It's HOT and HUMID inside.  NO AIR CONDITIONING.   Go there if you like to sit in your own sweat.  Terrible place.  Then our food comes and well...a thin sweet piece of dough is what it is people. WOO HOO!  Enjoy your ""pancakes"".  My breakfast comes and the hashbrowns are burnt both sides.  To keep up with the flow of demand, they CRANK up their burners(an old resteraunt trick).  One side of the sausage was totally burnt.  The scrambled eggs where just like mcdonalds.  The sausage was a preformed rectangle thing, I mean c'mon!  You could just serve Farmer John and be golden, but no, you serve some kind of cheapo thing.   This is not gormet or even high quality food people.  It's total crap.  Crap that cost us $18.00!!!  I saw nothing Danish in what we ordered.  The crowds, the wait, the inability of the receptionist to do her job, the sweatshop inside.  I make a better breakfast than this place at home, every time guaranteed.  ZERO STARS.",1 star rating,Derek T.

Although they are obviously known for their pancakes, I could not help bu order the french toast. It just sounded too good, and it was! The breakfast is filling, delicious, and I savored every piece til the last bite. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice, so if you are a fan of OJ you will regret not getting a glass or two with breakfast. The food was served fresh off the stove, and the service was timely. Everything was priced very reasonably, and our bill was very low considering the amount of food ordered!

6/3/2011,"Long Beach, CA",Once again while on my road trip up the California Coast I turned to yelp to help decide my meal choice. Paula's Pancake House is obviously very good otherwise they wouldn't have a minimum wait of around 40 minutes for just two people. If you have a larger group expect a wait time upwards of an hour. If you are impatient then don't even bother trying Paula's. I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak and eggs were decent but nothing wowed me. It was just your basic breakfast.  The Danish pancakes did wow me.  Unfortunately the wow factor was not enough to justify such a long wait time.  For this reason I give Paula's a four star rating. One word of advice while waiting stay close to hear your name to be called.  Several people lost their tables because they were not there when their name was called and they moved through names faster than anticipated. Some of the people left to shop while waiting for their table and came back to find that they had lost their place.  Our original wait time of 50 minutes turned into a 35 minute wait as people lost their tables.,4 star rating,Frank V.

I was looking for a place to grab a good breakfast before I had to make my long drive back home, and my uncle recommended this Paula's. I really liked the look of this place, kinda had that small town feel. Paula's doesn't have there own parking lot but I easily found a spot on the street. I took a seat at the bar and was instantly greeted, handed a menu and asked if i wanted some coffee. I ordered the pancake combo meal that came with homemade sausage and a fresh squeezed orange juice. My meal came out really fast and the pancakes were huge, the eggs were great and the sausage was amazing. The O.J. tasted really fresh and sweet, i really feel like my whole meal tasted great and was portions were really big. The food is a little pricey but i think it was worth it, the orange juice was a bit overpriced, so I think next time I'm in the area I will try to make a stop here again.",4 star rating,Joey K.

4/1/2007,"Mount Shasta, CA","I love me some Paula's breakfast. My boyfriend and I rolled out of bed on a gorgeous Sunday morning just as the front desk was calling to let us know we were already an hour past check out time. We threw our stuff in the car and stumbled down the street to popular and friendly Paula's where we got an intimate table for 2 outside by a pretty little flowerbed near the sidewalk. We had a super delicious meal of apple/cinamon pancakes and an egg breakfast. Everything was yummy and the best part was watching all the weird, well, let's say eccentric Solvang tourists cruise by. Our favorite was the guy with a full, thinning head of hair that was brushed all the way forward and only stayed due to the amount of hairspray he used to plaster it in place. His part started 2 inces above the back of his neck and went up the side sporting a classic side ponytail, minus the tail. If you're looking for some fun people watching while eating, sit outside and have a bite at Paula's.  Flabulous!",4 star rating,Hamsa D.

4/25/2011,"Grover Beach, CA","Made a trip to Solvang and read Yelp reviews raving about their pancakes but warning about their so-so service and a long wait time. These all came to be true.Wait Time:Went on a Sunday (Easter) at about noon and the wait was about 45 minutes. That was no problem as we walked around Solvang.Food: I ordered the Danish Pancakes with strawberries. Very good and very filling. Great pancakes for sure. Wife ordered the corned beef with eggs. Corned beef was served in a circle shape as it was cooked in some kind of cookie cutter type thing. It was okay but not that great. Son had the veggie omelet with hash brown. It was fine but nothing great.Service:Well we were called and made it to the door to get our seats and the host said, ""Oh, I already called your name."" He called us about 45 seconds before and we were making our way through the crowd to get to him. Luckily our seat was not given away. Our waitress was good as she greeted us and took our orders promptly. I read Yelpers saying that once you get your food you don't see your waitress again. This was literally the case. They must have changed shifts because we never saw her again and no new waitress took over our table. Not a single waitress came to our table at all while we ate. This was okay because we ended up not needing anything but if we did we would have had to track down somebody. So we waited for our check, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally somebody came and we asked for a box for leftovers and our check please. She came back with a box but no check. So finally we went to the front and let them know we needed our check. They ended up charging us for the wrong tab so we corrected them and they charged us for our actual tab. They said they would void the first one. Well I looked at our banking account summary today and BOTH tabs are on there. So I call my bank and they void it for me in a few minutes. Sadly I had better customer service from a Wells Fargo phone agent than anybody at the restaurant. Overall: The pancakes are good. The service was non existent. The food is pretty pricey so we will not be returning.",2 star rating,Sergio G.

6/12/2012,"Thousand Oaks, CA","In a word, disgusting. Paula's may be the highest-rated restaurant in Solvang when you consider both the number of reviews and the star rating, but out of everything I did on my trip, it's the one place where I felt like I threw away my money. We had two orders of Danish pancakes, one plain and one with Danish sausage. They were dry and lukewarm. The sausage was an unappetizing grayish-brown color and had some hard bits in it that someone could break a tooth on. The coffee was bland and there were flies buzzing around. The decor looks like it hasn't been touched since 1970--the restaurant could use some serious sprucing up. In the bathroom, there was a toilet brush sitting on the floor in a yogurt container and I suddenly felt like I was in an episode of Restaurant Impossible. I can't believe we blew $25 at this place when we could have spent that money on some fantastic pastries next door at Olsen's.",1 star rating,A. F.

I ordered the strawberry danish pancakes which came with whipped cream, a side order of potatoes, and a mimosa (they have a 2 for 10 mimosa deal!). The pancakes were far larger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise! However, I was not a fan of the cream as it had the consistency/taste of vanilla custard rather than a light airy texture. In addition, my table never received their mimosas. All in all, an average option for hungry travelers passing through the Danish town.",3 star rating,Gurpreet L.

Friday morning wasn't as bad as I anticipated but was pretty busy as we would have had a small wait had we not opted to sit on the patio outside. I went for a breakfast of pancakes with strawberries, eggs, and bacon. Portions are generous and everything was cooked perfectly. Food came hot which I really appreciate. The wait for the food itself was a little long but being that it was hot and fresh I didn't mind it. They have Danish pancakes which I wish I would have ventured out for. I believe they are  thinner than regular pancakes and I heard really good but that will be for next time.They offer Danish sauges as well which was much thicker than a regular breakfast sausage link.

6/7/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","This quaint little hot spot was full when we got there. After a few days of showers and attempts to, it turned into a sunny June morning. The patio was filled already so we took a seat inside.My friend ordered the french toast which looked great & even though I am on Weight Watchers I had to try the Danish Pancakes that seemed to be what they are known for and was not disappointed. I have this trick, I always ask for mine ""light"" so that they know better than to try to hide a burnt side down (which has happened to me more than a dozen times) Anyway, another trick when ordering things I know are not exactly off of the ww list I allow myself (especially before a weigh in day which is today.... grrrr.) I eat until I feel full and then throw the napkin on the plate so that the plate will be taken away before I start ""picking""! Also there was something about the syrup that was reeeeally good. It was lighter than your usual thick syrup and sooo good.The service was great and it was just a great place to catch up with a friend you hadn't seen for a looong time. I will definitely add it to my list of ""go to"" places when in Solvang!",4 star rating,Di R.

11/23/2016,"San Diego, CA","My husband and o decided to try Paula's Pancakes after reading Yelp reviews. We were doing a CA coast trip and Solvang was our first stop for breakfast. We arrived around 8:40 on a Saturday morning and there were a lot of people waiting outside already. We didn't wait too long because they sat us outside. It was beautiful to sit outside and enjoy the chilly fall weather. We ordered the pancake special which includes Danish pancakes, eggs, bacon, A side order of biscuit and gravy and hash browns. Everything was delicious! The pancakes were thin and tasty. Different from buttermilk pancakes. The syrup was nice and light and complimented the pancakes. Biscuit and gravy was really good because they used danish sausage. Food was delicious and would definitely recommend eating here! Waitress and hostess were nice too.",4 star rating,Araceli R.

8/24/2017,"Chula Vista, CA","This used to be the place we would go to and willingly wait to have breakfast. The last two visits have changed our mind. Never again. During the first incident a few months ago, we asked to be seated outside to avoid the wait time but the hostess said no. She indicated it might rain. After waiting another 40 minutes, she seated a couple outside and continued to skip our table of five until we pointed it out to her. During the second incident on August 19th, we waited OVER 90 minutes before we got seated. We watched as the hostess skipped us and seated both smaller and larger groups. When we finally got seated and explained what happened, the older female manager shrugged and said ""I already told you I am sorry, what else do you want?"" and proceeded to defend herself saying she had ""called"" our table and gave our table away when we didn't answer. Mind you, I stood 6 feet away from the door so I could see and hear her. I waited 40 minutes before I began going up to her to ask how much longer we'd have to wait. I went up there 3 times and on the 4th time, I was informed that she called my group and skipped us for not answering. And the kicker? We were told we would get the next table and watched as she seated two tables of four and one table of two. By then, my sister got involved and clearly informed her if we didn't get seated soon, it was going to get ugly and we'd make sure to tell all our Marine buddies to skip this place. Paula can take someone else's money. We will never come back. Save your valuable time and hard-earned money and try Mother Hubbard's in Buellton. They use local produce and take good care of their customers. They'll also do you right if you aren't completely happy about any aspect of your visit. You certainly won't get shrugged off like rif-raf.",1 star rating,Dzuyen T.

I love breakfast, its probably my favorite meal so then we were driving in, I saw pancake and said, lets go there! we walked in and took a seat on the patio. I ordered the waffle and sausage combo, and bf ordered a cheeseburger. best, freshest waffle and sausage I've ever had and bf enjoyed his burger. our server was great (sorry I forgot her name but she has dark hair) and super friendly.

11/20/2010,"Tustin, CA","This is one of the few times Yelp reviews have led me astray. So sad.On a weekend away with the wife, we headed into Solvang to walk the streets, pretend we were in northern Europe and eat some pancakes.We were sat quickly. The server was quick to show. The food arrived relatively quickly. The outdoor patio facing the main drag into town was somewhat charming.There ends the high points.We ordered the Danish Pancake Combination. The syrup was horrible. It tasted like straight corn syrup. The butter was equally horrible. I kept thinking, ""Why are people waiting in line for this?"" The sausage was odd and lacked taste, but I think that was its Danish nature.Anyways, there a so many other unique places to try in Solvang, I would skip this tourist hotspot and try other local eateries.",2 star rating,Ryder S.
3/30/2016,"Ventura, CA",My kids had pancakes and Danish pancakes.  They both looked good.  My husband and I both ordered the Danish sausage omelette.  The sausage is different.  I tried to eat it all and give it a chance but it had a weird consistency and flavor.  On the long drive home I dreamt about taking Tums.  I just did and took note to never eat Danish sausage again.,3 star rating,Melissa F.
12/4/2014,"Los Angeles, CA",Outstanding and well worth the wait. The Danish pancakes are thinner and slightly more salty than sweet american style cakes. great with the sauteed apples & whipped cream. my hubs loved the sausage & eggs...really good food here.,5 star rating,Leslie C.
9/2/2011,"Seattle, WA","So good. Seriously. The Danish pancakes are soft and thin and tasty. They reminded me of crepes and I loved every minute of it.  I got them smothered in Cinnamon Apples. :oDThe Danish sausages are sweet and available to buy in bulk so you can take the goodness with you.  My boyfriend got the corned beef, with over-easy eggs and hashbrowns. We ate everything and washed it down with some amazing diner coffee.",4 star rating,Denise S.
3/27/2016,"Orange County, CA","Worth it to come eat breakfast and experience Paula's Pancake House.  The atmosphere is sweet, service excellent and the food is delicious.  We ordered regular pancakes, Danish pancakes (which I recommend), hasbrowns (yum!), coffee (worth it if you enjoy coffee with breakfast), thick bacon and sausage.  All of us enjoyed our meals tremendously. Luckily we got in early, before the huge queue, but I would definitely come back here if I visit Solvang again!!!!",5 star rating,Joy T.

5/14/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","As Jonathan Y. has attested to, this is THE place to come for breakfast in Solvang! I had the good fortune of being seated immediately by coming here at 11am on a weekday. I got the Danish pancake combination (two Danish pancakes, sausage or bacon, and 2 eggs) which was delicious! The pancakes were of intermediate thickness (in between crepes and regular pancakes) and dusted with powdered sugar. Simple but perfect; they were so good by themselves that I didn't even need to pour any syrup over them (although you could get them topped with fruit if that's your thing). I'm a fan!",4 star rating,Lillian C.
3/24/2016,"Costa Mesa, CA","I'm not typically a pancake person, but this was a really great pancake. Coffee was good! Waffle was just Ok, I would definitely roll with the Paula's special!

7/10/2014,"Simi Valley, CA","Can I give this place a 10 star rating? The food? Amazing. The service? Spot on.Hubby and I were in Solvang for my birthday, and based on Yelp reviews decided to eat here for breakfast. We got there at about 10 on Wednesday, and they were packed. Luckily, we got a table in the back after a short 10 minute wait. Cutest little restaurant, makes you feel like you're at Grammas house. Server was Katherine, she was AWESOME. She had our drinks out in 3 min flat... FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!!! OMG!!!! Hubby ordered the Irish Benedicts, which he promptly devoured. I had the Danish pancakes with the Country Pork Sausage. Sausage was the best I've had at a breakfast place, pancakes were really good. Much lighter than normal pancakes so you dont get that gummy full feeling after eating them. If I HAD to make a critique? The maple syrup was a little too sweet for me.  Total came to about $30 for the 2 of us. WELL worth the price. Will I return? You kidding? I'm already planning my next breakfast there!! PLEASE GO. You will NOT be disappointed!!",5 star rating,Torrie S.

Danish pancakes were fresh out of oven. We also ordered bear claws for snack on the road and they tasted so good even after 3 hours of travel. Everyone dresses Danish and greeted us with beautiful smells. I would recommend Paula's as the first choice to breakfast/brunch or lunch when you are staying the night in Solvang. Definitely the highlight of the trip.",5 star rating,Shuyang C.
10/11/2018,"Buellton, CA","I was there for an hour and a half. The waitress gave me one cup of coffee at the counter. Spent the rest of the time flirting with some man apparently that she knew. I put a $20 bill on the table, which was at least 100% including a very generous 1/3 tip. Which she didn't deserve. Since she never ever acknowledged me. I just called them and they accused me of not paying my bill. The manager ""accused me of leaving without paying my bill. If there are unscrupulous people at The restaurant, that's not my problem. Be very careful at this restaurant. There are very unscrupulous people working there. I will go back there, and pay another $20 just to clear any ridiculous accusation they are pointing at me. they think I/O them. So sad that once a reputational business has fallen so far.

7/2/2012,"San Diego, CA","This place singlehandedly saves Solvang's food reputation (besides Root 246). I wasn't too impressed by the food selection in Solvang till I tried breakfast here. My bf told me he has never seen me scarf down a plate of pancakes faster than I have at Paula's. There seems to always be a crowd waiting outside this restaurant, which wasn't an issue for us since we were just staying across the street. So my bf and I just put our name down with the quirky guy in charge at the front and looked around. The two times we came here it only took us about 10-15 min to be called. Not bad!I ordered the Danish Style Pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream and ate the whole thing in less than 10 min. The whipped cream here is soooooo good. The second time I came here I ordered the Danish Style Pancake combo with whipped cream on the side and was stuffed. I asked for the Danish sausage with the pancakes and put the sausage on the plate with my eggs and just ate the pancakes with the whipped cream. I ended up being SO FULL. The guy who is in charge of seating people here is super funny and friendly. If you are waiting you have to chat it up with him because some of the things he says are just priceless.",5 star rating,Katrina L.

3/9/2014,"Whittier, CA","Terrible service. The server placed the check down at the table moments after placing our food at the table. She never checked on how we were doing or if we needed anything (which we did). The bacon was burned, pancakes are ordinary and they only have two waffle makers for the entire restaurant. It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive. everyone there is a huge hurry that they bump into everyone. I'm surprised they don't yell 'Move outta the way"".",2 star rating,Caroline G.

We check in as it was very busy, we were told 10 min for a table inside, try 30 min. To be fair had we chosen a table outside our wait would have been much less. Once seated the noise was really hard to bear. One more thing they seated us at a 4seat table and we had only two persons. There were other two seat tables unoccupied. The food was mediocre at best, really, miss this place",2 star rating,Derek O.

9/11/2009,"Seattle, WA","Very good food and nice little restaurant. We came here in lieu of the carb infested complementary breakfast that our hotel offered. Food was very good. I knocked a point off for a few reasons...I'm picky with my bacon, I like it crispy, and theirs was like rubber. But I was satisfied with their eggs, hash browns and toast. When we got there, we asked for a table for two outside. It was a very pretty day out. They seated us at a tiny little table right in between a planter and a cart that held an ice chest and silverware. This was SUPER noisy. We did ask to move, and eventually did when a table opened up. Our waitress was a little slow, but friendly. Our food was quick, but she was a little slow on things like taking our order, refills and bringing our bill. The problem with hiring a bunch of young ladies that all look relatively the same, and then making them dress the same...is that you have a hard time figuring out who your waitress is. All in all, I really liked this place and will definitely return next time I'm in town. And next time, I'll take everyone's recommendations and try the Danish Pancakes. They looked good, but I just don't like to start my day out with so much starch. Maybe for lunch though!",4 star rating,Heather K.
10/1/2016,"CA, CA","Finally tried the always packed pancake house in Solvang. I will be honest and kind. Nothing special except they have a great location in a town that dumps a ton of tourists from a lot of buses daily. I had the pancake combo with scrambled eggs and bacon. Eggs average, the bacon wasn't burnt which was nice but the first bite of pancake was off. Mushy and just not good at all. I know it's just a pancake but with that in their name I expected at least an average pancake. I know they will still be busy because if it looks busy it must be good, right? Well, it's not. In their defense I had buttermilk, not a Danish pancake, but I'm Danish and I prefer a thick buttermilk to a thin Danish. If you want a good pancake go to Jeanine's in Santa Barbara but if you're already there try the Danish pancake.",2 star rating,Brandi S.

9/30/2014,"Lompoc, CA","Had brunch here on a Monday morning and the place was packed. This place definitely needs an upgrade though (decor and furniture are outdated) and some thorough cleaning. My wife had hash browns and sauteed vegetables: they were a little too greasy and the potatoes could have been cooked a minute longer. My steak and egg special of the day was good, I ordered a side of pancakes too. The recipe for the pancakes is good, too bad they serve them with the cheapest maple syrup imitation I've ever tasted. We found out they recently switched to a different brand, which is not meeting people's expectations. Considering how popular and pricey this restaurant is, they should have no problems using a better quality condiment, especially if pancakes are one of their hot selling items. Great location and lots of potential for improvement.",3 star rating,Carl J.

I found Paula's through yelp - so here's my review.We loved it. What a great way to make the drive feel like part of the adventure. I let my daughter have breakfast for lunch and at the end we shared a danish pancake with apple mash and ice cream... there is nothing more to say. It was fabulous.
