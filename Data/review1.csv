5/22/2021,"Huntington Beach, CA",I came here for dinner craving some enchiladas. There wasn't any line when ordering take out and the hostesses were really nice and funny.It took around 15 minutes for the food to be prepared and they have a super organized take out system with somebody manning that station. The enchiladas came with some rice that absolutely blew me away. The perfect orange tint with the powerful flavor of lime was perfect with the mild refried beans sitting atop the crunchy tostada shell. The enchiladas came with green sauce and had perfectly tender chicken.This is definitely the spot I frequent when in the area and I love coming here!,5 star rating,Brianna S.
3/10/2021,"Los Altos, CA","W-O-W. This place will knock your socks off. I came here on a Friday night around 6:30PM and the place was popping, but the line moves fast. Half the people there are ordering or waiting for their takeout when I went, but YMMV. The parking lot is TINY (like under 8 spots I believe) so you will probably have to end up finding street parking. We parked a block over on a side street and walked over but definitely bumper to bumper parking, it's tight.I've came to Santa Barbara a few times but surprisingly have never tried Los Agaves. This is pretty much like the #1 rated place to eat on Yelp in Santa Barbara, so I knew I had to check it out. You can order at the counter and they give you a number to self seat in their back patio. I ordered the camarones guajillo and a strawberry margarita (FYI they have happy hour 11AM-5PM everyday for their margs). My friend ordered the Enchiladas Guadalajara.We were easily able to find a spot in the back patio, and were promptly served with chips and a few sauces. I loved their green sauce it was so good. We really devoured the whole basket and even asked for more sauce! The food did take about 40 minutes to come out, but the chips definitely shortened the wait. I also got my strawberry margarita within minutes, and it was delicious! Not so much strawberry taste as their was alcohol, it was pretty strong LOL and I only got a small. I loved the tajin rim, it added a nice touch.Anyway, our food finally comes and we are geeked! Like definitely ate a good amount of chips to be somewhat not hungry but I didn't come here for chips! Lol. My dish was MOUTHWATERING AMAZING. The sauce the shrimp came in was actually so delicious. The shrimp was so juicy and cooked to perfection. I loved the diced pineapples within the dish too as the sweetness complimented the shrimp very well. The guajillo chilis were very mild and I was able to eat them. The dish also came with a side of rice and their house salad. I don't know why but the rice was SO freaking good! Loved the cotija(?) cheese on top. The house salad was also delicious. It was very sweet and more of like a ""fruit"" salad. The entire dish was so amazing. My friend loved her enchiladas too, but it definitely seemed more of a basic dish. But also a solid staple you can't go wrong with.Los Agaves is THE place to be. Like I have never had Mexican food this good and I will be dreaming about this until the day I come back. THANK YOU LOS AGAVES!!",5 star rating,Serina L.
3/13/2021,"Irvine, CA",Amazing spot for food if you're in Santa Barbara! We got a takeout. We called ahead and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes. The food was legit!! The Camaronnes Ala Diablo was authentically spicy! So beware!!The cheese quesadillas were crunchy and a hit with my tired hungry kids. The salsa and guacamole that came with it was sooo good!Pricey but worth it!,5 star rating,Lizelle P.
5/23/2021,"South San Francisco, CA","THE AL PASTOR TACO.Ok, ok, so this place looked expensive and we were hesitant to get a large dish. Plus, we had a toooon of other food stops, so just got the tacos for a try. An al pastor taco can tell you a lot.THIS TACO had cheese on top of the tortilla, then the marinated Al pastor + pineapple + AND and extra sauce. There was so spit roast, but this place was scrumdidlyumptious.Maybe we just got the right thing or maybe this place does other amazing dishes. The CA Burrito did have rice though, so tbd on our next visit.",5 star rating,Christina L.
5/22/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA",Good local food. Big size portions but lack customer service.Today I ordered two family meals online around 3:15 it said it would be be ready at 4:04 we showed up at 4:10 and they hadn't started our order yet. They said it would be 15 mins but offered no apology. Food was not ready ready till 4:40. I asked to cancel the order but said they don't offer refunds since I had already paid I would have been out the money.This is not the first time they have been rude. They need to up their customer service and get orders out on time.,2 star rating,Marlene D.
4/24/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!! Came from LA to visit Santa Barbara for the weekend and this place was a TERRIBLE START TO LUNCH! THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR VEGETARIAN FOOD! There are hardly any vegetarian options. We ordered the nachos and quesadillas. The nachos were not great and everything just had a lot of cheese especially, the quesadillas. Quesadillas were not at all warm and the cheese was just solid. I ended up paying $9.73 for the Guacamole that is ""Market Priced"" was so disappointing as you clearly see under the pictures. Even our server said that the Guacamole should have been around $3.00-4.00. The one sad option they have for tacos is the Taco Rajas Con Queso which looks so unappetizing, I would not order this again. Fajitas were so hard to digest. I would highly suggest not coming here if you are vegetarian/vegan.",1 star rating,Rupa S.
5/27/2021,"Buena Park, CA","Nice spot, but disappointed with the quality. My burrito was very sloppy and lacked flavor. I opted for the fajita burrito. I didn't like that the sour cream, lettuce, salsa, was all on the side and not put inside the burrito. Why not just put it in the burrito? Also got hit with food poisoning 2 hours after. On an upside their margaritas were delicious!",2 star rating,Andrew C.
3/19/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","After hiking the Dragon's back (3 peaks loop: Arlington, La Cumbre & Cathedral) nearby, my friends and I decided on picking up an early dinner at Los Agaves. We arrived on a Saturday around 5pm and got in line to place our orders at the front counter. First come, first serve outside dining and luckily several tables available to accommodate our party of 8.  I ordered a tostada salad with shrimp ($10.50, add $7 for the shrimp) and a single Jalisco Margarita ($10.50): fresh squeezed lime juice, tequila, triple sec, and agave nectar. Jalisco Margarita is weak and watered down.  My tostada was good and it came with a slightly sweet, creamy dressing on the side.  Shrimps were big and tasty.  Honestly, the free chips and several different salsa are my favorites. Not because they were free, lol.  See my pic -two of the salsas (there were 4) featured on my plate were the spiciest and taste the best.  Very small, free parking lot.  You're best bet is to find free street parking around the restaurant.  Overall, it was good enough restaurant to have a post-adventure meal at.  Stay safe and healthy (mind, body and soul) Yelping out there :)",4 star rating,Jules B.
5/3/2021,"Pleasanton, CA",Love this spot for lunch! I ordered the Tacos Del Mar with shrimp & loved it. It was super busy when we were there so they forgot to bring out our drinks but the ladies were so nice and helpful whenever we asked for extra salsa or for our drinks. They have great drinks and specials as well. Definitely a 10/10 spot For a lunch and a more casual dinner spot.,5 star rating,Emma W.
5/13/2021,"Placerville, CA","Super fresh ingredients! One of the best Mexican restaurants we have ever been to. Can't wait to go back...wish there was something that caliber in Sacramento area.Plenty of outdoor seatings and safely spaced out. Friendly customer service. As soon as we ordered the food on the counter, walked out to patio in the back, waitress immediately helped us clean a table and seated us. Free chips and salsas and didn't wait long for our entrees to be served. Best horchata ever. Don't miss ~",5 star rating,D H.
3/11/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Glad this place is still open in covid. Have both takeout and outdoor dining available. The outdoor patio has heaters & a very spacious and clean space. Few parking spots located in the back. The workers were very friendly.Complimentary chips & salsa were delicious. Paired great with a yummy jaritos drink. CALIFORNIA BURRITO [4 stars] ****I didn't realize there would be cactus in the burrito. Would have ordered this one the side. I requested for the fries to be cooked extra crispy/more done. Think this helped add a good texture. If I could make on more edit I wish the Spanish rice was inside the burrito versus on the plate.CHICKEN ENCHILADAS [5 stars] *****Very cheesy, great sauce. The tostada bowl of beans was nice. Excellent rice.",5 star rating,Tiffany A.
2/11/2021,"Glendale, CA","Walked in on a Sunday with 2 friends. We found this place based on Yelp reviews and the reviews were not wrong. Considering social distancing and all the rules they were doing a good job in their outdoor sitting behind the building. We asked for recommendations and the person behind the counter recommended these foods. Everything was great, tasted amazing and fresh. If you're in Santa Barbara this is a must visit place.",5 star rating,Annie A.

2/14/2021,"Burbank, CA",Who knew Santa Barbara has better Mexican food than LA! This place rocks and we're always stopping by for Mexican delicacies esp the nachos - they have amazing ingredients and the best habanero salsa - we get them and a couple of mexi brews every time we're in Santa Barbara...don't pass this spot up. They rock,5 star rating,Alejandro L.

3/23/2021,"San Mateo, CA",I can totally see why this place is raved about this restaurant. The food is off the chain to say it simply.  The ordering process was easy. We walked in and was offered a menu and just had to wait in line. The. We ordered at the counter and was given a number. We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio.We were greeted and given chips and salsa and a green salsa/sauce. It was delicious. The chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious! Sooooo good! My husband and I kept saying how good it was. Then our food came out and we both got chicken enchiladas. He for it with green sauce and I got red sauce over it. It also came with beans and rice. Wow! The meal was scrumptious! I was so delighted by the meal and could totally understand why this place had high marks. We throughly enjoyed our meal and loved the whole experience. It truly was pleasant. We definitely will go back whenever in the area.,5 star rating,Ida S.
1/10/2021,"Berkeley, CA","What a MEAL!!My boyfriend took me here because he tried their signature Agaves Burrito a couple years back when he visited and it was one of the most memorable meals from that trip. Let me say, the food here did not disappoint. We decided to treat ourselves and ordered 3 entrees, and our order came with the usual complimentary chips with 4 different types of sauces (red sauce, green sauce, pico de gallo, and a darker salty sauce I'm not familiar with!)Agaves Burrito: They drenched that thing in their amazing chipotle sauce. It came with a side of rice and salad. You never usually expect much out of a side salad, but this one was actually pretty good! It had dried cranberries, tangerines, corn- and all the flavors worked very well together. As for the burrito itself, the fillings definitely were not distributed very well (one end of the burrito was all lettuce, and the other end was all the good stuff like shrimp/fish/guac,) but altogether it was very delicious.Mole Enchiladas: All their sauces are a hit, and the mole is no exception. It has that beautiful smoky sweetness, and came with a side of rice and beans. Chile Poblano Campestre: Looks-wise, not really sure what it is the way they presented it, but eating it was delicious! The description lists it as 2 corn tortillas with a poblano chile stuffed with meat and cheese, but in reality it was more like they cut the chile in half and flattened it, then put a layer of meat and cheese on top.",4 star rating,Michelle H.

5/11/2021,"Aliso Viejo, CA","We finally got the chance to try Los agaves after the first attempt going horribly wrong at the other location a few months ago (1.5 hour wait, no food, we left starving). Food: We ordered the Chile Poblano Campestre with steak- delicious! Grilled perfectly with a fragrant smoky grill flavor, topped with cheese. Yummy. Al pastor tacos- i thought it was pretty good but my boyfriend loved it. He said it was the best al pastor he's had. Also got an order of their beef taquitos. This was very good but the tortilla was a bit too thick. Service: when we walked up it was confusing because we didn't know if we should wait to get seated or walk up and order then seat like the other location. A server finally noticed us and told us to order first. We walked up to the register to order and the person taking the order was not paying attention so she didn't notice us for about 2 minutes. She seemed either still new and learning or distracted because she had a hard time understanding our order, which was nothing special. Just ordered straight from the menu. She was still nice nonetheless. The reason for the 4 stars is the inside seating area was a bit dirty. Their walls where we sat near the front entrance had tons of food stains and actual caked on food. We looked around and all the walls were dirty. Floors needed to be swept too. Overall- delicious food! Needs better service and clean your walls lol",4 star rating,Young N.
5/21/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm trying really hard not to be a ""Karen"" through the horrible experience I had trying to dine here tonight. I walked up the counter, asked the cashier what she recommended, she said quesobirria tacos and that's exactly what I got. Sat down outside and patiently waited for my food. Had some decent chips and salsa and 20 mins pass by and waiter asks if I need anything. I said yes can I have some ice water? He said of course. Another 25 mins pass by and I have no food or water. 5 mins after, he comes by and says they actually ran out of the quesobirria tacos and if I'd like anything else from the menu? Sooo if that's the case, why did I take 45 mins after I had ordered to be told this? And he said because they just started on my order. You're telling me it took this restaurant 45 mins to actually even look at my order and see that they didn't have what I had already paid for? How absurd. At that point I just picked the most expensive thing out of annoyance and asked him if I could get it to go since my appetite was long gone after that. He said sure and that' it would be another 10 mins to make my food and sure enough, my food rolled out in 10 mins. It's just not adding up for me and the food wasn't even all that great after that sour taste this place left me with. I'm really not one to take time with negative reviews but I just had to with this experience. Will definitely not be returning.",1 star rating,Lily O.
11/21/2020,"San Mateo, CA","With 4.5 stars and 3.5k reviews, we were excited to try this restaurant. We kept saying that we must've ordered the wrong things, since we couldn't see what all of the hype was about. We thought the food was ""decent"". They give you complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and my boyfriend ordered the burrito mojado with angus steak. Fajitas came with 6 big shrimp on a hot platter. The shrimp were nicely cooked, but there wasn't any wow factor to me. There was a lot of tender beef in the burrito, but could've been more seasoned. My boyfriend felt like the meat was just seasoned with salt and covered in jarred tomato sauce. The food isn't cheap either. Unfortunately, we left unsatisfied after our first dinner during our trip in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Lauren N.
10/3/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I accidentally ordered takeout from here when I intended to order from the De La Vina location. I already knew that this location was most likely going to have a huge line out the door. I ordered takeout so I was hoping the wait wasn't long. They don't have a great system for takeout and I ended up waiting around 15 minutes outside. A man who seemed like a manager was calling out names, but when he left the workers were calling names from inside. It was problematic because no one outside could hear anything. I hope they will improve this system because it is confusing.I ordered the nachos with al pastor, and a side of rice. I love their rice but the way it was packed was comical to me. I feel like they should have packed it in a smaller box, or put it in one of those corn tortilla bowls. The way they packed it also made it seem like they didn't give very much food. The nachos are good, and the portions are generous. It is a bummer that it took so long to checkout because the chips were a bit soggy. For anyone looking for a dine-in experience, they have some indoor and outdoor seating available. The staff all wears masks so it felt safe. Just beware when it is busy there are a lot of people inside.",4 star rating,Lianna M.
9/20/2020,"Anaheim, CA","It's interesting to me how there are soooo many Mexican food options here in SB! During my recent road trip to Santa Barbara, our friends had recommended us to stop by Los Agaves and try out their food. We figured we had to at least try one of the mexican food stops, and decided to make this our lunch stop. We opted to dine in, and since it was a relatively late lunch for us, we lucked out for happy hour. The online menu was slightly outdated, as it reflected $5 for a small margarita whereas it actually cost us $7.50 when we ordered. Nonetheless, it's totally worth it since the drinks were pretty strong! We ordered a few shareable items and sat outside in the patio. As per usual, we were served chips and salsa - ugh, which is always my weakness. We had ordered a mole enchilada, and a lamb and beef taco sampler plate that the hostess had recommended. Whether if you would like to order for take out or dine in, you order through their cashier and then either wait at the front, or take your number and pick a table to sit down in their patio in the back. I'd have to be honest, I've never had mole sauce before. I didn't really know what flavor to expect, and the dark brownish sauce was very intriguing. It looks like their mole sauce was also a crowd favorite, and I can totally see why! The mole sauce was tangy and savory, it wasn't toooo wet but just moist enough to eat with the enchilada. It wasn't too messy to eat either! I ended up liking it so much that I scooped up all the mole sauce was the chips!The beef taco was meh, but I really liked the lamb taco. It had so much flavor! Although we only had two items and a few more drinks, we really enjoyed our time at Los Agaves. I can see why it was a crowd favorite during pre-quarantine times!",4 star rating,Katherine L.
9/5/2020,"Orange County, CA","- Locale Destination - It's on N Milpas st and E Cota St in Santa Barbara. It was close to where we stayed. Not too far away from downtown. It's in a quiet area right close to residential areas. It's on the corner. Ambiance: very casual ( outside seating). Tiny bar inside. Service: Friendly, quickParking: rear the building, but plenty of free street parking. - Gluttony Expedition -Shrimp Molecajete: I've been craving for this dish because one of the Frida was closed when I tried to get it. Compared to the one at Frida, this tasted nothing but tomato. Lacked in flavors. Unlike Frida, very little ingredients: tiny avocado (1/4) and little shredded cheese, 1 jalapeño, some big shrimps, green onions, cactus. Not enough stuff. Frida is so bomb, so this was super disappointing. Chips&salsa: chips weren't crispy. Free but not a fan of stale chips. Red salsa tasted too much canned tomorrow, not enough lime nor cilantro. Brown one was the tastiest but too spicy for me. Green one lacked in flavor but wasn't too spicy. I see they tried but not well executed till the end. - Conqueror's Deduction - I see they tried, but far from the quality level from Frida in LA. Definitely not the best Mexican food that some Yelpers claim. They could be better but not good enough to make me come back again. It's more tailored to non Mexican clientele who don't know much about real tasty Mexican foods. I love the food at Frida so much, this was a huge disappointment to me. Where's a good Mexican food in SB?",3 star rating,Akiko I.

10/28/2020,"Granada Hills, CA",I've been here twice. The 1st time I had a burrito and it was decent. 2nd time I came here I wasn't too hungry and wanted an appetizer so I went with nachos. My gf went with enchiladas and we were both unhappy with our food. The chicken and everything layered on top of my nachos was pretty cold but the bottom layer was hot. Don't be fooled by the look of the food it's all presentation. The taste isn't anything too crazy to be amazed by. Food pricing is not worth.

We had to ask two additional times for the fourth entree, which then arrived 15 mins later. Two people in our party got the vegetarian burrito which had chunks of hard raw carrot. No one was pleased with their meals. Everything was over salted. All of this after spending $125 total for 4. TLDR: Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",1 star rating,Valerie P.

I only went here after reading the reviews of my fellow yelpers. You all did not let me down!The restaurant has you walk in, look at a menu and there are several hostesses ready to take your order and payment. We waited about 10 min for our to-go order. All staff was wearing masks and gloves. They were kind enough to accommodate my request for a chile verde burrito bowl since I follow a keto diet. (I didn't know about the side of rice being included but that's ok, I gave it to my son to eat. The chile verde was top notch. Better than even some of my local favorites in Fresno.

9/19/2020,"New York, NY","This was my favorite meal in Santa Barbara. I can't wait to come back. I got the agaves burrito and asada nachos after seeing how highly rated they were on Yelp.The Agaves Burrito was a wet burrito so I had to use my fork and knife to gracefully eat it. It was the star of my meal. It had a nice little kick to it that made it slightly spicy, but just the slightest. I don't do well with spicy so this was the perfect amount for me. The burrito came with a salad that I wasn't expecting! I don't normally love salads but this one came with some fruit and was super sweet and crunchy. The dish also came with your typical Mexican rice.The Asada Nachos were a perfect table splitter for the group. My friend preferred the nachos over her dish! The nachos were a little soft and they kept breaking in half for me, but I was able to make do. They provided a generous amount of asada and guacamole so I was a happy camper. Very large dish and it was layered well that I could eat all the flavors with one chip.I would come back and maybe try other dishes, but I wouldn't mind getting these same 2 dishes again!",5 star rating,Claire L.
7/25/2020,"Riverside, CA","This was our last stop from our trip up North. We searched for top rated restaurants in the area and Los Agaves was one of the top restaurants we found. I forgot I came here years ago with my mother when we visited the mission and we loved it then. The difference from then to now is the COVID-19 measures they made. We ate at the back of the restaurant beside the parking lot. When you ordered the employees were all masked and wore gloves. We ordered at the register with a plexus glass separating us. All standard. They also cleaned and disinfected the tables and chairs after each guests left. The food was really good and definitely hit the spot after several hours of driving. The mole enchiladas was my favorite but that's not a surprise since I do favor ordering that. The ceviche was delicious and had plenty of shrimp. Both tasted fresh and had plenty of flavored. We also ordered from the children menu and ordered the cheese quesadilla which my son loved. Overall, I am glad I came here and again.

Loved the Shrimp in the tacos - spicy and cooked properly. the service took a bit long so we were brought over some chips. They have an extensive salsa bar and multiple options for spicy and mild. It's a little pricier for Mexican food, but definitely worth a visit!.Since its not so far from me now I usually grab a taste there whenever I've got all day free and sometimes my friends already planned to go there in advance(The live in the area) and I just simply join them(Yeah they like it cuz I recommended them).",5 star rating,Tamara R.

Me and my friend ordered food and my other friends ordered right after us and they got their food 30 minutes later. Then my other friends ordered food and we where waiting around 30-40 more minutes. Very unfortunate for us because we where waiting for everyone to get their food to start eating so we ended up eating our food cold. The servers kept coming to ask if we have gotten all our food yet around 3 times. (We hadn't). To make it even worse, the girl who was cashier, shorted me $10 and tried to tell me she didn't. She ended up giving me the money but it was just a very unpleasant visit. The food would have been good if it wasn't cold from all the waiting.",1 star rating,Dulce R.

We had to ask for our drinks three times and the food arrived before napkins and silverware. If you don't want to eat as a party-together-this is the place.

We got the chicken sopes and agaves enchiladas with a small mango margarita. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The star of the show was hands down the agaves enchiladas. Big pieces of shrimp and fish were used to stuff the enchiladas and the enchilada sauce was so flavorful and creamy.

The plates are huge and definitely worth every buck! I ordered the plate of shrimp tacos and there was more than enough to fill me up. I'll definitely be stopping by again when I'm in the area.",5 star rating,Nicole T.
3/14/2021,"Oxnard, CA","This is a staple for us when the family is in Santa Barbara. They've opened others near us but none can match the flavor. I've talked to many others that have said the same without prompting.  This Los Agaves in particular, is well known and a must when in the area.   It is cafeteria style so it may seem inconvenient having to wait in line to order your food but it's definitely worth it. Food is consistently delicious but due to popularity they do run out of their best dishes.  I've been to this place about 20 times and blown away with the flavor 19 times. With COVID restrictions they only do takeout so find a nice park to sit for a picnic. Order ahead.",5 star rating,Goose D.
5/27/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","This isn't my first review for Los Agaves since they have several locations, but this location happens to be where it all started. I remember my first meal being the ""Carne Atzeca"". It was a delicious grilled NY steak, with a stuffed Anaheim pepper, grilled nopalito, chorizo, and a cute little tostada shell bowl filled with their unique beans. Definitely a different take on mexican food that couldn't be found elsewhere in town. The food, and presentation were on point and the amount of food was more than enough. Ever since then I've been a fan of Los Agaves but unfortunately, I don't come here quite as often due to their increased prices. Now it's a treat to come here whenever I have extra money to splurge.I will say that the Family meals they have offered for take-out during COVID19 are definitely worth the price! Ranging from $37 - $45; not only is the food served fresh, and hot, but the portion serving is more than generous! They also provide a nice range of their delicious salsas with tortilla chips. So, kudos to them for putting this together during hard times. You can find their temporary menu at the following link: los-agaves.com/temp-menu  OH! And let's not forget you can also order beer or margaritas to go during their daily happy hour (11am - 5pm). They have some great margarita flavors to choose from such as Jamaica, mango pineapple, Tamarindo con Chile, blood orange, and their house margarita. The only catch is you must order food if you're planning to take it to go. I went in to pick up my food for take-out last week and they appeared to be open for dining. I'm sure the capacity will be cut in half unlike Pre-COVID where it was always jam packed with people inside, and lines forming outside the door. As of right now all restaurants in town are open for inside dining with limited seating, and new guidelines. Be sure to take your mask regardless! Overall, I love supporting our local restaurants when I can, but it's been tough during this quarantine. I greatly appreciate the cleanliness, and extra precautions all of our restaurants have taken to safely handle, prepare, and serve us.",4 star rating,Angela R.

3/29/2021,"Irvine, CA","My family and I are always looking for authentic Mexican Cuisine and by far this place has it all! We had the Jalisco Margarita, which was just like a Cantarito or Paloma from Jalisco! It was served with 7 Leguas, IYKYK! Service was very pleasing and cleanliness was spot on!

12/6/2020,"Durham, NC","Being in quarantine allows my mind to wander and thus I'm reminded of all the delicious food I've had in my life and Los Agaves has been on my heart and mind all week. I came here roughly 4 years ago on the whim and had one of the best meals of my life here: the seafood molcajete. It's presented in what looks like a clay pot. The pot was piping hot and boasted all sorts of seafood and vegetables. Words can't describe how hearty and delicious it was. I was so smitten by this dish that I would easily fly to Santa Barbara just to have the seafood molcajete again. Endless drools. If you make it to this place, order it! You won't be disappointed!",5 star rating,Nancy N.
5/27/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","This is one of my must-visit places when I'm in the Santa Barbara area!Right now seating is limited and with the current situation they do have part of their dining room available, but only about 5-6 tables that can only handle parties of about 4 people. I've gotten take out from Los Agaves many times before and their attention to quality is so good that the experience is equally as good whether its take out or dine in!I usually order: AGAVES BURRITO- The BEST seafood burrito I have had anywhere!- The burrito is filled with shrimp and fish, lettuce, rice, beans, etc.- The real winner is the sauce that comes with the burrito SO GOOD- If it's your first time here and you like seafood this is definitely a must try!2 ITEM COMBO - CHICKEN ENCHILADA & BEEF CRISPY TACO - The combos come with a big cup of beans and a little pyramid of rice!- I usually order the enchilada and crispy taco for a little variety!- The meat is always super tender and flavorful - This plate gives you a little taste of everything if you can't decide on just one thingSTEAK NACHOS- This makes a great appetizer or if you're really really hungry, it could be an entree too!- This pile of nachos is huge! I have never once finished it on my own - It comes with all your normal nacho toppings (beans, cheese, guacamole, salsa, etc.)- The steak is sooooo good!

7/7/2020,"Washington, DC","One of my top 3 favorite restaurants in the SB area! Although the food is slightly more expensive than most Mexican restaurants I've been to, it's 10000% worth. I got the agaves burrito which was ~$16 after tax I think, and it was massive. The orange sauce on top is TO DIE FOR, and overall the plate was very filling because they also gave a side of salad and rice. This burrito is filled with seafood (shrimp and fish), lettuce, rice, beans, sauce, etc. I loved dipping tortilla chips in the orange sauce too!!Service was wonderful! Food came out really fast and when one of my friends got the wrong meat for her enchilada, they came out with a new enchilada in like 1 minute. There's a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant, and there's a door in the back you can get into the store from.",5 star rating,Iris F.
6/16/2020,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA","This is the real deal.  I ordered queso fundido and it was everything I wanted and more.  My husband ordered something that I can't remember the name of ‍ - taco porfieria?? It was a chicken taco with a mole and it was very tasty.  I also ordered a beef crispy taco with rice and pinto beans.  They provided several salsas including a delicious roasted salsa that I couldn't get enough of.The queso fundido came with 3 fresh tortillas and was chock full of chorizo and pasilla peppers.  Wow, it was excellent!  I'm not a huge fan of spice and I was delighted that this had a nice amount of heat without being overpowering.  I haven't had queso fundido this delicious since grad school in Mexico City, it really took me back down memory lane!The staff were friendly, they were also very conscientious about cleaning and I saw that tables and chairs were sanitized after each guest left.I am very sad that I don't live next door to Los Agaves.  I'll be back in a heartbeat next time I'm anywhere near Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Kristen M.

11/21/2020,"San Mateo, CA","We stopped in for an earlier dinner this evening. This restaurant was both recommended by friends and highly rated on yelp which made it an obvious choice. Or so we thought. Overall, our resounding impression was 'meh'. Average at best. Especially at a relatively higher price point for an area with so much Mexican food available. The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio with plentiful seating and spacing between tables for distancing. The employees all diligently wore masks and gloves which was reassuring.We ordered the steak burrito mojado and the shrimp fajitas (about $13 and $20 respectively). We were given a number and told to pick our own table. Unfortunately, we had to ask for water three times since we weren't allowed to serve ourselves and the staff seemed to keep forgetting...The steak burrito was decently sized and doused with a red sauce plated alongside orange rice, guacamole and sour cream. The rice was tasty and the steak well cooked, but overall nothing special. I don't eat wet burritos very often so it could very well have been normal, but the red sauce was reminiscent of a marinara/tomato/Ragu type sauce doused over the burrito. Not so great. While the steak was well cooked, I felt the seasoning was more salt than anything. Difficult to enjoy the saltiness especially with no water...As for the shrimp fajitas, decently large shrimp on a bed of mostly bell peppers. The shrimp seemed well cooked but, alas, the taste was on the fishier side that overpowered the dish. Was hoping for better, but unfortunately Los Agaves was a miss. Probably wouldn't return unless we had to.",3 star rating,Adam S.

2/12/2021,"Hendersonville, NC","Mexican can taste all the same after a while especially on the east coast, but this place plays it C well and has great flavors, solid portions, and just damn good. Only complaint is that I love fresh in house chips which in don't think is a big ask. Unfortunately these are not but then again so far my dining experience in SB has not revealed home made chips with the exception of the ""kaneoula fish market"" which actually makes fresh chips.  There are two locations. Both pretty casual which is expected. Both have very friendly staff. Kudos to them for that.",5 star rating,Brent K.

9/24/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I live pretty close to Los Agaves so I've gone here quite often and it is good, overhyped a little, but good. My first order was the Chicken Chimichanga and I will say it wasn't a great choice for me. The chicken was really dry and I was a little turned off by that meal, so much that I couldn't finish it. However, I've gone back because I've heard so many good things and had to give it a second try. The second time ordering was a...success! This time I got the steak nachos and it was a loaded and large portion that I was happily struggling to eat. That $11 nachos were looking more like a $16 plate with the size! I'm a hard nacho critic, so I say this with love, it was pretty good! It wasn't stellar and I wouldn't give that dish five stars because there wasn't enough cheese to get me through the billion perfectly salted chips, but the flavor and portions were good for the price. Now on to my next dish, which has earned this rating four stars...The quesadillas and tacos are amazing! I ordered the quesadillas for my mom and that's all she wanted for the rest of her visit to SB. Take-out will never be as good as eating at a restaurant so the quality can suffer, but ultimately this place is worth getting some quality Mexican food.",4 star rating,Liana C.

There was a ton of shredded unmelted cheese inside the burrito, and not a ton of fish or shrimp. We got it to-go due to covid. Maybe the ambiance would have helped bump it up a notch, but the food alone was not memorable. If you come, don't expect anything authentic!",3 star rating,Jessalyn C.
11/1/2020,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",I was expecting a hole in the wall Mexican joint but Los Agaves is pretty fancy. They have a great back outdoor patio seating and the food is really good. I got the Agaves burrito which is a fish and shrimp burrito which comes with a side of rice and a salad. The margaritas are also great and come with a nice rim of salt. The food is a little pricey and isn't your regular late night Mexican spot to cure the drunchies but instead a classy restaurant serving high quality food.,5 star rating,Scott S.
9/7/2020,"San Francisco, CA","I was skeptical when learning about this place, but followed yelp reviews and friends' recommendations and got the Agaves Enchiladas. I don't normally love enchiladas, but these don't taste like your typical enchiladas. It's not smothered in cheese, but rather a chipotle sauce that was creamy and had a slight kick. It was delicious. It's filled shrimp and fish, which is a nice welcomed change as well. The shrimp was a bit dry, but the fish was perfect. I wish I could have the entire enchilada filled with fish. Comes with rice and some salad. I'd been eyeing the mole enchilada too because I'm a big mole fan, and luckily they were able to let me get a side of mole so I could try it. Honestly though, I think this mole sauce was too sweet / chocolatey for my liking. I'm glad I didn't order an entire enchilada smothered in it.  The mole enchilada comes with rice and beans instead of salad, fyi. It's covid times and sweltering hot outside, so appreciate that the service was really quick and that they provided ice cold water.  Horchata was also especially refreshing. Also, the outdoor dining patio was shaded with umbrellas and tables were actually spaced far enough apart that I felt comfortable eating there. It was around 1PM (Labor Day Sunday) when we finished eating, and the line to order was still long, and still people waiting for a table. Would definitely come back again.",5 star rating,Cynthia X.

By the time we ordered, they had a table ready for us and the food arrived pretty quickly after that. The salsa bar is a must! I tried a few and really couldn't pick a favorite since they were all loaded with flavor and the perfect spice. I was able to find a low carb/keto friendly option with ease here and it wasn't the normal fajitas. I ordered the shrimp and cheese stuffed poblanos with a side cesar salad and roasted veggies. Everything tasted great, the filling was loaded with tender shrimp and tons of cheese.The portion was huge!

ParkingThere's decent sized parking on the opposite side of the street.Food & ServiceBeing vegetarians, we honestly weren't impressed with the quality of the burrito bowl and nachos. What made it worse was the fact that I discovered a plastic piece in my nachos. Upon bringing it to the attention of the servers, I was pretty appalled at the lack of seriousness and casual attitude, most of which can be attributed to lack of training or experience. I was later provided with a refund for my dish and a smiling apology for the inconvenience which probably didn't change the way I felt about my evening.",2 star rating,Sandeep R.

That's how much it didn't hold up for take out. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars because the ceviche had good flavor and also the tacos al pastor. I might come back again if they open up for dine in.

Would recommend 10/10 and coming back again,5 star rating,Aisha A.
12/29/2019,"EMIGRATN CYN, UT","Food is definitely a 5/5. Delicious! The queso is melty and creamy, the tacos have a perfect combo of savory meat and crunch. I got a smothered burrito with steak. The food was beautifully presented and everything was delicious. Some things to consider when going there: It was very crowded when we went on a Saturday afternoon and it was a bummer that there was only one bathroom. Some outdoor seating would also be nice! That being said, we love this place and will definitely come back!",5 star rating,Anna H.
9/17/2019,"San Diego, CA","We went to Los Agaves after waking up in Santa Barbara. It's a fast-casual restaurant, so you'll pay at the counter and then someone brings you your order. I really wanted to try the molcate, so I got the sea and earth one. My hubby decided to get the huarache and quesadillas de flore de calabaza.When we picked out a table to sit at, we were given complimentary chips and salsa along with our drinks. I got the horchata and he chose the tamarind soda. The chips were fresh and I liked the salsa that went with it. When my molcajete arrived, it looked impressive. There was a variety of seafood and meats, so it was pretty filling. The stew was very flavorful and you also get a few warm tortillas with this dish. One of my friends tried this after my recommendation and loved it as well.",4 star rating,Dung N.

10/29/2020,"Long Beach, CA",This place is absolutely delicious!!! I came on a Saturday (my birthday) and the service was good. I feel like it the decorations we lovely and very traditional Spanish style. I got my food about 10 minutes after ordering and it got pretty busy after we ordered.

11/3/2019,"Las Vegas, NV",Solid Mexican food in a great venue.  This place deserves the five stars.  You order at the counter and hunt for a place to sit.  They bring chips and salsa to your table that you can make a meal of because they are so tasty.  The food arrived hot and fairly quickly.   We all enjoyed our meals and dispatched them fairly quickly.  The food was flavorful and authentic.  Be aware this place is popular and crowded at peak times.  There can we a long line and a wait to find a table but it is well worth it. Los Agaves is a gem.  Go here!,5 star rating,Brian S.
9/11/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Pro-Tip: Eat the Molcajetes as a stew and forget about the tortillas. They don't really add anything of significance to the Molcajetes experience.This would have been a four stars, but their yelp prices are vastly different than what I paid for. I paid over 20 dollars for their legendary Molcajetes.Over 20 dollars is way too much. Even with steak.But the Molcajetes was pretty good. It's supposed to be a spicy marinated tomato based stew. However, it really wasn't that spicy, rather  hot. I needed to add jalapeños to give it more heat.They have a pretty big salsa bar, and everything is homemade including their tortillas. I wasn't sure what to do with the homemade tortillas to be honest. You can put the chorizo or whatever you ordered (steak, chicken, shrimp) in it, but to me, it makes it messy, and the tortillas don't really serve a purpose.For Twenty dollars, I was expecting more meat. Instead, it was mostly broth based. If you are to make a sandwich from the tortillas, probably best add in more to justify the twenty dollar price tag.",3 star rating,Daniel B.

My husband got the lamb and barbacoa tacos which were incredibly savory albeit a little oily. I got the fish tacos and shrimp tacos which had a great charred taste from being grilled.

4/29/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","There was a time when I thought this was some of the best food in all of Santa Barbara. However, recently, I ordered food to go. When I arrived, my food was ready, but the the cashier refused to check all of the bags. He made me wait 40 minutes. On my fourth time asking him to check the names on all of the bags, he did. Naturally, he found my food, which was cold. He surreptitiously brought it into the kitchen, then brought it back out and pretended that it had just been cooked. I watched him do it. I asked to speak to a manager. He apologized, but was quick to usher me out of the restaurant before anyone else heard. To top things off, I got food poisoning from the shrimp quesadilla.",1 star rating,George B.

1/4/2021,"Playa del Rey, CA",Came here two days in the row . The second day I drove over and a half just to get some more of their infamous black salsa . I ordered one crunchy chicken taco one crunchy beef taco one shrimp taco one chimichanga with beef and chicken and enchilada and the house margarita the guava margarita the blood orange margarita and the mango margarita . All of the margaritas were decent however my absolute favorite was the house. The classic Jalisco was refreshing as well as the perfect balance between sweet and tart. Overall the house margarita was a little bit more complex in taste then the other offerings ironically. The shrimp taco with the black salsa will change your life. Honestly the black salsa on anything makes it 20 million times better however my favorite food items are the crunchy chicken taco as well as the shrimp taco with the black salsa. I wish they sold that black salsa by the gallon individually. It's honestly one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth .,5 star rating,Aerin A.
3/6/2021,"Irvine, CA",Food really isn't impressive at all. Definitely not 4.5 stars.  Salsa provided was pretty bad.  I could not eat it.  2 stars from me is mostly for service.  Makes me want to stay away from Mexican/Southwestern restaurants in SB.,2 star rating,James P.

3/13/2020,"Shelter Island, NY","I will be sure to take pictures next time I'm in...trouble is the food is so amazing I always dive right in and forget to  take pics. The prices are certainly higher than an average Mexican joint, but make no mistake, you will quickly forget what the bill was when you taste the food. Honestly the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Order from the counter, take a number, and wait for your food to be delivered to the table while you snack on complementary chips and salsa. Speaking of salsa, their salsa bar is LEGIT. 8-10 verities of salsa ranging in spiciness. Unlike many salsa bars they let you take as much as you want which is music to my condiment loving tastebuds. I've had the land and sea mocajete, loaded with shrimp, fish, chicken & steak. It was literally still boiling by the time out meal was over. Their pinto beans come as a side to most dishes and are served in an adorable tortilla cup. They are adequately staffed so service is quick and food arrives 10-15 minutes after ordering, sometimes way sooner. Don't miss this spot, it's especially perfect if you need a bite before a event at the SB Bowl (right down the street)!",5 star rating,Emily N.
7/25/2020,"Glendale, CA","I ordered COVID era take out this last week. Looking around: this unit is very similar than the unit in which i usually eat on De La Vina. They had their COVID regulations in place with no service inside except for take out orders. They offered waiter service outside where the tables were appropriately spaced.The details seemed all in place for a nice outdoor dining experience but one tempered with the rules of doing restaurant business in this very difficult year, 2020.Also: plan your visit here carefully because there is an inordinate amount of road work and construction in what used to be a sleepy eastside area of SB particularly around lunch time.In any event i ordered:2 Chile Relleno Burritos with rice and guacamole.An order of Mole enchiladas(we received a big bag of freshly fried chips and a trio of their super good salsas.)One thing was a bit off-putting: El Precio total!  are we really at the point in our food restaurant history where 2 burritos and a plate of enchies cost 50 bucks??Now the food:The Chiles Rellenos are famous here and rightfully so. The Chiles used are not out of a can and i assume roasted or grilled and stuffed here and it is plenty big for 2. Biting into it it burst with cheesy goodness as well as the taste of a savory grilled Pasilla(?) chile. this burrito was mostly chile and cheese with a little rice and beans. Good Stuff.The Mole here is one of my favorites but this order of enchiladas was not up to par with too many bits of overcooked chicken almost ruining the experience. But the super primo Mole sauce here is one of the best i have ever eaten anywhere including in Oaxaca, Mexico (where probably this recipe originated...just a guess). The Mole is obviously built with layers of garlic, onions, several types of chiles, chocolate, etc. their Mole person really knows what she is doing. I bow down to her/him! (in reality i would bet that the Moleria is a woman...)Service was quick and pleasant though it is a little odd to see the insides of the restaurant bare: actually set up for a DISCO! experience.Very Good food and service today at a Los Agaves unit that i visited for the first time.Cheers!",4 star rating,Michael A.
7/26/2020,"Redondo Beach, CA",If you are in Santa Barbara and you like Mexican food... Yes you need to try this place. OMG I could barely get up after my meal but it was worth every calorie. My husband thought I over ordered -- which I typically do-- but we left behind empty plates. The guacamole was refreshing and delicious... the steak on my nachos was perfect and both my kids devoured their chicken quesadilla and asked for more. I really liked the guava margarita which was not too sweet but I was not impressed with the mango margarita which was way too sweet and had a kick to it. With Covid you order at the register and they have ample outside seating behind the restaurant. It was very clean and I watched them sterilize each table and chairs between guests. They even had a machine that sterilized the credit card after you pay for your food. Everyone in masks and lots of distance between tables. I felt very comfortable eating here. Highly recommend!,5 star rating,Alla L.
7/26/2019,"Phoenix, AZ","Personally, I think the hype for Los Agaves is a bit too high. But with so many Yelp reviews and long lines, I insisted that my girlfriend and I give them a try during our recent trip to Santa Barbara.My first question is: What happens to the people that dine-in and have no place to sit? Considering my girlfriend and I barely found a seat, I'm guessing the crowds that piled in after us were forced to take all of their food to go?Anyway, Los Agaves offers up Mexican food. A lot of Mexican food. The menu attempts to cover a lot of ground - probably too much, in fact. The food is priced as more of a mid-tier sit-down restaurant, but done using an order at the counter approach.Los Agaves isn't bad by any means. My rajas con queso and carne asada tacos were both decent - with the asada being far, far better than what I experienced the previous day at Lilly's Tacos. My gringa al pastor, which is a greasy, cheesy quesadilla wasn't too bad, but by no means the best version I've ever tried. My girlfriend's Enchiladas Guadalajara were fine, but once again, weren't quite anything memorable in comparison to some of her favorites.Beans and rice were both on-point, while guacamole was also what you'd expect.Maybe for Santa Barbara's limited options, Agaves is a gold-mine. But if you're well acquainted with good Mexican food outside of the area, you'll realize that Agaves isn't really anything special. In other words, there's nothing here that feels exclusive.In the end, it's worth a visit, but probably not a place I'd ever return to in the future. But for tourists and locals, it's easily a solid choice.",3 star rating,Fabby C.

Last time we irdered it was six tacos all beautifully laid out, to hell with this crap in a bag. No one ate it.Then we called them and TWICE called me a liar!!saying "" We dont deliver"" I have the damn bag in my hand! Oh, once they were caught then they scrambled to change their story.

9/5/2019,"Santa Clara, CA","MY FAVORITE MEXICAN RESTAURANT OF ALL TIME! I don't know why I haven't written a review about this place yet. I've been coming to eat here with my family since 2008. Every time we have guests visiting, we bring them here!You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. For starters, the horchata is the best I've ever had and is housemade. Yes! You get free chips and salsa with your order. My favorite item on the menu are the mole enchiladas, but I usually get them with shredded chicken. I also love their chile relleno. The rice which comes with most orders is also the best mexican rice I, or literally anyone else who has been there has ever had! And the beans are perfect and come in a little tortilla cup. Last time I came here, I took my boyfriend to get ceviche for the first time in his life. It was the green ceviche on the specials menu. We both loved it! Oh yeah, did I mention that service is amazing too. You really feel like you're in Mexico when you step in because of how hospitable, kind, and accommodating everyone else. Se hablan español por aqui y they do an immaculate job of getting everyone waiting in line a table to sit at, even if every table is initially full. I don't know how they do it, en serio, but they do the damn thing! So don't be intimidated by the line or the the unfamiliarity of the dishes if you've never had authentic Mexico food before. There is so much more to it than tacos and quesadillas, mis gringos, I promise! ;)",5 star rating,Isabella F.

However this was one of the best Mexican food I have had. And needless to say, I would drive up from orange county to come here every weekend if I could. Their tacos, burritos, the enchiladas, and pretty much everything we had gotten was absolutely amazing. To really highlight what I'm trying to say, my dad eats small portions, but he got a second order of enchiladas and down them! They are that good. Their service is pretty phenomenal as well.

I was a little skeptical at first since I was tipping before knowing how service will be, but I was very happy with service + the food!My boyfriend got the Agaves burrito. It was delicious! The filing inside the burrito + the sauce on top was very refreshing. I got the mole enchiladas, and this did not disappoint either. Both dishes came with rice on the side and were very filling; we had to take half of the dishes to-go.Service was great! Staff was very friendly.

8/26/2020,"Anaheim, CA","From Orange county and I decided to take a trip for a late lunch. I ordered the mole enchiladas and the halibut tacos both were amazing I was more impressed with the mole enchiladas because I haven't had mole on enchiladas like ever. The only downside to the fish tacos was the slaw that they add to the tacos kind of over does it for me. I know it's the type of style when they flood your corn tortilla with a lot of the mango slot to give it a good contrast to the halibut, But I actually enjoyed the holiday just without that slaw. And the chips and salsa were complementary and the salsa was very good definitely made in house and on the spicier side. During COVID 19 I wasn't sure what to expect but overall I was extremely impressed with their staff attentiveness and the way I was able to come in order and sit immediately. This was on a Sunday afternoon as well. Overall five stars and I wouldn't mind making the trip to enjoy that again.",5 star rating,Dominic E.

8/21/2019,"Long Beach, CA","My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch when visiting Santa Barbara, and we're so glad that we did! We found the place based on the high rating and number of reviews on Yelp. Once again, Yelp didn't disappoint!First of all - we came around 3 pm, and there was a short line to order at the counter. The cashier was super helpful and gave us great recommendations. After ordering, you seat yourself. Most tables were full, so I can imagine that it gets pretty crazy during the lunchtime rush!Once seated, they give you a basket of tortilla chips and there is a self-serve salsa bar by the cashier. The avocado crema was my personal favorite - creamy and super fresh!I ordered the molcajete with steak and absolutely LOVED it... It came out sizzling hot and smelled so great! I wasn't really sure how to eat it - they provided me with some corn tortillas but I actually preferred drinking it as a stew and dipping chips in it (with avocado crema on top yummmmm). It was a little spicy and smoky, but just the right amount. The stew looked like a lot of sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat that was hiding under the surface! And all super tender!We also got the ceviche as a starter, and my husband got the chicken nachos as an entree. Both were great, but be careful - the portions are all huge! We thought the ceviche would be a smaller portion, but it was as big as (or maybe even bigger than) a full entree portion. Also the nachos were a little redundant since we already had lots of chips & salsa.All in all, I would definitely come back here and order the molcajete again. And next time with an horchata ;)",5 star rating,Julie S.

Appreciated all the vegetarian meals they offered since my kids hardly eat meat. My husband's beef and lamb barbacoa tacos were also very good. They gave a big bowl of barbacoa juice on the side, which honestly I could slurp right up if it wasn't for the after effects of heartburn. Great service during the pandemic too.

I felt like the majority of the dish was just sauce and I would not have been full if I didn't try some of the agave burrito! They also provide free chips and a salsa bar with plenty of options! The sauces were delicious as well! Parking was pretty easy to fine and service was quick. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever around the area.",5 star rating,Denise J.
1/19/2020,"Manhattan, NY","This place gets amazing reviews for a reason. We went New Year's Day and man was it a great way to kick off a new decade. This place def gets packed, we were there right when it opened and there was already tons of people walking in behind us. Can't image what it's like later on the day!! Alright the place.... it's huge!!! There are two rooms of seating which is great. They give you free chips (which is a treat when you're coming from nyc where this rarely happens) which are delish. Their salsas are fresh and on point. Loved the variety in options especially for someone like me who doesn't like super spicy things. Dish wise we got the enchiladas with shredded chicken and their famous green sauce. So yummy! We also got two pork tacos that were huge and soooooo good. I think honestly you can't go wrong here. Everything is made so quick and the staff were chill and friendly. Goooooooooo you won't regret it!!!",5 star rating,Shelley K.

The food was fresh, delicious and nutritious!  You can never go wrong with Seafood tacos. You are in Santa Barbara - a paradise by the sea! They give you a starter of chips and 3 different sauces. LOVED that!!Giving customers options of mild, medium to hot is the way to go. I would have given 5 stars but there was a delay in getting my drink, I needed to wash down the heat. The server was apologetic  when he explained the drink order was missed in the shuffle. Not his fault,  Maybe it was the person at the bar making the  drinks. LOL!  Overall, all was forgiven- I walked out of there feeling happy and full. BTW, easily found curbside parking and there was plenty of outdoor seating at the back.",4 star rating,Anna C.

6/25/2019,"Sunnyvale, CA","Such a great place for amazing Mexican food! After seeing over 3000 reviews for this place, we decided to try it for dinner. It was amazing with some really great options. When you enter the place, you place the order first and then go look for a table. There was a pretty long queue to order but they were pretty quick in taking orders. We got ourselves a Garden Burrito, Poblano Tacos and Nachos. The guy who took our order suggested the Vegetarian taco and it was AMAZING! The food was delish, especially the Tacos for Vegetarians! They were well made and came with a bowl of SUPER AWESOME black beans. The Garden burrito was great too, but the nachos was not as good as the other two. I would skip the nachos next time around. They serve chips with the order and have a bar of salsas and add-ins like cilantro, lime, pico and jalapeños. The avocado sauce and medium salsa were our favorites from the bar. Next time that we are in Santa Barbara; definitely going back to this place :)",5 star rating,Smruti A.

There is outdoor dining and a few places indoors, but the space is so big and open doesn't feel like a suffy indoor area. You order at the counter right now (COVID) and they bring you your food, drinks, etc. Good ambiance, very friendly and attentive staff and the food was SO GOOD. I got the chicken chimichanga and luckily I had leftovers because I wanted another one the next day. The Margaritas are HUGE too. Would definitely recommend and go back here on our next trip.",5 star rating,Rebecca O.

10/20/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","I don't live in or near Santa Barbara, so this is only my 2nd time going, but both times it's been GREAT. The service is great. You go up and order at the counter, but while you wait at your table, you get complimentary tortilla chips that are warm and deliciousssss. The different sauces and salsas in the back are all really good and really good with the chips! There was some delay in my order coming out, but the staff were all very attentive without me having to flag them down. They went to the back to check on the order and were very good at letting me know they haven't forgotten about me or my order. I was honestly pleasantly surprised.My favorite dish was the tacos del mar. I got the combination of the fish and shrimp, but next time I visit, I'm definitely getting just the shrimp! It was really hot and sooooo goooood! The fish was good too, but I loved the shrimp way more. The rice was also really good and the salad. I would also recommend getting their guacamole. I wasn't able to order that last night, but my sister had some guac come out with her dish (wet burrito) and it was perfect with the chips and our main dishes! Also, portions are quite big! There's a parking lot in the back, but it's really small so it may be rare for a spot to open up... but I've had no problems finding street parking! Just be sure to check the signs, especially in the residential areas, just in case.",5 star rating,Jane K.

1/5/2019,"Brea, CA",We were driving through and wanted some authentic Mexican food at the same time wanted a variety and a place to sit our tired butts down. I got the gringa al pastor burritos but when it arrived it was already cut up to bite size critters which was awesome. The presentation was good and the rich flavor of al pastor and pineapple mixed together made an awesome burrito. The crispy taco was a bit on the greasy side but the chicken itself was a bit of a downer as it was dry and the only way to save it was to drench it in pico de gallo. As for the enchiladas they too sucked as the chicken were overly dry but since they were covered in sauces it was manageable. Presentation was good all around. The place is clean and had many servers to help refill your tortillas. I also liked that the sauce cups were larger than most that you didn't have to frequently go back to refill them.,4 star rating,Tim E.
5/2/2019,"San Francisco, CA",I was just passing by Santa Barbara for lunch and decided to stop at Los Agaves. It's apparently the most viewed restaurant in the area on Yelp. I got the garden burrito and it was STUFFED. It has pinto beans and lots of grilled peppers and zucchini inside. The pinto beans was like a sauce for the filling. Very flavorful and an amazing vegetarian option. It's definitely very popular lunch place because there's was a line to order food just as I was leaving the place. They have complimentary chips and a salsa bar. Highly recommend coming here if you haven't already!,5 star rating,Janice J.
7/8/2020,"San Francisco, CA","Our take out order was so delicious! Tamarindo con Chile Margaritas were perfection. The flavors of the tamarind and Chile were unique and so, so good. The Agaves seafood burrito is covered with a drool-worthy chipotle sauce. This is one that you just have to close your eyes and savor -- it's that tasty. The chicken mole enchiladas were topped with homemade mole sauce. Delicious, yummy, mole sauce :)Portions were hearty, so my friend and I essentially had two nights worth of dinners from one meal. I will most definitely return, and I absolutely recommend this place!",5 star rating,Jeanie S.
12/29/2018,"Rowland Heights, CA","Was recommended to come here as this was a ""must eat"" when you're in Santa Barbara and it didn't disappoint. Definitely lived up to the hype for me! Although it may at first seem a little pricey, but the portions and flavor/quality of the food live up to their price. I came around 5:30pm on a Friday and had to wait in line for about 25 minutes (we were at the door). Definitely come in earlier than later, the line was around the building as we left!This is not a traditional sit-down restaurant, instead you order and pay first and then either self-seat your party with a number or a staff member can help you find/organize table. I feel like the line only went slow because people did not know what to order when they got to the register. There are plenty of menus, so use the time in line to figure out what you will be eating.SERVICE: There are a ton of people there and they are really good at multitasking. Food also came out very efficiently too, which I always appreciate.PARKING: Parking on the street or in the residential area for free. TORTILLA CHIPS: Free tortilla chips whoo! From what I know, they're unlimited but one was enough for my boyfriend and I. BURRITO MOJADO: You have the option to choose between steak ($12.50) and chicken ($11.95). I got the STEAK and it was so good! This was a wet burrito that came with plenty of grilled steak, pinto beans, and monterey jack cheese with queso fresco and salsa roja on top. This was so good!!! It also came with rice, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, and pico de gallo on the side. I definitely could not finished this by myself and shared it with my boyfriend. Would hands down get this again! TACOS DEL MAR: You get 2 tacos and have the option to choose both shrimp ($14.50), both pescado ($13.50), or 1 of each ($13.95). I got the COMBO and definitely liked the SHRIMP better than the PESCADO. There were 3 shrimp in the taco and they were all very flavorful! The pescado one was just average to me, nothing stood out about it. The corn tortillas did fall apart easily, which made it difficult to share...prepare for a little bit of a messy meal! This also comes with a side of rice and house salad (surprisingly liked their sweet dressing with sour mango bits on salad) which I enjoyed both of. If I were to get this again, I would get just shrimp. SAUCES: They offer a self-serve sauce bar. Here's what I tried.-SALSA CHIPS (Mild): This was more tomato-y and was great for the chips!-SALSA TOMATILLO (Medium): I enjoyed this as well, but have a preference for red sauce over green. So I would choose chipotle over this one. -SALSA CHIPOTLE (Medium): This was my favorite sauce to use and the kick was perfect! Maybe teetering on too much, but this was my favorite.-PICO DE GALLO: Great!!-SALSA AGUAMENTE (Medium): This was more of a mild spicy if anything and more of an avocado salsa. Liked it too!Definitely want to come back in the future! We saw someone's order of al pastor tacos that were LOADED and want to order that next time! We also kind of wanted to try the molcajetes, but figured that was difficult to share between just 2 people.",5 star rating,Tiffany L.
12/31/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I made it up to this joint during the summer. I remember seeing this place on a lot of must-eats in CA. So of course when I made my way to Santa Barbara I had to stop by.I came by for lunch on a Saturday and the joint was PACKED OUT!!!!So the way it works is as follows:You wait in line, while in line you should look at the menu instead of like me wait til I get to the counter (lol).Once you're at the counter you gotta put in your order AND pay. Then go ahead and find ya seat and the most agonizing part is waiting for the food....I actually look for the opportunity to come back and try a better option.I ordered what I thought would be the BEST EVER BURRITO!!! That isn't the name of what I ordered, just my expectation....I ordered the Agaves Burrito....The burrito was straight up MASSIVE!!!I ordered with something about lit just didn't add up well. The fish and shrimp plus the chipotle sauce just messed it up! I think I would order without the chipotle sauce. On the other hand My friend ordered the Enchiladas GDL!!He enjoyed them so much! They also had this dish with a HUGE PORTION!!He let me try and I was def a fan of them.See ya next time Los Agaves :)",3 star rating,Nik E.

2/12/2019,"Monterey Park, CA","Hands down one of my favorite places to eat at in the Santa Barbara area! The prices are about average for the area, but Los Agaves ups its bang-for-the-buck ratio by giving you pretty generous portions. I've never left Los Agaves with extra room in my stomach.Their Burrito Mojado (wet burrito) is highly recommended. The sauce that's poured over the burrito not only makes it more flavorful, but reduces that heavy feeling you get from wolfing down a burrito. I also appreciate the guac and rice that's included with the order. The chicken nachos are super delicious. The portion size and the nature of nachos make this order great for sharing amongst a couple of people. There's a lot of flavor coming from the guac and sauces, and even the chicken is flavored well. If you're looking for a visual feast to go with your uh, feast, the Beef Molcajetes is a nice switch-up from the standard Mexican cuisine food. It comes in a stone mortar, complete with sauce, nopales (cactus pads), avocado, cheese, and your choice of meat. It's served with tortilla, and while it's visually impressive, it's not quite as filling as the other items, in my opinion. In addition to its delicious food, dining in also gives you the luxury of unlimited chips and salsa! There's a complete salsa bar with onions, cilantro, a countless variety of sauces, and more. My personal hack: in a small water cup, mix cilantro, pico de gallo, onions, and the green guac-colored sauce. Add a dash of lime juice, and mix it all together. It's my favorite sauce combination to pair with their chips!",5 star rating,Vincent L.
3/27/2021,"Fontana, CA","I was really looking forward to coming to this place while on vacation with my family but sadly I was extremely disappointed. 1st the location is not too good. Not much parking and lots of transients around the area 2nd and most importantly the food is just not good. It is also not cheap which made me even more upset. My son ordered the mole enchiladas. He loves mole so we thought this was a good choice for him. When the tried his enchiladas he spat them out. He said all he could taste was cinnamon. He ended up only eating the rice and beans. I ordered a wet burrito with steak. The cheese inside was cold, the burrito itself had no flavor. It was so bland and I wondered how even the red sauce it was smothered in was so flavorless. I am truly surprised how this place has such high reviews. Then again both of my parents are from Mexico so maybe I expect more from Mexican restaurants. But all I wanted was some flavor. Oh well now we know which Mexican restaurant to avoid when in Santa Barbara.",1 star rating,Darlene R.

In fact, it was the best I've ever had -- AGAIN.  Plus you get access to the BEST salsas on Earth.  No BS -- the BEST.  Roasted salsas, freshest Pico de Gallo, avocado cream, tomatillo, and a mild blended salsa.  The staff is AMAZING, courteous and very helpful I wish there was a Los Agaves in SLO or Santa Maria.",5 star rating,James M.

11/27/2018,"Carson, CA","During my short Santa Barbara getaway, the bf and I decided we wanted some good quality Mexican food! Originally, we wanted to eat at La-Superica but didn't want to wait 30+ min for food. We found Los Agaves on yelp and decided to give it a try based on their stellar reviews! Glad we did! Food was amazing! Not a typical sit-down restaurant. You order and pay for your food at the counter, find a seat, and wait for your food to be served. They also have an array of sauces at their sauce bar - ranging from mild to spicy and provide unlimited baskets of homemade chips to your table. YUM. I ordered the Enchiladas Guadalajara - Two enchiladas with shredded chicken or beef topped with our homemade salsa verde or salsa roja, melted Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream. SO DELICIOUS. Huge portions too! Flavorful but not overpowering. It came with a mango creamy side salad that I enjoyed. Ate it the next day as left overs and it was just as good! The bf ordered the Carne Asada Fajitas that was also delicious. The steak was tender and full of flavor. Definitely a go to spot when visiting Santa Barbara!",4 star rating,Jesse L.
8/11/2019,"San Gabriel, CA","During our trip to Santa Barbra for the weekend we discovered this gem, Los Agaves! We went to many places around the area for brunch, dessert, dinner, however; Los Agaves was the absolute best Mexican food restaurant. The location is not that spacious and the parking lot does not have much parking space, but that doesn't really matter - there's plenty of street parking. The burrito had shrimp and fish inside with their special chipotle sauce on top w/ pieces of mango. The burrito came with a side salad & rice (you can sub the rice or salad at no extra cost.) The employees were so nice, helpful and efficient. It was a bit busy the evening we went (Sunday around 2pm) but they still managed to take our order within a few minutes and bring out our food as fast as posible. It is on the moderate expensive side, but worth every penny. I will definitely come back here when I am in Santa Barbra again and I 100% recommend this place.",5 star rating,Mayra A.

6/2/2020,"Glendora, CA","Don't post nearly enough on Yelp.  Went to Santa Barbara   this weekend to ""pretend"" everything was normal.  Of course most of the trip focused around food!!!  Reviews looked good so I sped over there.  VERY well organized getting deliveries out the door.  I could have dined in but ""I am not quite there yet"".  Vegetarian burrito - marvelous.  STUFFED with vegetables (well that is what you would expect :)).  Rice was fair as was salad.  I don't fault them as it was to go.I am a pig and even I could not tackle this beast.Local business and great food.",5 star rating,Jennifer J.
9/8/2018,"Pasadena, CA","A must eat when in Santa Barbara we were told. Order at the counter, food delivered to the table (semi-casual setting). No one warned us of the portion size. Sea and earth molcajetes could had easily fed the two of us. Yet... my husband also opted for their agaves enchiladas. Wayyyyy over-ordered. Wayyyy overfed. But vacay life = fatty life. No regrets especially since the foods were beyond delicious! The same molcajetes would cost at least $25-$30 back in LA. Loaded with every protein imaginable (giant shrimp, flakey white fish, thick cut chorizo, diced chicken, sliced beef), topped with bubbling cheese and fresh sliced avocado, paired with house made fresh corn tortilla = meal made in vacay heaven! Agaves enchiladas - The enchiladas were well made - bursting with fish and shrimp. The fresh citrus, cranberry salad and fluffy rice paired nicely. I however didn't love their house special enchilada sauce. I thought it tasted too similar to ranch dressing (maybe with a dash of tomato sauce/salsa). My husband, on the other hand, ate every bite regardless of how stuffed he felt. Thoroughly impressed! Can totally see why they have expanded to two additional locations! Next branch- LA?! Please?!",4 star rating,Wing C.

Ordered mojado burrito and first bite was cold cheese. The whole burrito was warm while the other burrito was piping hot. Even the guacamole wasn't fresh. I have never had guacamole that tasted as bad as theirs. I honestly am writing this while my stomach is churning. May have food poisoning.The people are very kind tho.,2 star rating,Jen B.

The menu does give you a wide selection to choose from so we asked which dishes were popular and good to order (Tacos Del Mar was one of them ;) haha). Would go back. Oh, I am also a Spanish rice lover so that was the best part of my meal, but the mango dressing on the salad and the halibut tacos were tasty too.",5 star rating,A W.
10/2/2020,"Atascadero, CA",Los Agaves is always delicious and this last experience wasn't an exception. But what we really appreciated were all of the safety measures that they have put in place. All of the staff were gloved and masked with plexiglass protecting the cashier. My family and I felt very safe and were able to really enjoy our meal. 10 out of 10 job Los Agaves! Thank you very much! We'll be back for sure,5 star rating,Candice B.

So first off, you stand in line and order at the front register (they have a huge menu to read while you wait in line). You order, get a number, and pick an open table. The servers come by with chips for your table. There's a salsa bar near the cash register. I ordered the Agaves Enchiladas, they're filled with fish, shrimp and cheese topped with a chipotle creamy sauce served with a delicious fresh salad and rice. I couldn't eat fast enough!!!!!!!

7/9/2019,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",Mexican food on another level.  Did someone say mango salad? I never thought mango dressing was so good. I'm picky about margaritas de tamarindo but theirs was on point.  We ordered the queso fundido and the camarones Guajillo served with rice and a house salad with mango dressing.  The decor was warming and colorful.  You order first then you get seated.  They have a seating area in the front and the side. They have a salsa bar. I highly recommend the black roasted Chile and they guacamole salsa is good too. I definitely will be back to try more if their delicious menu and they're is something for everyone including vegans.,5 star rating,Teresa I.

10/5/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is my go-to Mexican restaurant in the Santa Barbara area. I also love Lily's Tacos--but Los Agaves has a completely different vibe. I would describe it as a more upscale Mexican restaurant, but with very quick service! They always seem to be crowded but I've never had to wait long for my food. One of my favorites is the Tacos Del Mar. This dish comes with 2 loaded tacos, a rice pilaf, and a side salad. Of course, I can't forget the basket of chips and accompanying salsa bar. You won't leave here hungry. I recommend getting one shrimp and one fish taco. You also must try the enchiladas! I love the chipotle sauce they use to top the Agaves Enchiladas, so much that I wish they had it on the salsa bar. Speaking of the salsa bar, they have about six salsa options, cilantro, and lime. By far the best is the avocado salsa. Sometimes the other salsas are a little inconsistent depending on the day.",4 star rating,Mattie W.
10/25/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","First time trying this restaurant. We ordered chicken fajitas and chicken taquitos. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. They were just okay.  For the price, you get decent amount of food. That part was good.",3 star rating,Anne P.
11/26/2018,"Long Beach, CA","The agaves burrito was OK. The fish, shrimp, peppers, and onions on the inside were good, but the monterey jack cheese and chipotle sauce just didn't fit well with it. The cheese added too much savoriness for the seafood, where I wanted something with a bit more punch to it. I thought the chipotle sauce on top would be the thing, but that ended up tasting less spicy or tangy, and more like straight mayonnaise and sour cream mixed together. All in all, it overpowered the rest of the burrito, and I found myself just trying to extract the fish, shrimp, and bell peppers from the chipotle dosed tortilla.I tried a few bites of the tampiquena. It had a lot of flavor, and was definitely better than the agaves burrito, but still nothing to write home about in my opinion.",3 star rating,Jeff L.

In addition, tons of Santa Barbara locals tell me that this is the best Mexican restaurant here.My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday at 7pm and got in a line that almost went out the door. We get our chance to order at the front at 7:20pm. We both get the agaves enchiladas and enchiladas guadalajara. After we put our order in, in which we expected him to repeat the order, he tells us that they ran out of rice. Not sure how a restaurant runs out of rice during the dinner rush on a Saturday. Nevertheless we asked if we could have extra meat or beans instead. He said that we can only have extra salad on the side. I assumed that we could be compensated for the missing rice.So we got extra salad because that was our only option. We sit down to the table and luckily we get our food within 15 minutes, hence the one star given.The reason why this restaurant is given only one star however is because the meat in our dish tasted very dry and under seasoned. We left the place rather unpleasant. We could have had our dish replaced (something we could've done on our part) but we were too displeased to do so.",1 star rating,Meghan B.
7/25/2019,"Reseda, CA",Parking was a little difficult. Honestly coming from the Valley to Santa Barbara Mexican food it was okay. The place itself is nice.

8/13/2018,"Torrance, CA","With nearly 3,000 reviews and a 4.5/5 rating, I don't know what else I can add. Yelpers were spot on with this place. My hubby and I came around 5:30 PM and there was already a line out the door. It took us about 15-20 minutes to reach the cash register. There are menus you can look at while you wait so once you're up at the front, you can tell the cashier what you want to order. A number is given, and you find a table. It was crazy busy so the waitstaff helps you find a table. If you order a margarita (made with wine), you have to wait for it on the side. PROS:*Homemade everything- their tortillas, all their sauces, most of it is made from scratch and you can taste it*Price vs portions is well balanced- we had plenty of leftovers!*Fajitas Del Mar- I give a 4/5. They went a little overboard in cooking the bell peppers and onions in too much oil. Shrimp and fish pieces were meaty and well flavored*salsa bar- you help yourself*Nachos- cheese, black beans, hard to go wrong and the dish is huge*hubs ordered the well liked Agave burrito which is a fish burrito, wet style so it is served with plenty of sauce in top*good service- despite how crazy it was inside, all of the servers were working hard and friendlyCONS:My gosh, it is crowded. One restroom for women and the line next to the ordering line was over crowding the drink and salsa bar line. It was mayhem. Parking is on the streets, we parked quite a bit away uphill. They need to clear empty dishes faster off of tables. We had a small table and all the dishes are served on big glass plates- it was struggle to fit everything on our table.I do see why it's popular, so I may return if I'm in the Santa Barbara area again.",5 star rating,Tina S.

They were out of a few drinks we wanted, and the mole was a bit sweeter to our taste. All salsas from the self-serve bar were fabulous!

8/13/2018,"Glendale, CA","La Super-Rica is usually our go-to Mexican restaurant whilst in Santa Barbara but we decided to try Los Agaves after reading the stellar yelp reviews. Wow - change is good!Our group ordered the Chiles Norteños (poblano chiles stuffed with shrimp and Monterey cheese), Tacos Del Mar (shrimp tacos with mango, cabbage, onions), Chile Relleno Burrito and the Chile Verde Burrito. Based on the reactions from my fellow diners all were quite delicious and all pointedly refused to share.  That's a first. I can speak about the Chile's Norteños. The Chile's Norteños included perfectly cooked shrimp stuffed into beautifully charred poblano - the combination of smoke and spice was incredible. Wash is down with a Modelo or Tamarind soda - you won't be disappointed. Ordering was fast and efficient but the kitchen was a bit slow. Nothing too concerning but just worth noting.I'm definitely coming back but next time I'll have a much lighter lunch. Less likely to have leftovers, which isn't a bad thing, but it is if you forget them at your brother in laws house (damn it!).",5 star rating,Dan K.
12/28/2019,"Oakland, CA","It was all right. One of those places that has 4+ stars on Yelp but is really more of a 3 star. We weren't off to a good start when the cashier asked if we could pay our tip in cash after seeing us write down 20% on the receipt. This was so tacky! Just be appreciative to my face...and...talk shit later. (It was small thing and yeah yeah yeah I know cash is better, but it really rubbed me the wrong way)We ordered a tamal plate, two tacos, and a side of chile relleno. The food arrived 45 minutes after we sat down, at which point we were full on chips and salsa. The staff seemed antsy to clear our table even though we were missing a dish. The food itself was actually cold and just okay, bordering on chain restaurant quality. But the casual atmosphere and long wait intoxicates you into believing the food is awesome. I'd almost prefer dining at a random Chevys where I know they won't ask for a $9 cash tip, make me grab my utensils, and then serve cold food.",3 star rating,Leah F.

7/6/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Los Agaves is a great spot to hit, whether it's lunch or dinner (or even in between). Most likely you will hit a line out the door, which is fine considering it will move quickly due to the efficient nature of the staff. The system to order and pay for what they offer before being seated is very convenient; remarkably the food comes in a fast food food time frame (yet still retaining a higher quality). It's almost amazing how they operate, but it works very well. Don't be stressed about finding a table, be on the look out for an open table but the staff will make sure you're seated. It is important to come with an appetite as the portions are quite large, most of what is on the menu will be great so it's very easy to finish it all but try out the tacos and horchata (I recommend the Tacos Norteño - something with a N which includes steak, bacon, and guacamole).Make sure to ask for the horchata in a glass (less plastic waste) and hit the salsa bar afterwards for the chips they immediately bring to the table. I also suggest making a trip up to Franceschi Park after or before a meal at Los Agaves for a wonderful view of Santa Barbara (although they really should cut the trees to open the view).",5 star rating,Blake H.
8/24/2020,"Rancho Mirage, CA","What a great experience!  It seemed that they are doing really well through COVID-19 providing a nice al fresco dining atmosphere along with delicious food and impressive service.For ""dine-in,"" guests order and pay in advance at the counter.  Guests are provided with a number as a table marker and food runners/servers deliver the order to your table.  Servers provide chips and salsa to the table while they are preparing entrees.The most impressive dish visibly and tastefully was Sea & Earth Molcajetes.  It was enough food for two or for one very hungry person.  We had to ask for more tortillas to accommodate the entree.  Steak Picado was another large portion of food which was equally tasteful.  Two combination plates rounded out the order: crispy chicken tacos and chile relleno.  The single item combination plates are good size portions where you don't leave overstuffed.  We could only give this place 4-stars as we've had better chile rellenos elsewhere.Overall, the food was hot, fresh and very flavorful.  Whenever we requested something, there were no questions asked and delivered promptly (i.e. additional tortillas).It was great to see them busy with dine-in, as well as a brisk take-out business.  Congrats on maintaining your high standards, as well as providing a great customer experience during these trying times.  Magnifico!",4 star rating,Peter H.

7/15/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is so BOMBBBBB. You look at the menu and think two tacos for $14 is expensive (which yeah it kinda is) but their tacos are huuuge. They were so filling and so delicious and they do not jip you on the meat. The carne asada was so delicious and not dry all. Its different in that the meat is like cut up steak rather than the kind of meat you see at food trucks. It also comes with your choice of black or pinto beans in a crispy tortilla cup and mexican rice on the side. I thought I'd still be hungry after this, but I couldnt even finish my plate (at least the beans portion).They also have a selection of drinks and beers to choose from. The horchata was very good, not too sweet and not too cinnamon-y. Theres also a bar for limes, sauces, cilantro, onion, salsa, etc. at your disposal. The meal also comes with complimentary chips while you wait for your real meal to roll through.

I give it 4 stars because the food never fails but the chips on the table were very oily and we're not appealing when you went in or a grab and your finger stayed greasy. The girl at the register was like any other girl at any register no one is too happy in customer service. We ordered a wet burrito carnitas taco steak taco kids quesadilla and a side of rice.

(See pic)Ordered for pick up as soon as we got into Santa Barbara.  I loved that I could order and pay right off the Yelp app.  It would've been nice to eat out here, but we just got into town and baby was fussy.Hubs got the halibut tacos ($13.50) which weren't as tasty as my Chile Releno veggie burrito, but probably healthier and it was still really good.  Came with a huge bag of chips we couldn't eat because we were full.  Seemed expensive for Mexican food but I had enough leftover for another meal the next day so it was worth it!",4 star rating,Patra G.

6/4/2020,"White Plains, NY",To be honest I think I make better Mexican food at 2 am drunk and on xanex seriously if melting cheese on nacho chips or a flour tortilla then shoot me . Disgrace to Mexican food just got to chipotle better run for your money . The nachos barely had any Chips and even less cheese 45 dollars for a empty quesadilla and some mediocre nachos with a bit of extra guacamole ( guacamole was flavorless and used with Avocados not ripe enough.

5/15/2020,"Orlando, FL","Ordered takeout on a midweek stay in Santa Barbara, and it was fantastic! We had an order of the taquitos, nachos and flautas and the only reason it wasn't 5 stars was because we ordered chicken flautas and of the 3 flautas only one was chicken and the other two were beef.  Also for takeout they probably should have left the sauce on the side for the flautas because it made the middle a bit soggy.  Overall though it was very tasty and I would definitely go back!!",4 star rating,Gabi Z.

5/26/2018,"Aliso Viejo, CA","Some people visit Santa Barbara for the beach. I visit Santa Barbara for Los Agaves. This place has some of the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down. I usually order the Tacos Del Mar and have never been disappointed. My friends usually get the agaves burrito, which is also fantastic. The tacos consist of a heaping plate of two tacos (shrimp or halibut or one of each) filled with mango and sauce and cabbage, a pyramid of the most delicious rice, and a sweet salad with cranberries and mandarin orange slices. The chips are great and the green salsa is incredible. For breakfast, their breakfast quesadilla is where it's at, and is easily enough for two meals. Prices are incredible for what you get, service has always been great.This place is worth the wait or the semi-difficult seating.",5 star rating,Heather R.
4/1/2018,"Berkeley, CA","Mexican-American from NorCal. Having grown up with homemade Mexican food, I'm picky about Mexican restaurants, but this was immediately one of my favorites! 5/5 service, 4/5 food, 5/5 ambiance. I got the combo plate with an enchilada roja and a soft taco, and both were great. The arroz rojo tastes like my mom's, and the carne asada, gently wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla, was tender. The beans came in a little taco shell bowl, which was cute (and also tasty). I try to reserve 5s for food that's unique or outstanding, but I've bumped this review up to 5 because the restaurant itself was nicely decorated, the food was pretty good, and all the employees were friendly and efficient. I've never been a fan of burritos, but my boyfriend had the chile verde burrito and describes it with the following caveman-like description: ""Big hunks. Meat. Juicy."" Clearly only one of us is a Yelper ;)Being from the Bay Area, I've started paying close attention to bathrooms - there are TWO individual bathrooms here, one for each gender. We parked on the street nearby with no problems, though it looks as though you could easily park in their lot as well. They make it easy to figure out that you order at the counter and seat yourself. Fresh Peruvian lilies adorned each table. It was a bit loud, but could be a casual place for a date or a family meal out.Try it out! We loved it.",5 star rating,Joan C.
3/19/2019,"Durham, NC","My friends and I were visiting Santa Barbara on vacation. We walked into this place around 3pm - riiiight in the middle of happy hour, YAS! So, they do have a happy hour menu. It's not really advertised well, but luckily Yelp reviews/pics told me otherwise. We asked the guy at the register, and he honored the happy hour menu. The margaritas were only $4, and the house margarita was the best. The food was good too. It is heavy, so we didn't really eat dinner since this was a laaaate lunch (linner?). Best part of the whole place - SALSA BAR!! So many salsa options: chipotle, habanero, tomatillo, serrano, etc. The habanero hurt in all the right ways LOL. If you're craving some decently priced Mexican food, this place hits the spot.",5 star rating,Priyanka G.

We both got the trios with three items for $14 each. They come around and serve you free chips once you're seated & they have a delicious salsa bar that's free. The food took about 10 minutes to arrive. It was massive! Biggest relleno I've ever had and the sauces were incredible. The taco meat is a bit greasy but other than that everything was so good. They have fountain drinks, margaritas & beer. Plenty of street parking nearby.",5 star rating,Alex E.
11/24/2019,"Fremont, CA","Now THAT was delicious! Oh yeah! I would say this just might be the BEST Mexican food I've ever had. I ordered the Tampiqueña because it was my first time and I could decide what I really wanted. This dish gave me options to try. Every bite was delicious! My steak was cooked to perfection. The chicken enchilada (which I don't usually enjoy) was pleasing. The sauce was less bitter and more well rounded than past enchilada sauces I've had. I even enjoyed the crispy little roasted onion. Warning, though! The pretty roasted pepper isn't a gentle yellow pepper like thought. The spicy brought tears to my eyes and made me laugh because it totally caught me off guard.And can I just tell you about the salsa bar? I tried 4 different kinds and every single one was outstanding. And I appreciated that their salsa cups were a generous size, none of those short flat cups here. BAM!I And the guacamole. Hands down... WHAM! SO good!Thought the ""order at counter"" was great but it had a great sit down vibe.I'll be back the next time I'm in town.Fantastic!",5 star rating,Juliana T.

These other thousands of reviews don't lie; such good Mexican food and there was a bit of a wait even at 1pm but it moved along quickly and we got a table before our food arrived. Everything we ordered was really good - the veggie suiza (enchiladas), and the steak wet burrito (burrito mojado). We also got a fizzy guava soda that was hella good. The chips and salsa are really; we tried all their salsas and really liked a few of them. Overall, this place has some legit good food.

I have always loved Mexican food and the food here totally made me super happy!You need to order at the counter and they will serve you your order at your table. They served us some complimentary Tortilla Chips and we picked our choices of Salsa from their amazing Salsa bar. The bar had so many varieties of salsa that I was stoked and wanted to try everything. The options were vast and we picked around 6 varieties and loved each one of them. Ordered Tacos del Mar and Garden Burrito and loved both! The Chipotle sauce in Tacos del Mar was so creamy and tasty. It left me wanting more. The house salad alongside the burritos gave a very refreshing take on the dish.

I think it means a lot that Los Agaves' basic things like chips, rice, and all their housemade sauces are so good, so you can't even go wrong if you just go wrong with anything here!

10/23/2018,"Alhambra, CA","First time here, and most likely won't be the last.  Besides the relaxing environment and the very friendly staff, this family oriented restaurant has an extensive menu of delicious food to choose from.  As a vegetarian, I had more than enough options!I ordered the Chile Relleno Burrito, which comes with black beans and Monterey Jack cheese wrapped in a large flour tortilla and topped with our own chipotle sauce. There's rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo on the side.  This was delicious!  Also, the portion was pretty big.  I was unable to finish my plate on my own.  This plate was obviously NOT vegan, so if you have specific dietary requests, you should ask them if they are able to accommodate.  The Tacos Al Pastor, which comes as two pork tacos with pineapple, onions, garlic and guajillo sauce, served with rice and pinto beans on the side, is said to be quite a winner at this restaurant as well.  Unfortunately I have been out of touch with pork for a few years so I'll have to take my someone else's word for it.  We also ordered the Guacamole, which has fresh avocado, onions, cilantro and garlic.  Also, a great choice for starters!  This came with tortilla chips, but keep in mind that every table gets a complimentary basket of tortilla chips to start.  In short, there were a lot of chips! I'm glad I was able to try this place!  i've been reading that they are able to make a lot of substitutions for vegetarians, so I'm excited to try a new dish the next time I'm in the area!",5 star rating,Jennifer T.

2/8/2019,"Milpitas, CA","The Californian Mexican food in large portions that can be shared family style. About $100 for 5 plates and 2 appetizers. Enough food for 6 adults and 2 babies. We're pretty happy with the service, the speed of the line, 10 min wait for food to come out (this was at around 1pm). I came here while vacationing with my husband's parents, his sister + husband, and our little boys (baby and tot). I was so happy that they got us a set up with a large table and a high chair during their busy Sunday lunch hour. Very accommodating for our family. As a new mom, this was very practical and helpful.Now about the food: loved the cerviche and the flautas (beef). I had to explain what cerviche was to grandparents, they thought it was a glorified salsa, and then they saw shrimp. (Oh! That's good! yes yes mother)i didn't care for the nachos with all those toppings, doesn't seem so special to me, but my Asian American family likes it. babies like it. babies also likes the beans and rice on the sides. so there something for everyone in the family!fish tacos were the least tasty - don't bother with it.",5 star rating,Jen L.
10/25/2018,"Cottonwood, CA","Possibly some of the best mexican food I have ever eaten in California.  I have to thank my fellow Yelpers, we were driving up from LA on Highway 101 and decided to pull off to give this place a shot.  Trying to park a long bed F150 4x4 Pick up made the stop a little more interesting, but we made it happen after getting ""creative"" in the back parking lot behind Los Agaves.  We came in the back door, and found a walk up counter where you order your food from a menu and then are given a number to place on the table.  The line was about 4 to 5 people deep, but went pretty quickly.  We stepped up and ordered Tacos Del Mar, we had to try the Fish Taco of course, but also tried: Shrimp, Chicken, Pork, and Steak, in addition, I saw a guy with the wet burrito so I ordered a Steak Wet Burrito to add to our lunch.  Like most couples, we order a little bit of this and that and each get to taste several things on the menu.    They gave us some chips, so we wandered over to their cute little Salsa Bar and got some salsas for the chips and for the tacos.  SInce we were driving, it was a no on Cerveza, but if you are chilling, they had a decent Beer Selection.The food showed up about 10 minutes later, the smells were amazing, and the food was hot and steamy.  I loved everything that I tried at Los Agaves.  We were pretty lucky, because we caught them before the big lunch rush.  We watched the line get longer and longer as we ate, and were grateful that we arrived when we did.  I wish that we lived closer to this place than 500+ miles away, because this would be our ""go to"" for mexican food.   Next time we are strolling though Santa Barbara we will definitely pop in here again.",5 star rating,Noel L.
10/24/2018,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA","I stopped by when I was on my way to a weekend camping trip and it was so good that I had to get it again on my way back but I ended up inviting a bunch of other people to join me.A must-try restaurant if you're ever in the Santa Barbara area, and you don't have to just take my word for it (No. 16 on Yelp's top 100 Places to Eat in 2016 in the U.S.) Their dishes are classic Mexican cuisine with a creative take. There is almost always a good wait after it gained so much popularity on Yelp! Once you order your food at the counter, it will be brought to your table (if you can find seating!). I've only tried the Los Agaves Enchiladas and Los Agaves Burrito which are essentially the same tastes in different forms. Los Agaves Enchiladas - Fresh fish, shrimp, red peppers, onions, and plenty of signature chipotle sauce with a side of rice and salad. Their most famous dish which definitely lives up to the accolades. It's the sauce that really elevates this dish.Definitely planning on eating here whenever I'm in Santa Barbara. Their salsas are also all homemade and you can definitely taste the quality. Really hoping they open one up in LA/OC...",5 star rating,Kevin N.

12/2/2018,"Anaheim, CA","I'm so blown away by this place... actually kind of sad we don't have them down here in OC! When we do mini weekend vacations in the central coast or anything where we have to drive back down to So Cal, we try to take the scenic 101 and stop in SB. We love this city and try to do a lunch at a different spot each time. So beyond happy with lunch at Los Agaves. From the moment we walk in, we just felt so welcomed by all staff despite how busy it was. I loved the fast casual concept. We step to the counter and ordered and received a number. Local brews and SB wines available which is amazing. I hit up the salsa bar.... and I'm a salsa bar enthusiast. So many options! All so done so well and delicious! We sit and not too long after, we receive our appetizer. We ordered the chorizo queso fundido. Served with delicious homemade tortillas. This was ooey, gooey cheesy goodness. Entrees arrived shortly after. At this point, we've already had several people ask us if we needed anything or if they could get us anything. Service was top notch, better than most full service sit down restaurants. This was such a unique concept and I fully appreciated it. Back to the food. I ordered the arrachera and it came with a stuffed pepper and my husband ordered the enchilada suizas. Both were just perfect and tasty. My meat was tender and grilled perfectly. The cheesy pepper was just cheesy deliciousness. My husbands enchiladas had perfect big chicken chunks and just full of flavor. Beans were a miss but everything else was tasty so I didn't really care. I saw the managers and owners working so hard. I think it was all family. The older man who I believe was the owner stopped and touched every table, including ours, with a big genuine smile. I saw a younger manager looking guy running food and doing the same. They tidied up the salsa bar often, pre-bussed tables and kept the restaurant clean. The bathroom was immaculate... with a Dyson AND paper tables to appease all preferences. Aside from the incredibly tasty food, I was just blown away by the level of service, care, quality, and attention to every detail of this establishment. I know why they're busy and I would return back time and time again if I was local. I now understand why they have almost 3k reviews and remain at 4.5 stars. I'm so impressed with this place and can't wait to return on our next stop in SB. Come to OC, Los Agaves! Spread your love south!",5 star rating,Catherine C.

My husband and I walked in one day and loved the food so much we decided to invite our family and have dinner here after our wedding . The owner personally reached out to me and made sure the facility was ready for our special day. They even made a special menu free  to make our event run  smoothly .  Upon arrival the eating area was clean and even decorated for us with flowers and special seating for my husband and I . We had a wonderful waitress named Érica who was sweet , patient , detail oriented , and fun! Everyone's food is was perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!! There was not one empty dish in the house . we not once felt rushed or stressed . I ate my favorite dish which was stuffed peppers with cheese and meat ( yummmm) and my husband ate the wet burrito ( which was a favorite ) .

The only negative was a homeless woman came into the restaurant, wandered around, staff seemed to ignore her but it was disturbing for guests, she was obviously on something. I feel compassion for people in need but as a paying customer think the staff should not allow this. As we were leaving, the woman was eating food from a takeout container near our car. Nice for the restaurant to help her but as mentioned wish she didn't wander around while we were eating.",3 star rating,Jenna J.
1/6/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Los Agaves does not disappoint! Usually my biggest complaint would be the order line, which is also totally understandable because this place is so good. Even so, we have always found a table by the time our food was ready. This time we found only a couple people ahead of us for our late lunch. And the food came practically flying out as it arrived with the complimentary basket of tortilla chips. For my order I was almost swayed in so many directions but stuck with one of my favorites, the tostada salad and wife got some grilled fish tacos that were delicious. The salsa bar offers many great fresh options, which I dished straight into my taco bowl to avoid the wasteful plastic containers. Perhaps our biggest delight was that they now have real tequila! We felt obligated to support this development with a couple of Agaves margaritas and a fresh draft Modelo beer back.  I also joined their new reward program on Thankx app for $5 off (if joined prior to order) and a rolling reward which I entend to cash in on.",5 star rating,Jim H.
11/9/2017,"Austin, TX","Los Agaves was one of the top rated places to show up on yelp when I was looking for a place to eat in Santa Barbara. My boyfriend and I decided to drop by to grab some dinner when we were in town. Turns out you walk up to a counter, place your order, and then seat yourself. There are two large dining areas with tables so the place is pretty big. I think there is a small parking lot also right behind it.As first timers here, we weren't sure what to order. The menu is pretty big and there is a large board with specials above the counter. I guess it looked like we were thinking hard because one of the staff members came by and talked to us about the menu. He was really nice and mentioned the molcajetes. We didn't want to get two large meals so we ended up ordering the sea and earth molcajetes along with two fish tacos (from the side orders section). Our food came out and we realized that what we ordered could've sufficed as two large meals.Sea & Earth Molcajetes -- I think the sea and earth molcajetes was a bit overpriced. It's about $18 and it comes out in a large stone bowl (just like what you'd see if you searched for ""molcajete""). In the bowl you'll find a tomato based soup/stew that's filled with some seafood and meats (I think there was some chicken and chorizo). You'll also find some other things such as cheese, onion, and avocado. The stew has a nice little kick to it and it's pretty good - very flavorful. The molcajetes also comes with a few tortillas.Fish Taco(s) -- The other item we ordered was the fish tacos. The two tacos took over a plate and they were overloaded with the filling. Unfortunately, there wasn't much flavor to them. I can't put my finger on it but something was causing them to be bland - it was like there was something missing. Definitely a bit overpriced for being $5.50 a piece.I think Los Agaves is supposed to be a big deal. When I was in line for the restroom I saw an article pinned up about Los Agaves being the #16 on Yelp's top 100 places to eat in the U.S.. I definitely want to go back the next time I'm in Santa Barbara and try something different!",3 star rating,Sasha G.

9/8/2018,"Healdsburg, CA","Los Agaves gets high ratings because it has great food!  I'm not crazy about the ""grab a number and sit down"" experience though.  For the order, one must stand in a line and wait to order food and drinks, grab a number and sit at a table and wait.  This particular location is weak logistically to service all the people.  The long line cuts across the path of the people from the kitchen who must cut through the line to bring the food out.  Bring in a family of 5 who cannot figure out what they want and there is a mob of people staring at the menu oblivious to the servers or anyone else.  I also like the option of ordering more drinks but I'm not thrilled to get up and go to the end of a line to get another drink.The prices here are good.  I suppose their business strategy of ""grab a number and sit down"" keeps a steady stream of people moving through the restaurant to sell more meals at a lower cost because of higher volume.  No  lost time waiting for the check, having the server run it back to the register and back to you.   Just  order, pay up, eat and leave.  You get to be your own waiter.  ""Hi, my name is [fill in your name here].  I'm going to be your waiter tonight.""I had the carne asada, rare.  It was nicely cooked and accompanied with grilled peppers - one filled with cheese.  It was a good meal!  Lots of flavor and carefully prepared.If you like good Mexican food and don't mind the ""grab a number and sit down"" routine, this is a good place to have a meal!",4 star rating,Steve S.

9/11/2017,"San Marcos, TX","My wife and, while on our mini getaway to Santa Barbara, were looking for quality dinner options on a Monday night. We actually checked out both Yelp and TripAdvisor and Los Agaves kept popping up high on their list. It seemed like a no brainer to check them out.We arrived right before 6:00 PM and the parking lot behind the restaurant was quite empty...we even thought they weren't open quite yet, but they were.Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly staff member, Jamie, who informed us we just needed to check out the menu as well as the menu items up on the wall behind the counter, place our order, fill our drinks, find a table, then display the number handed to us and a server will deliver our food to our table.Before long, fresh tortilla chips were delivered to our table and my wife was off to the salsa bar with their myriad of delectable salsa choices with varying heat. She opted for the tomatillo (medium) and pico de gallo and I tried the salsa made with some grilled peppers. I think we liked the tomatillo best.My wife ordered the chili verde burrito served with Spanish rice, sour cream and guacamole. I inquired about their molcajetes as one was served past us as we were making our choices, but in the end I opted for the steak picado served with Spanish rice, beans and fresh corn tortillas. Both our dishes were full of flavor and my wife loved how tender the meat was. Portions were also quite generous.In addition to the flavorful dishes and huge portions, service was friendly and attentive. We liked how the manager, Ray, interacted with the customers and eagerly communicated how the owners were from Mexico and travelled extensively throughout Mexico to pick out dishes for inclusion into their menu.All in all, a very good experience! Dinner for 2 came out to just over $36 but we left a generous tip on top of that. We'll have to come back here the next time we're in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Mel M.

First you go to the counter place your order, then get a seat. The staff was very helpful in helping find a seat even though they were packed at 7pm on a Saturday. The food came quickly and did not disappoint. We ordered the queso with chorizo. It was served with fresh hot tortillas, it was to die for!!  The cheese, peppers, and chorizo tasted phenomenal together! I'm still thinking about it!

I always compare any Mexican food to the type of cooking I grew up with from my grandmother.  Unfortunately, nothing ever really comes close.Los Agaves came close to the quality of Mexican food that I grew up with.  The chili rellenos were close to perfection. The perfect balance of chili, cheese, batter and sauce. I only ordered one as part of a combo plate but wish I had ordered two...they were that good.Since I don't live in Santa Barbara, I have to ask myself, ""Is driving an hour and a half for delicious Mexican food worth it?""

7/10/2017,"Long Beach, CA","Bomb flavors and large portions! You are likely to find a line when you arrive, but they are quick at getting people up to the counter to order and surprisingly it wasn't hard to find a seat. You seat yourself, but if you need help they will assist you in getting a table ready. We found the ordering and seating process to be simple. We helped ourselves to the self-serve salsa bar. It not only houses a variety of salsas, but also onions, cilantro, peppers, etc. Seriously, load up on the salsas. There is a good variety but my favorites were the salsa verde and especially the avocado salsa. We accidentally took too many, so we even brought the extras home because it was that good. The food arrived at our table rather quickly and even though the utensils and napkins are out for you to retrieve yourself, the employees were nice enough to bring them to the table for us. My sister and I split the Burrito Mojado. Upon arriving it didn't look that large, but with the chips it was the perfect amount of food for us. It contains grilled chicken or steak (we chose steak), pinto beans and queso fresco topped with salsa roja. On the side is rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and pico. Everything was delicious and I only wish we lived closer so that we could come more often.",4 star rating,Morgan H.

It's like trying to recreate that fabulous first date. Usually it gets better but the second date shouldn't be worse than the first?! Make sense? I'm going to need some jewelry.Ordering was easy and fast. The place was not too busy. We ordered the fish tacos and the squash quesadilla.Sadly for the price the servings were not as generous as our last visit.  The slaw on the tacos was bland. The squash ""quesadilla"" was actually an empanada?  The salad was missing some cranberries.Maybe they changed chefs?Overall, for the price point and lack of flavor on the tacos...and small servings... I didn't return for the rest of my visit in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Bunny G.

And the reality is that they would not be able to serve the constant stream of customers if they did do full service. But even without full wait service the staff brought the food out fast and helped whenever needed and were as friendly as could be.Your first clue of how good the food is is that they were confident enough to put the restaurant just steps from La Super-Rica. You better back up that move with great food and Los Agaves does just that. And the Agaves buritto is simply amazing. Great food and great service are hard to complain about.

The food is 4 star realistically, with slightly expensive, larger than necessary portions and occasionally over cheesed/oiled...  but I'm giving an extra star because even when they are busy in the restaurant, they kick butt with the service. Whoever manages this place keeps their staff working hard and being kind to the customer, which is getting hard to find these days. The burritos are huge, and me and my girlfriend split one and are happy and full, which makes the cost quite affordable. No need to over order here.",5 star rating,Skyler P.
6/25/2018,"Santa Monica, CA","Los Agaves is the best Mexican Food in The United States!!! I know, it's a bold statement! But sometimes you have to go out on a limb and be heard!! Holler from the roof tops: ""LOS AGAVES ON MILPAS IS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN THE US!!!""Los Agaves wasn't named best taco by Julia Child! I could care less. I knew Julia Child, ate Breakfast with her in Aspen, and she never mentioned anything about Tacos! I go to Los Agaves because it's extraordinary!!! Standing in line to order I'm tempted by all the dishes people are eating! Do I order the Molcajetes, the enchiladas, the tacos? Maybe a combo plate? It's impossible to decide! Each dish is perfect in execution!!! Today my wife and I shared an order of Guacamole and the House Special Molcajetes Arrachera, basically a carved lava mortar and pestle bowl, that is filled with Arrachera (skirt steak), grilled nopal, Monterey Jack, chorizo, grilled chambray onion, avocado, grilled peppers and salsa! It radiates heat as it has been sitting on an open flame! It's boiling hard. I dip a homemade flour tortilla into the hot spicy red broth just for a taste, and my mind exploded!!! My wife was equally stunned! It is not often, being from Los Angeles, with a wife from New Mexico that we encounter something completely new and off the charts in Mexican Cuisine. In many ways this dish reminded me of the originality of food found in New Mexico or the  Tlacoyos and Tlayudas found in Oaxaca neighborhoods in Los Angeles! This is a dish that took my breath away!! Los Agaves is wonderful! The entire experience is! The service is very quick, very friendly! There was a huge line, out the door and down the street at 2:00Pm on a Saturday, but it moved quickly, and in the process I discovered something new to eat!!! Bravo!!!",5 star rating,David R.
10/31/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I have heard amazing thing about Los Agaves and had to try it when I went to santa Barbara. At first I was shocked that it was order at the counter but that didn't make or break my experience. Everything on the menu looked amazing, I had a hard time choosing what to get. I decided to get the shrimp fajitas which was a great choice!! They were one of the most expensive things on the menu ($17) which isn't bad and speaks to the inexpensiveness of the restaurant. After we ordered food, we found a table and enjoyed chips and salsa. Their salsas weren't my favorite and the chips could have been hotter. When my food came it was steaming and looked amazing. Pretty big portion and huge shrimps!! It tasted amazing! The veggies were delicious and so were the shrimps! It was a good mixture of shrimp to veggie ratio. The only thing I was missing was maybe a zucchini in the fajitas but that's it! They were so good and really well seasoned! My plate came with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream! The beans were decent but the real winner was the rice! It was so good and flavorful. I came in to Los Agaves not hungry and left eating all of my food!",4 star rating,Allie R.

7/29/2019,"Redondo Beach, CA","We first went to Los Agaves in January 2018. We loved it so much that we ate there twice over a weekend. In my mind, it beaconed as a reason why going back to Santa Barbara on its own.I'm kind of glad we did not because we had lunch there last Sunday on our drive back from Cambria.I could say that I am more accustomed to Mexican food after moving to LA, but I was far less amazed than a year and a half ago. It is good, but not amazing. Especially, I remember the Molcajetes was far richer, more creamy and tasted long cooked, with lots of cheese melted inside, and overall darker with the meat melting inside: this time I got the chicken molcajetes, it was more tomato-y than spicey, and the chicken was regular grilled chicken that was thrown in just before. I actually seem to recall that upon our first visit they told us that the molcajetes would take longer to prepare, while this time it arrived instantly.On Sundays it is very very crowded. It's perfectly fine, but it also means that as you eat the staff will be constantly rearranging tables and chairs around you to accomodate the patrons as they arrive.Due to the chaos, service was so-so: we were not offered any refill of salsa, and the guacamole we ordered never arrived so that, at one point, we asked if we could had another Margarita instead: they obliged, but I don't know which one was more expensive. Now that I think of it, being past 2PM, we clearly lost at the exchange.Basically, either the quality went downhill in a year, or I got much more acquainted with the SoCal Mexican food scene so that I was less impressed... one thing for sure: avoid this place on Sundays at rush hour.",3 star rating,Tommaso B.

6/5/2017,"Torrance, CA","I'm so glad I stopped by on my trip to SB! My friend said they had the best chicken torta he's ever had and it was also recommended by a friend who goes to ucsb, we had to try it. Parking-Not sure if theres a lot behind, but there's street parking available. You get in line and order first before sitting down. All the empty tables have a number on it but you give them the number that was on there once you sit down. I think it's so customers who order first have a table reserved for them. Also if you plan to order to go, I'd recommend calling your order in. There were a lot of people standing by the salsa bar while waiting for their food. Also you can't really tell who's waiting in line for the restroom and who's waiting for food since everyones just standing around. My bf and I tried a bunch of different places before coming here so we wanted to split something small. We couldn't find the torta so we asked when we ordered and the girl said they only have the torta at certain times of the year. hopefully the next time I stop by, they have the tortas. We got the beef enchilada plate with a beef taco on the side. You get chips once you sit down and grab some salsa from the salsa bar. The chips were so good! I don't know if they make them there but I really liked it. Also the salsas were really good. the green/avocado salsa had a kick to it but I loved it. the enchilada was really good and had a lot of meat inside of it. The rice.... omg SO GOOD. probably the best I've ever had. Also the beans were really good too. I really don't like beans and they had the refried beans but it tasted so good. I could actually eat it with my food. The taco was also good too! my bf really liked it. overall I really liked the food here. Tastes really good, fresh and authentic.

7/4/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is the premier Los Agaves in Santa Barbara. Ive been to the Los Agaves in Goleta and on De La Vina street on a few occasions and none of them comes close to the consistency of this location. After living in San Diego for several years I've developed this insatiable desire for good Mexican food on an almost daily basis. The Agaves burrito here is one of the best wet seafood burritos I have ever had; it comes with halibut, shrimp, guacamole, and monterey jack cheese. They also throw in a delicious side of fried rice and house salad that's topped with fruit and vinaigrette. The portions here are gigantic and could easily feed a couple people so come hungry. In the main room it also has an open salsa bar that's constantly well stocked with a ton of variety sauces from pico de gallo to spicy tapatio.  The service here is quick and they do a fantastic job keeping the restrooms and tables clean. It was a busy tuesday afternoon and they had my burrito out to me in 4-5 minutes tops along with a delicious cup of horchata. Parking can be kind of a pain in the evenings especially in the 7-8pm timeframe.

6/5/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",For mothers day we decided to take our mother in law to Santa Barbara to get our wine on and our Mexican food grub on. I know .. strange to think of getting good authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara. My mother in law is a huge Mexican food lover so I looked up the local eats and had to check out Los Agaves. Arrived on a Saturday around 11pm and there was already a huge crowd. Good sign. We were seated right away and we got :Guacamole - So fresh!!! So vibrant! They have a full salsa bar as well so you can almost make your own nachos 0_0Sea & Earth Molcajetes - I died and went to heaven. My sister in law kept trying to eat my molcajetes and I had to shoot her dirty looks. I dont mind sharing food but not when its this good! Has a little heat but not really spicy. The seafood is huge and fresh. They also give you handmade tortillas and when you make little tacos out of the sauce and the protein its magic. Enchiladas - So soft so delicious! Mother in law loved it. Sister in law had a fish dish that was topped with pineapples but it was a special of the day. Again the seafood here is amazing and so delicious. We all left very impressed by the service an the food. My mother in law asked me for the business card so she could bring my father in law. All the way to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles.

12/18/2019,"Glendora, CA","This is my second time here in a four year span (don't get to Santa Barbara as much as I'd like), and nothing has changed in terms of how incredibly LEGIT this establishment is!! One major thing that *has changed on our end and since our first visit is that the esposo and I have had gone plant-based. He is much more militant than me-- i.e. I will let some things slide when I'm eating out (cheese, an egg, etc). I'm happy to report that Los Agaves were incredibly great about accommodating vegan requests. Their food overall is just how I remembered it: fresh, homemade where possible, and absolutely delicious! I couldn't wait to have my daughter's left over rice and beans, sipping their flavorful horchata (sipping* because I want to relish it!), and chomping down their chips and multiple levels of spiciness salsas. The hubby inhaled their mushroom tacos, and I had a delightfully filling and healthy salad (SO hard to come by in a Mexican restaurant!).  The cherry on top was the service: all smiles and occasional visit from what looked like the owner to make sure our group was doing well. If you're in the mood for Mexican grub and in SB proper, I cannot recommend Los Agaves enough!!",5 star rating,Lisa V.
11/17/2018,"Santa Ana, CA","Best Mexican food in Santa Barbara.  Fresh ingredients, large menu, and delectable sauces and salsas, make this a must lunch or dinner experience in a city filled with top-notch competition.   Be ready to queue up in a short line to place your order.  However, the wait for your food will be less than 15 minutes.  This is not a place to spark up a romance  or engage in quiet conversation.  If, instead, you desire healthy portions of caloric rich south of the border heaven in a bustling decibel filled environment, then you found it here.  The two signs of a successful Mexican restaurant are seeing local Mexicans eating there and a Rolex on the wrist of the attentive owner.   This place has both.",5 star rating,Eric T.
9/11/2020,"NORTHRIDGE, CA","4 1/2 stars! This was our first experience eating here. As the vast majority who have reviewed earlier, this place is a very good value. Food is tasty, fresh, plentiful and  reasonably priced for Santa Barbara. Service was a little slow completing our lunch with missing utensils, water, etc. They perhaps were overwhelmed with customers. On the good side, you can eat behind the establishment in the comfortable patio area and they serve food on real plates with real utensils, not paper and plastic. The specials as well as regular menu items are both well made! Their sauces were homemade. Of course you get served chips and sauces until the food comes.The place is about seven blocks east of State street and located on a corner. They take credit cards as well as cash. They have one restroom each for His and Hers so be prepared to wait if a busy day. Overall a good experience and would return again.",4 star rating,Mickey Y.
4/20/2017,"Houston, TX","According to some of the stickers at the restaurant, Los Agaves was rated the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara. When and by whom, I'll never know, but I'm hard-pressed to disagree.At 5 PM on a Friday, Los Agaves was plenty packed. Thankfully, the structure of the restaurant entrance is set up so that you can stand off to the side and decide what to get from their large menus. I have friends who are big fans of their burrito mojado, flautas, enchiladas, mole, and even their chips and guac, so it doesn't seem like you can go wrong here.Last week, I sprung for their tacos plaza de toros, which include carne asada, chorizo, and chicharron to top it off. The plate comes with a roasted pepper, fried garlic bulb, and a mini tortilla shell filled with pico de gallo and guacamole. While their carne asada isn't nearly as flavorful as Lilly's, their chicharron and chorizo shone. The pico de gallo is also a winner, using fresh jalapenos. The portion, at roughly $12, is more than enough for one average stomach. Heated up after a Santa Barbara Bowl concert, the last taco tasted so good.Milpas is a hub of delicious Mexican food and the flavor of Santa Barbara's Eastside, and I'm happy that Los Agaves is just down the street from my housemate's workplace. If you're a tourist in town, this is the one place you absolutely must try!For Santa Barbara natives, Los Agaves is on Axxess! On your first visit, it's BOGO 50% off, and on every visit thereafter, you get a free soda.",5 star rating,Gwen W.

6/11/2017,"Bellevue, WA","We came at around 12:10pm. The parking lot was super small (maybe 10 spaces?) but there is street parking. You have to get pretty lucky like we did to find a spot on the street. It was relatively empty when we got our food and found a table, but minutes later at around 12:30pm, it got PACKED. It was so full that they ran out of chairs and had to bring out folded tables. I've never seen a lunch crowd swarm that quickly and out of nowhere so make sure you beat the rush or else you'll be waiting forever to order and get a seat!They have complimentary chips and there are a lot of different types of salsas next to the counter.Los Agaves Burrito: I love the sauce on top. The fish and shrimp were delicious and I loved the addition of the pineapple bits on top. I didn't feel as bloated as I usually do eating burritos. The rice and beans were on the side so you can decide how much to eat in every bite. Even the salad and the salad dressing were good!Chicken Molcajete: Very spicy and VERY hot so be careful! It comes in a pestle and mortar type bowl. It contains chorizo, chicken, and some crumbled cheese on top. The avocado on top was a great remedy to the heat that the dish brought. You can also use it to dip the chips in; that's delicious as well.It was a lot of food for the two of us but it was definitely delicious. If I am going back to SB, I will try my best to make a stop here!Random but the restroom was super nice too.",4 star rating,Brian F.

6/5/2017,"Saratoga, CA","Los Agaves was a suggested Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara and boy was this place packed! Los Agaves offers a wide selection of dishes and features an extensive salsa bar as well! The salsa bar was probably a highlight for me just because there was a wide variety of different salsas to try. The salsa bar also had cut limes and raw onions which were definitely pluses for me. I ordered the tacos del pastor which had 3 tacos with a combination of meats and guac on the side. Not a bad entrée as it definitely filled me up. I also tried their margarita which wasn't too bad. The salt was a bit too much for me in my opinion. Generally this place is great and the atmosphere is lively.Things to be aware here:1)Park along the residential area and not on the main road. It's easier to find parking on the smaller side streets. Most street parking have a parking limit so read the signs carefully!2)One must order first to receive a number and then wait to be seated. The staff here know how to deal with high traffic so be patient. Once you've ordered, talk to a staff member and he or she will do their best to accommodate your party.",4 star rating,Kenneth L.

9/23/2020,"Mammoth Lakes, CA","The food is way over priced and not even true Mexican food.  They had an issue with their card machine. Our cards kept denying.  We tried 4 of them.  Called our bank and said they could see the transactions and it was restaurants error.  They didn't bring my husbands drink, didn't bring a good box.  I would not revisit.  Go to authentic food place.",3 star rating,Jackie W.
6/2/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","My lower rating is because of an incident with the staff at Los Agaves on Milpas yesterday, which I explain below. The rest of my review follows that.While we were eating my boyfriend was showing me a yelp review.  The head waitress (I believe that's who she is) noticed our interaction. I'm guessing it was my laughter that caught her attention but there's no way of knowing. She leaned  and stretched her neck trying to read the screen of the phone, but not trying to hide that she was doing it. I put the phone down and continued our conversation. She then came over to confront us and ask if we were leaving Los Agaves bad reviews because ""she wanted to know about it."" We weren't discussing anything Los Agaves related but it is frankly not her concern what we were doing. I was very uncomfortable with her behavior, questions, and approach. I let her know that and asked her to allow us to eat in peace but she ignored me and repeated the same questions, this time facing my boyfriend. After he spoke with her she seemed satisfied enough to back off a bit but stayed nearby, no more than 5 feet away. I am at a loss as far as making sense of the situation as I have never encountered a situation like this. I found her behavior extremely unprofessional.*******As far as my other experiences:Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of Los Agaves food but I do like some plates here and there. I stick to the agaves salad, nachos, or ceviche. Sometimes they have a lime-cucumber-chia seed agua and I love that! I do not recommend their margarita, it was so bad it upset my stomach. I have been to all locations and service and quality of food is always consistent. I have noticed that they can be very sloppy with to-go orders, it would be better if they took the time to plate neatly. For example, I once ordered and agave salad with grilled shrimp but they topped the salad with the hot shrimp and closed the container, so the lettuce wilted by the time we got home. The setting of the restaurants is nice, they're usually bright and airy, very clean, but can get very noisy and crowded.",1 star rating,Adela C.

I like to try explore and try new places but this place is so tasty I'm tempted to try another location! We got the Gringa Al Pastor, Chile Relleno, and Agaves Burrito which probably could have fed at least four. Try the tomatillo sauce! I usually only like it with seafood but this green sauce is good on everything.The food is tasty, filling, and a bit heavy so come hungry. Servers are all friendly and nice. Not even mad that there was a wait and we had to share a table with strangers. Anyway to have a women's and a unisex restroom?

I was worried that the same would happen this visit but to my surprise, there was no line at all! I ordered the carne asada azteca and a blood orange margarita which was about $22. I thought this was  a great deal as the other Mexican restaurants charge much more for non authentic Mexican. With so many reviews, I want to keep it short and sweet. The food is great and the plate was huge! I was able to nibble on everything on the plate, but no way that I would be able to finish it. The blood orange was a tad too sweet but for $5 with 20% proof tequila, I can't complain. I would recommend it if the line wasn't long, but not sure I would stay and wait  if there was a line.Enjoy!",4 star rating,Jessica R.

Service was excellent: Various staffers were helpful, checked-in w/ us often to provide extra chips, napkins, clear our plates, check-in on our toddler, & were genuinely pleasant. They bused tables quickly & accommodated guests w/ extra chairs while there was what appeared to be construction going on in the other half of the restaurant. Probably to expand.

3/15/2018,"Fullerton, CA","This was an excellent place to dine at during our Thanksgiving Vacation in the Santa Barbara area.One of our friends recommended this spot based on yelp reviews. Our group of 10 were ""Buggie""ing near the beach all afternoon and were sort of famished by the time we arrived at this restaurant. Service:We were not sure how the setup worked. We must have arrived at peak time as there were at least 10 patrons in line ahead of us. There was not an empty table anywhere. I guess you order and then they set up a table for you? Half way through our wait, we noticed a larger group leave the restaurant. We politely queried an employee if we could reserve the just vacated space. The employee VERY happily obliged. He called another employee and between the both of them cleared out the soiled dishes, and set the table up for us within couple of minutes. *Claps* Each family in our group ordered individually, took our token and seated ourselves. Food was brought to us in the order that we had ordered. We waited at the maximum 5 Minute for the entire party to have something to get started. Employees in general were hustling like there was no tomorrow. Every staff member was enthusiastic to be there, and was assisting any questions patrons might throw at them. Atmosphere:The place was bumbling with activity. I had a cafe kind of a vibe until I placed my order and sat down. From that moment on to the time we left, it felt like an authentic dine in Mexican restaurant. There is a lot of seating inside. It is good for small as well as large groups. Parking was a tad bit difficult as their own lot is rather small. However, there is plenty of parking on the street. Food: I ordered a Mole Enchilada (~$13), Side of Steak (~$6) and a Horchata ($3). Mrs ordered a 2 item combo with Chile Relleno, Grilled Chicken Taco and 2 portions of Rice (~$13)  Mole was delicious. Horchata was very smooth. Steak was prepared well with spices and was not chewy at all. It was good quality meat. The Grilled Chicken Taco was VERY good. Ian had a good time devouring it in record time.  This is a must try restaurant for all you tourists visiting the SB area!",5 star rating,Krishna C.

I liked that you went up and ordered and then sat down because it gave me a chance to spy on everyone else's food and determine what I wanted to order. The portions are huge but this place is NOT cheap. I think we spent close to $50 for just two people. I got the steak quesadilla and my husband got the fish tacos. They were amazing. They have a big selection of salsa that you can get to go with your food/chips. They definitely rush you out so this is not the place for a relaxed, extended meal.

1/1/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Stopped in here for lunch during a day trip to SB. We chose this place based on the reviews, and specifically for the mention of the queso fundido. We enjoyed it, but I understand why the reviews are mixed. Here's what you need to know before going:The food IS great; very flavorful and unique and not just a standard Mexican food spot. My boyfriend called everything ""excellent"" and he's not often free with praise for restaurants. I was very happy with both tacos i ordered, and it is worth noting they are a substantial size. When another reviewer said the tacos were art, I thought that meant they'll be tasty but the size of a half dollar. Not so! They were very nice sized and i almost regretted ordering two since they were so filling. The queso fundido was not quite what we were expecting and they were out of chorizo for it, but it was definitely a take on queso I hadn't experienced before. Service was a little wonky, so I get where some of the previously aired frustrations are coming from. We got 2 items almost right away, but then the rest was very staggered as they realized they were missing ingredients for some of the order, and entirely forgot about my 2nd taco until I brought it up. I will say all staff was very friendly and apologetic and the issues were resolved pretty fast. We were lucky to have found seating. That seems like it can be tricky and there are always other customers hovering waiting to take your seats. As such, maybe not the most relaxing dining but you just have to decide to take your time and enjoy your food, and kind of roll with the potential chaos. Again, everyone on staff was very helpful and nice. Maybe this place just needs a bigger space.",4 star rating,Ashley L.

It's served with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. This was ENORMOUS. ENORMOUS. ENORMOUS. This appetizer could literally feed four hungry college students. You can't really mess up on nachos unless you skimp out on the toppings, but it was good here.-agaves burrito ($13.50): halibut + shrimp, roasted red peppers, onions, Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce + guac topped with chipotle sauce served with a side of rice and beans. And to my recollection, there was rice in the burrito. Eh, the first few bites where good, but theeeeeennn it was too much.

It's our favorite Mexican restaurant hands down, and they have been consistently delicious for many years. Our favorite things are the Los Agaves Enchiladas and Los Agaves Burrito. Both come with tasty shrimp and halibut, cheese, topped with a creamy and heavenly chipotle sauce. I'd drink that sauce! We also looove their freshly made salsas and chips! And they have salsa to go containers so you can take some home! And don't forget their Mexican sodas!Welcome to your new favorite Mexican place. Los Agaves. The best.",5 star rating,Kelsey C.

6/11/2019,"New York, NY","I was excited to try this top rated place in SB however I was wholly underwhelmed for the price we paid. There was just nothing distinctive about the flavors - I couldn't really put a finger on what it was missing, maybe salt or spices? It was just ""fresh"" but otherwise not that tasty or memorable. However, I did enjoy the salsa bar (regular and green sauces were the best). Presentation was great, food was okay, and service was extremely mediocre (they kept asking what our order was even tho we had a man order number on our table and waiters kept bumping into me and were not nice at all about it). Ordering also felt a bit like being at Chipotle - you get in a long line, then are rushed to order, they just swipe your credit card without a word, and you struggle try to find an open table. If I had to describe this place, I would say it was ""good"" - not worth going out of your way for.",3 star rating,Amanda L.

9/3/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Personally didn't think this place was anything to rave about but my girlfriend liked it. I ordered the Tacos Del Mar and I felt salty about it because I thought they were going to be classic beer battered fish tacos. Instead, the fish was pan seared and had some hot steamed cabbage on top that was not tasty. The tacos came with rice and salad and I liked both of those better than the tacos. My girlfriend ordered the tostada salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The true highlight of this place was the complementary chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar that is self-serve. If I was rating this place on chips and salsa alone, it would be 5 stars honestly.",3 star rating,J K.

8/25/2019,"Redondo Beach, CA","I went here because it was recommended to me but I was not very impressed. To be fair I only ordered a drink and an appetizer but because I wasn't wowed with either, I won't go back. I love micheladas and theirs was nothing special. It didn't have the zing in it that I expect. I also ordered the chicken taquitos appetizer that comes with lettuce, pico de Gallo, sour cream and guacamole. It had all the makings of being a delectable dish but fell completely flat. It's a minimal service establishment. You get in line to order and pay and the food is delivered to you. There's an help yourself salsa bar. Try for yourself, but I won't go back.",3 star rating,Theresita M.
3/27/2019,"Nipomo, CA","Ate here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon. Very popular as the line was almost out the door (and all tables were occupied). While I did find the dining rooms a bit cramped, it didn't seem to prevent patrons from filling up every available seat and enjoying their meal. The food is pricey for a Mexican restaurant, but that may largely have to do with the location (Santa Barbara CA is expensive). They start you off with warm tortilla chips and an unlimited variety of salads and sauces to choose from. For my meal, I picked the Enchiladas Suizas, which was loaded with green chili verde sauce and Swiss cheese. Beans in a taco shell and rice comes with the entree. Everything was delicious, and I especially liked how much chicken they loaded into the enchiladas. The spicy green sauce didn't have much spice at all (I wanted spicy). I give this place a 4-star because the chips, salsa variety, and food was good. The lack of much elbow room and the high pricing was a deterrent for me.",4 star rating,Neville S.

I always knew this was one of the best places in town to get food, but now I'm thinking it's gotta be in the top 3 (if not number 1!)One of the best things about it (in my opinion) is the variety you get. You can try amazing new dishes and never get bored. And if you like to get the same thing every time, the quality is very consistent. I love the salsa bar, and if you've never tried it, I highly suggest the chipotle salsa. All in all, this is just a great local restaurant, and I think it has earned it's spot in the top restaurants of SB. Check it out for sure!",5 star rating,Mak H.
2/15/2018,"San Diego, CA","Definitely over-hyped, but I like the creativity and attempt at authentic Mexican food.This is NOT Tex-Mex so don't expect to find the best California burrito or carne asada fries. Los Agaves serves top quality cultural dishes that offer a huge variety of flavors and ingredients.But, I just wasn't into it. My wife and I used our axxess card to try this place out so it wasn't too expensive. However, the normal prices are diefinitely more than your average Mexican restaurant. I was told that the food would taste amazing. But I found the otherwise well presented food to taste pretty underwhelming and very very salty. It was just a mish-mash of quality ingredients.Great selection of Salsa though! They also give you free chips and salsa to start off your appetite.",3 star rating,Jon C.
6/26/2016,"Newport Beach, CA","I really liked this place!Los Agaves exceeded my expectations. You need to browse the yelp photos or the menu before coming. When you walk in, you go straight to the register and order. There is also a large board with daily specials. If you are not familiar with the menu, you need to take a seat and figure out what you want. After ordering, you are given a number. You pick your salsas from the salsa bar (I tried all of them!) and the lady will bring your chips. They carry out your food to you table for you. They also refill you chips.~Tampiquena-4.5 Stars!Steak with red enchilada, taquito, pinto beans, yellow peppers, avocado and nachos!!This was a solid dish and the food, including the steak, was excellent. This dish also comes with warm tortillas. I definitely would order this dish again.~Nachos-4 Stars!This was probably the largest serving I have seen at any restaurant. It is a huge portion of chips, sour cream, guacamole and pinto beans AND cheese... lots of cheese. The little one loved this and was surprised how large it was. This is a great dish for kids or for sharing,~Horchata-AOK. It was a bit watery and a bit too sweet for my tastes.The restaurant is large with a small parking lot in the back. The service is AOK and prices are ridiculously reasonable. Overall, I am a fan and then some. I would totally eat here again on my next trip to Santa Barbara!",4 star rating,Nick H.

Just because he had seen me doing doordash, are we not allowed to order food from restaurants we pick up for other customers? Well for this guy i think we are not allowed, i gave him my friends name, his number and even his complete order. He could have told me we need him to come and pick up. But instead he decided to act like he was looking for my order, and he wasnt after like 8-10 mins he asked me why dont you ask who placed the order to cone to pick up. He could have said that aince the beginning instead of acting all stupid pretending to look for my order when it was there. When my friend pick it up he even told him, we have to be careful because orders are bein stolen, cmon are you not following your online orders directions? You are supposed to see drivers orders and ask them to hit picked up"" so they dont get stolen you dummy.

The great service with smiles and accommodating staff make you feel like a guest more than a customer. The food,  with authentic sauces and flavors, is completely satisfying and delicious. The one problem is you will want to keep eating even when you're full. It's on a corner and doesn't seem like it's special from the outside. But that makes the dining experience here even better. You walk in thinking it will be basic, but you will soon realize it is nothing short of fantastic. Enjoy!(I had the Enchiladas Guadalajara- with green salsa. So good!)",5 star rating,Yvette A.

7/18/2016,"Long Beach, CA","Holy Guacamole this place is the shiznitz! My girlfriend and I went here cause we like to try good eats in our PCH road trip. This place is amazingly great! The ambiance is great and lively. People that serves us are always smiling and friendly; it is really a positive restaurant to dine in. You might be wondering why cause of course, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants all over the area. The reason is cause of their unique sauces.They serve a complimentary basket of chips whenever you decided to dine in, so I tasted their salsas first. They have a guacamoleto, which is a better version of El Pollo Locos green avocado salsa. cause you can actually taste the avocado in it. They have a regular salsa chips as well, which tasted like a marinara blend found in Italian cuisine and it is unique/ creative/ taste so good. My girlfriend ordered their Agaves burrito, which is a seafood burrito consist of shrimp and fish. Their secret salsa sauce is smothered in the burrito. It is served with salad as well. I tasted it and I wanted to just grab it from her; that's how good this burrito is!  I, on the other hand, ordered their steak/ seafood sopes bowl; the best Mexican soup I ever had. The bowl is like a wizard just crafted this for me; the bowl looks like a cauldron of goodness. They serve it with corn tortilla, too. The steak inside the soup is melt in your mouth tender and the seafood part is not overwhelmingly fishy. The red sauce in it is addictively great! It has a spicy kick into it, but I still keep on eating it. I don't like spicy food, but surprisingly I would eat this in a heartbeat. If only I lived nearby, I would eat here at least ones a week cause it's amazingly good.Overall, I will definitely go here again when given a chance :)",5 star rating,Adrian A.

To our surprise, the line was out the door! I guess we shouldn't have been THAT surprised as it was a holiday weekend. We waited probably about 30 minutes in line, which wasn't too bad considering how busy it was. My only complaint is that the flow of the restaurant didn't make much sense as the servers had to cut through the giant line of people to get the food out to the customers. Other than that, the service was extremely speedy. They found us a table for 7 people immediately after we ordered. All of our dishes came out piping hot and everything was delicious. I had the two item combo with 2 crispy tacos and the beef was so tasty and well marinated. My bf had the burrito mojado and said it was amazing. All of our plates were wiped clean!

We tried to come one night and the line was out the door so we came back the next night around 5PM to beat the rush and the line was still long but it dispersed quickly. I thought it would be a sit down meal with a server but you order at a counter and are given a number and people bring the food out to you as it's ready.The place didn't seem super clean, maybe because of all the foot traffic throughout the day, and there were only two bathrooms inside but one was out of order. There was a sign that said there were portable bathrooms outside for patrons to use which I actually should have tried because some lady was in the bathroom for, no lie, 20 minutes...I don't even want to know what that was about.Once we got the food, I wasn't that impressed to be honest.

Halibut and shrimps with salsa and lettuce (no onions or cheese for me) wrapped into a humongous burritos topped with spicy red sauce! Yes, you must eat a knife and fork! Every bite you bite into, you find large chunks of halibut or whole shrimp! They don't skimp on the shrimp! The sauce was spicy and thick and creamy. Yum! Oh, the side salad was also delicious! The yogurt dressing was so refreshing with the mini orange and cranberries. Loved it! Mojado Burrito: Wet burrito with steak: another amazing burrito! The steak was truly a steak! All the ingredients that went into the burrito was so fresh! The red sauce was not spicy but definitely added flavor to the burrito. This burrito is like a steak fajitas all wrapped up nicely for me! Again, fork and knife required. Loved! The salsa bar was plentiful! You got mild to spicy salsas! Onions, cilantro, and lime to add to your dishes. All orders come with a basket of chips! Yes, please!Horchata: sooo good! Tastes so...authentic? Yes yes, if I must say so. Hibiscus juice: too sweet. I'd skip it and get a Mexican soda instead!This is a quick sit down type of eatery. You order then find a table to sit. Don't be intimidated by the number of people in line or already sitting. There are plenty of spaces for everyone.

1/12/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Came here twice in 2 days just to make sure we had a chance to try everything. Tried the seafood enchilada, the tacos al pastor, the guacamole, and the camarones guajillo. The seafood enchilada was one of the best I've ever had - the tangy citrus salsa balanced the seafood perfectly. The fish along with the seafood gave it a nice heft and meatiness. I'd eat this all day, every day if I could. The tacos al pastor came with a good amount of meat, which was nice, but I found it a little too salty and a a little too sweet/one dimensional. The camarones guajillo was just okay. Great smoky flavor and the shrimp were large and fresh, but compared to the seafood enchilada, this couldn't compare. Overall, get the seafood enchilada, that alone is worth the trip.",5 star rating,Jeff D.

This is such a unique dish with deep, delicious flavors. The steak picado was also really good. It wasn't saucy like most steak picados that I've had in the past but it had great flavor and tons of veggies. On our last visit we started with the Los Agaves salad which was loaded with tomatoes, mandarin oranges, mango, avocado, and cranberries. I really like this salad as well but didn't thought the dressing was too sweet so I was happy we requested it on the side. The salad didn't really need dressing.

Lota of different choices for the salsa.Then, as if by magic, a worker came by and replaced our empty basket of chips as we finished it.Afterwards came the burritos. The burritos were AMAZING. We had the Agaves Burrito and the Burrito Mojado (Chicken). They were SOOOOOO good.Throughout the eating experience, the service was absolutely amazing.And just from watching, you can tell the workers love their job. You can tell the General Manager is a man who loves his job and treats his workers well.I wish I had more to tip.You guys won 3 loyal customers today.",5 star rating,Yong J.

The owner was walking around chatting with guests and making sure everyone was happy with their food.  We tried the carne asada sopes and they were freshly made and had a ton of meat.  Food was so good we came back for dinner and and had the flautas  which were cripsy and filled with meat. My husband had the mole enchiladas. Their portions are very generous and prices are reasonable,",5 star rating,Lorena R.

I was expecting something more sweet. I'm creole so we like our tea sweet but it was very bland. I didn't knock off a star because customer service. Marisol was an active worker (just like the others) cleaning, making sure customers were satisfied, attentive, kind and helpfulCleanliness: 10/10 restroom smelled great!

2/22/2016,"Alhambra, CA","Compared to Mexican food in Los Angeles, over-rated and over-priced, but overall okay.I got the Homemade Sopes with Chicken, Rice, and Beans.  Everything tasted good, but I couldn't help but to think I could have gotten better tasting Sopes at King Taco for $5 for two (without the rice and beans).  The rice was really really good, though.  My hubby and I thought it was the best Mexican Rice we've tried.My hubby got the Steak Burrito Mojado (wet burrito) with rice.  He liked it.  I tried a bite.  The steak had a charred taste to it.  I suppose that is a good thing to a lot of people, but I just wasn't in the mood for it.  Overall the salsa bar disappointed me.  There was a large selection but none of the salsas were great.  They complimented the complimentary chips well, but they didn't really go with my food.Also, I'm pregnant, and I'm not supposed to have queso fresco or queso blanco because it can harm the baby if it's unpasteurized.  I was surprised to find it all over all my food items because it wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I didn't specify that I couldn't have it to the cashier, so I suppose it's partially my fault, but I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that sprinkled queso on everything without stating it on the menu, so I didn't think to ask.",3 star rating,Karen K.
2/23/2016,"Murrieta, CA","Second time trying this out. I remember not liking it much the first time too and I should of wrote a review then to avoid coming back.You will have to wait in a long line that flows outside the door usually. It moves fairly quickly. The menu has a large variety as well as some specials posted on the board above the registers. The prices seem high to me but for the way the food is displayed and freshness it makes sense I suppose. After ordering, the task of finding a seat takes place. This place isn't small but it can still be hard to find a seat due to the amount of people that frequent it.  The staff are fairly good at cleaning the tables quickly and moving people around to accommodate party sizes better.  I tried the potato tacos this time. The rice and beans served on the side were great. I wish I had got more beans actually. They serve them in a little tostada shell. The potato tacos were probably the worst I've had. The potato's were bland and had random green chilies inside them which I hate and would not have ordered if I knew that. The taco was crisp but to the point where it kept falling apart. I was so disappointed because I couldn't even finish them. My husband tried as well but gave up.  He did enjoy his steak dish very much though. The Horchata here is made fresh and it has a ton of cinnamon. I enjoy that.",2 star rating,Charita A.
1/10/2018,"Fresno, CA","Very fresh mexican food, you order sit down and its brought to you in a timely fashion. Wasn't to packed when we got there so it was easy to find a seat, but I am sure this place does get quite busy on the weekends and maybe later in the evening. Fish burrito was awesome, loved the mixture of everything inside though i wish there was a little less sauce not that it didn't taste good because it did but it took a little to much away from freshness of the fish, shrimp and the heart of the burrito. Horchata was delicious also!",3 star rating,Anthony T.

I can't believe how great this place is and only wished that we got here earlier because we didn't get to try their rice or horchata because they ran out at 6pm, but we did order the Agave Enchiladas and Enchiladas Guadalajara and it was delicious. They did substitute the rice for salad that had pineapple, cranberry, and mandarin oranges! Soooooo good!Only wish that we got to try the rice because the guy behind us in line immediately left when he found out the ran out of rice and horchata. LOL. It must be that good.

11/27/2018,"San Luis Obispo, CA","I first ate at Los Agaves in 2010, back when the Milpas restaurant was the only location, and I have been a loyal customer ever since. We're talking 1+ times every week, almost without fail. The service is quick, even in busy times, and the flavors can't be beat. I am personally a big fan of the salsa bar at the Milpas restaurant, which sadly doesn't exist at some of the other locations (e.g., Westlake Village). My favorites dishes include the Baja Tacos (a special, so not always available) and the Los Agaves salad (the mango dressing is out of this world). But really, everything I have ordered has been amazing. Whenever I am asked to recommend places to eat in Santa Barbara, Los Agaves is at the top of the list.",5 star rating,Lizzy M.

11/4/2019,"San Francisco, CA","I stopped here on a road trip from Malibu to SF. PROS- Parking was easily located behind the restaurant. - The menu was pretty vast, you order then find a table. CONS - the food was just okay, not sure it was worth the wait and hassle of finding a table to sit at - seating should be controlled by the staffLunch time and pretty packed, the staff was helpful in finding us a table while we waited for the food however they did nothing about people holding empty tables for others who hadn't even ordered yet. I watched four large tables being held by 2 children and 1 adult while the rest of their party waited at the end of a very long and slow line, while those who had already ordered and we're looking for a table we're not able to be seated.

11/25/2019,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","Los Agaves is well-known with the locals, as well as with tourists. Why, I have no idea? Mostly hype, you expect more, and are quickly disappointed. It is located off the tourist path on Milpas. The food is pricey for a casual dining experience, and the food is mediocre at best. The service is probably the worst in Santa Barbara. I had to hunt down my server for everything...even the bill! Even then, I had to wait by the front cashier for about 10 minutes to get the bill, and the server was rude. You have plenty of other choices for Mexican food in Santa Barbara , you would be better off eating somewhere else. I would have given Los Agaves ZERO STARS, but it is not an option.",1 star rating,Joe B.

Everyone working here was super attentive,  very friendly and just overall fantastic!!! They have a great salsa bar!  The decor of the restaurant was nice, they only have 1 bathroom for men and women and their bathroom was very clean. The parking though isnt that great they have a small lot luckily we found a spot or else you have to park on the street. They are right on the corner you can't miss them. The shrimp diablo and the chicken fajitas were good. I really enjoyed their rice I actually loved their rice, very soft and very flavorful. The fajitas were good but could have been a little more flavorful but overall good especially when you mix it with the sour cream, lettuce, guacamole and tomatoes it comes nicely eith the tortillas.I definitely would come back and try their other stuff on the menu. The service though was just amazing. I was really impressed on how great they were. Definitely would recommend this spot!",4 star rating,Rashmi V.
6/3/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Came this restaurant a couple days ago when I was in Santa Barbara and thought it was good but not great. It definitely was on the pricier side for Mexican food, because I'm sure a lot of us know it be ""cheap"" food, but it was well worth it. I got the agave enchiladas and every bite included shrimp and halibut. The sauce on top was also good itself, but it my opinion got overpowered by flavors of the seafood.

9/11/2015,"Long Beach, CA","BEST SALSA EVER!Hours before dinner, we were wine bar hopping around Santa Barbara and the Meateater BF's friend kept talking about how delicious the salsa at Los Agaves is. Like the kind of delicious that would make you want to buy buckets of this amazing stuff. I was curious but skeptical. Can salsa really be that good? Um, yeah...it can! He hyped it up...A LOT and it STILL lived up to the hype!What I didn't expect was the variety. So when I got to the salsa bar, I asked him ""which one is the best one?"" and he said ""get all of them!"" Well shoot, here we go! bit.ly/1Lodg67My favorites were the chipotle one, the avocado salsa, the salsa verde, and the salsa negra. Habañero salsa was delicious too but WOO its spicy! :DAs much as I would love to say that we came here just for the salsa, we also ordered dinner entrées. I inquired about the Garden Burrito to find out if the rice is cooked in chicken stock and the gal behind the counter confirmed that it was. But then she took the extra initiative to inform me that the beans they typically serve are not vegan either but they do have vegan-friendly beans. She made sure that it was used in my burrito. Then offered me extra beans on the side in lieu of the rice. So helpful! I appreciate it when employees go above and beyond :) We also nixed all the dairy ingredients. This burrito was HUGE!!! Filled with grilled zucchini, green and red bell peppers and beans. It also had lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo on the side. bit.ly/1KJ9euNTrust me when I say that I covered every bite with so much delicious salsa!

I did a quick yelp search and stubbled upon this GEM with outstanding reviews. This place was perfect in every sense. First of all, our food was phenomenal. Fresh, delicious, and full of flavor. Second, I love the idea of choosing your seats when at a restaurant... we had a stroller and made it work so well!

From the complimentary chips and salsa to the Seafood Enchiladas we had, the food was high quality, amazing flavors and generous portions. Again, fresh is the key theme throughout their menu. Where they complete fall short is the atrocious service by the staff who have absolutely no understanding of the concepts of customer, customer experience, or customer service. From cutting you off when crossing your path to bringing the to go boxes you asked for and dropping it off at the next table, this crew pays absolutely no attention you. We waited 15 minutes for a basket of chips while they dropped chips off at tables next to us that came after us. When we asked for chips the response was ""we are out of chip baskets, it will only be 5 minutes"". As busy as you are, here is a concept: buy more chip baskets!!!

8/7/2015,"San Ramon, CA",A good place for Mexican food. Taste was great and flavor full. Price is little on the high side for a drink and a main course it costed $20 for one person. The food was authentic but served western style. This is probably the first place I was served enchiladas with rice and salad. Usually the sides would be pinto beans or retried beans with rice but here it was salad. The dressing used in the salad was bomb. It was amazing. The halibut & shrimp with peppers and onion filled enchiladas with chipotle sauce topping was perfect. The food was fresh and hot. The spice level was moderate and wasn't like fire. This allowed for the taste buds to realize other taste in the food. The salsa bar was of wide choices and freshly made. Will visit this place again. Why 4 stars instead of 5 the reason is it is bit pricy.,4 star rating,Suresh D.

I can see why it's popular, it's a hole in the wall place, very authentic, and a really cool ambience. Price is really good, but portion sizes not not too grand. I had to finish my wife's food to get semi full. Quality is good, you can tell their ingredients are superb. For this they get 3 stars...Service is average, they're not the most respectful of people; my wife went to sit down as I was ordering, she was tired after walking all morning. They made her get up since we had not put in our order yet... Seriously! They didn't heck in on us after the food was delivered, one of the meals was incorrectly delivered and the waiter spoke no English so I had to point to the menu to tell him what our other meal was... Everything is self service, drinks, sides, napkins... We even wiped down our own table when we sat down!! The best way to describe this place is a better quality Rubios!!

6/12/2017,"Anaheim, CA","First things first... chips and salsa bar here is ON POINT!While I wasn't wild about my dish--it was the wet burrito with carne asada; it comes with guacamole, sour cream and salsa and a side of their very tasty rice, I feel like overall, people were pleased with their dishes. I would recommend getting the chile nortenos--they were stuffed chilis with cheese and shrimp. The seafood enchiladas (I forgot what's in it exactly) is delicious--and the sauce they drizzle on top is absolutely delicious (the slightly peach colored one). There are so many things on the menu that there is definitely something for everyone.Service could be improved, one of the steaks was well beyond cooked for a medium rare, they messed up my drink order and forgot to ring up another one. Aside from that, it was an overall good experience.",4 star rating,James L.
9/28/2019,"Beaumont, CA",I love coming here every time I pass by Santa Barbara. Came in on a Wednesday around 1:00 and I wasn't too hungry so I tried just the chili relleno. I thought it was pretty good but not hot enough. Weird. Then I tried my husband's burrito and it was good but also a bit on the cold side. The flavors were wonderful as always but the temperature off on both. On our return trip we decided to stop in again (3days later) and this time I was starving! My hubby ordered his usual burrito and I got the Agave burrito with shrimp and fish. Cold again. This burrito has always been my favorite. I love the sauce and chunks of shrimp but there was so much cold guacamole that the whole burrito was cold. My husband's burrito was better. I hope it was just a fluke. I still gave 4 stars for flavors and service. I don't want to give up on this place so we'll be back but I hope I get a hot meal.,4 star rating,Jenna S.

9/21/2015,"West Covina, CA","Get in line for some great Mexican authenticity. There's always a line every dinner time here. And why not their food demands the caliber of taste you're asking for. Great mole, great molcajete, more than enough nachos, grande burritos, chile verde are among the best here. But the list goes on. It's not a sit down order kind of restaurant but the inside is just with authentic Mexican ambiance. They have enough great choice of beer just wish their agave margaritas can come in pitchers order. Great tasting indeed but small glass it comes in. Friendly cashiers, overall staff seems always in a rush to keep up with serving food fast enough to get you out for patrons waiting always to get and find seating after order. If you don't mind the standing while scoping for the next available table. Parking in the back is pretty small so street parking is a way to go.Would definitely recommend food if you're hungry as serving is big portions!!",4 star rating,Brenda L.
9/26/2017,"Arroyo Grande, CA",Wow. We stopped here thanks to Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we did. The food was fantastic! Everything tastes fresh and made to order. The salsa bar was amazing and so was the tropical iced tea. I ordered shrimp tacos with mango salsa and if I hadn't been so full I would have immediately ordered and eaten the same exact thing over again. My husband had a chili rellano that was incredible. You know a Mexican restaurant is going to be good when their rice and beans are good and Los Agave's were! The service was courteous and efficient; I like that when ordering at a counter. The restaurant was clean even when it was packed! We will definitely be back next time we are in Santa Barbara.,5 star rating,Jessica O.

10/6/2018,"Chicago, IL","Not that this place needs another five star review, but had to leave one after having one of the best dishes I've had at least in the past year. This place was so good, we came here twice on our trip. First time had the enchiladas and they were very good. The real star of the show though is the sea and earth molcajete. Fish, shrimp, steak, chorizo, chicken in the most delicious bubbling sauce, with cheese, peppers, onions, and cactus. You will not regret getting this. Everyone at the table will envy your order. Also don't miss out on the guacamole and fresh salsa bar.My only complaint is the mango margaritas that are made with wine and are too thick for my liking.",5 star rating,Kristin M.

Yuk! Maybe it needs a filter?  Needs something.Parking lot in the back accommodates approx. 8 cars and tight spaces!  Door ding, bumper crash territory!We did not like that when we asked the order clerk to substitute the guacamole for some beans same size, he said he can't do it.  We don't like guacamole and trade it for more rice or beans in most Mexican restaurants--Guac cost more $$ so they do it.  Like a government bureaucracy he told us that they don't allow us to do that here.  It's against policy.   I need to bring in a lobbyist next time I come here--someone from the Bean coalition.",4 star rating,David D.

6/12/2019,"San Jose, CA","We drove all the way here after seeing this highly rated restaurant on yelp. The place was packed and there was a long line to order and to find a table. We asked the waitress while we were in line about vegetarian options and she handed us the vegetarian menu and told us that the rice in all of the dishes is cooked in chicken broth and that we could only get the black beans as the pinto also had chicken broth. We were not sure why the vegetarian menu still said rice? Anyway, we waited in line and ironically the man in front of us also asked for vegetarian food at the counter and we over heard the waitress telling him that all the enchilada sauces and salsa's also are cooked in meat? We weren't sure what to make of this situation so we ended up leaving the line and going to another restaurant because we did not want to risk it. It would be great if the vegetarian menu actually reflected the vegetarian items (i.e. no chicken broth, lard, etc) so vegetarians can feel comfortable eating at this restaurant. There was a lot of contradictory things that were being said by the waitresses vs. the items listed on the menu. Hope they can correct for future vegetarian clientele.",1 star rating,Minati D.
12/28/2018,"Anaheim, CA","Not exactly sure what the rave reviews are all about. Maybe I got the wrong thing? The enchiladas suizas were ok. The organized chaos is a little frustrating with ordering at the counter and then scrambling to find a table. Just make it a true sit down restaurant. Either way, decent Mexican food if you want to brave the crowds. But I think 4.5 stars over 3k reviews is a bit high.",3 star rating,Steve W.
8/24/2019,"Oxnard, CA","When we visit Santa Barbara this is by far the best place to go for Mexican food. A nice location with adequate parking. The facility is light, bright and colorfully decorated. The furnishings are nice quality. The restaurant is semi self serve. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Don't let the long line scare you. The line moves pretty quickly and it's worth the wait. The food is sooooo .... good. Add some home made salsas (they have nice variety), light and tasty tortilla chips, beer on tap and mixed drinks and ""woo-hoo"" you will walk out with a full tummy and a smile on your face!",5 star rating,Mike B.

9/3/2017,"Cincinnati, OH","Whlle vacationing in Santa Barbara, a friend recommended Los Agaves. It's not in the heart of town, so I'm very glad she tipped us off to it or we might not have found it. You order at the counter and staff brings your food to the table. I grew up in Los Angeles, where there's Mexican food on nearly every corner, and there were items I'd never seen before on this menu. I went for the Molcajetes, a specialty of the house, and it was wild. Served in a tripod bowl made seemingly of volcano rock, it bubbled throughout the entire meal and was delicious. There was something for everyone in the family, including a pescatarian and vegetarian. The family enjoyed their tacos and enchiladas. The margaritas were fresh and different. They are made with cactus wine instead of tequila. The place was packed and the atmosphere was buzzy. I hope I'll get to go again!",4 star rating,Nanette B.

I thought I knew what I was going to order before walking in, but a friendly gentleman at the counter suggested some of their best sellers so I went with what they recommended, which was a fish and shrimp enchilada covered in the most delectable sauce. I'm so glad I went with his suggestion because it was perfect. It came with a side salad and some rice, I believe. They also have an amazing salsa bar on the side where you can get all different types of salsa ranging from mild to hot. I also got myself a passion fruit iced tea which was unsweetened but the flavor was so good that I didn't need any sugar. The service was very friendly and the space was clean and cozy. I would definitely come here again and recommend it to anyone.",5 star rating,Christine P.
2/8/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","My rating is for their food. The food is amazing and the portions are large. I've tried a few items but I highly recommend their garden burrito! Also, they have amazing varieties of Salsa. Food gets prepared pretty quickly but lines can be quite long during peak lunch and dinner time. I usually call and order ahead of time so that it's ready when I get there (usually only takes 15-20 mins for them to prepare). Great ambiance and probably one of the best restaurants in town.The servers that work there are quick, attentive and efficient.",5 star rating,Rushiraj N.

The flavor were perfect and the portions are very generous. Oh yeah.. the rice was SO good. I normally don't eat too much of the rice but it was so well seasoned. It was just perfect! The sauce bar also had a great selection! The agave margarita was good too :) Service: I don't mind the idea of ordering at the counter and then finding a seat.

9/7/2019,"Burbank, CA",This quickly became my favorite Mexican restaurant. My wife and I were in town on vacation and decided to stop after reading positive reviews. We loved it so much that we came back the following night. Both nights we had the steak fajitas burrito and chicken fajitas burrito. It was a generous portion for an excellent price. The meat was tender and the vegetables were fresh. One of the biggest perks is the chips and salsa bar. The manager and entire staff were exceptional.,5 star rating,Mike K.

Their horchata was so good and my boyfriend's lengua with salsa verde was the most tender lengua ever. My favorite though, was my dish - the Agaves enchiladas. The sauce was to die for and the bits of mango gave it a delicate sweet and savory taste. Every bite of every dish I had was bomb.

It's popular for good reasons!The food is cooked with love and lots of flavor! Did I mention the huge portions already? We could have easily shared one meal but went overboard and ordered way too much food. The hard potato taco was packed with flavor and the chile relleno filled with Monterey jack cheese and topped with salsa roja, sour cream and queso fresco was outstanding. And then the Plato Placero de Arrachera which is a fun way to make your own tacos came with chopped tender steak, melted cheese, grilled chorizo & nopal along with pinto beans and guacamole. So much food! But everything was on the money. We also had agave and blood orange margaritas and both were great. You order your food first, then grab your drinks, sauces and sides. Then you'll be seated by one of the many employees who are working non-stop to make sure everything keeps moving. This place is a well oiled machine!",4 star rating,Ania K.
9/28/2019,"Corona, CA","The bad far outweighed the good here.  Let's start with what was good...Employees were very friendly.Guacamole was amazing.The salmon was pretty good as well.The BAD...You order at the counter like a fast food restaurant but the meals are just as expensive as any sit down restaurant you go to.  If you want something else you have to get back in line which of course you don't want to do while in the middle of a meal.The tables were crowded too close together so we had other patrons bumping into our chairs when they try to sit down or get up. Servers dropping food off knocking into our table as they walked by.There were four of us and all four entrées came at completely different times. My wife's meal which I think they actually forgot to make until we complained arrived a good 20 minutes after all the other food.Lots of potential here with this place doesn't know what it wants to be, a nice restaurant or a fast food joint.",2 star rating,Paul M.
8/27/2018,"Arleta, CA","Pros: Excellent food!  Had the Vallarta Salad with Stead and the Baja Shrimp tacos.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and so were all the components that made that salad; the mango, jicama, cucumber, so refreshing!   The baja tacos were delicious as well...homemade tortilla! three yummy battered super hot (as in warm) shrimp topped with spicy coleslaw... I could have done with a lil less slaw but regardless it was delicious. The sides that came with the tacos... rice OMG what a delicious rice, so puffy!  The salad was good as well.Cons:Thankfully my friend were sharing the salad and the baja tacos, had we not, one of us would have had to wait for their food for an additional 20 minutes, I'm  sure there was a flaw there, as other order were coming out faster than ours even if the clients showed up after us.  Again, we had a chance to finish our salad, but I wanted to take a bite of each.  The agave wine maragritas: They were a bit salty, almost too salty to drink.  I wonder if this is always the case, because if it wouldn't have been for the saltiness it would have been super amazing. Regardless the cons, the food was amazing and I will def come back to eat here again!",5 star rating,A M.

For almost every plate, the beans come in a textured, flaky shell, and most of their dishes include a pepper filled with melted cheese, which is outstanding. Their variety of salsas from the bar are also some of the best I've had. The only thing that some may not like is that you have to wait in line to order. Servers bring food to your table and will typically get you whatever else you need, though. Overall, one of my favorite restaurants I've tried in SB. 5 stars.",5 star rating,Jeremy B.
1/27/2017,"Northridge, CA","I went to school at UCSB and this is the first time I have ever heard of this place. I consider that a travesty and blame my roommates for continuously dragging me to Jack in the Box instead for the 2 tacos for .99 value menu and the occasional jalepeno poppers. But I digress. I had the Molcajetes (Sea and Earth) which was the first time ever trying it. Its almost like a soup. A really thick and somewhat spicy soup. But then they give you tortillas. Am I supposed to make it into a soupy burrito? Or make my soup in the a burritoy soup. Nonetheless, it actually tasted better the day after. Cold. Or mixed into an omlette. My girlfriend ordered the Agaves Burrito which was pretty much the most awesome burrito I've eaten. Thank you for reading my review!",5 star rating,Mike K.

8/19/2017,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",Had to be one of the  top Mexican joints I've ever been to. The shrimp tacos are so bomb and I think it's because those tortillas are freshly homemade. Even the Spanish rice impressed me. So fluffy and packed with flavor that your mouth just asks for more. The side salad that accompanies the dish was a fruity mango salad and even that was great!My wife had the chile rellenos and it was delicious and the cheese was just so perfectly melted. She said it's one of the best she's ever had. The prices are restaurant prices so it isn't exactly the cheapest meal. But the food is sooo worth it. I definitely would come back when visiting Santa Barbara with out question. Beware of that red Salsa.. they use habanero so you'll be begging for a nice cold beer here too.,5 star rating,Daniel B.

1/16/2017,"Encino, CA","Driving from L.A. to Santa Barbara mid day is a no brainier especially on a week day. Pulling off of the 101 at Milpas St. I whack YELP to find a place to have lunch. When I do a YELP hunt for a restaurant, I need to see at least 4 Stars and at least 300 reviews. Hello, what's this; Los Agaves with 4 1/2 Stars and over 2,000 reviews. That was easy. I put Los Agaves in my GPS and went!I walk in and it's nothing like I expected. You stand in line and order. Get a number and put it on your table and wait. Get your own salsas at the salsa bar, your own utensils at that station and start dipping the rather good chips they give you. It's what I would call a fancier Poquito Mas.The food was actually very good. I ordered something I never had before: A Shrimp Molcajetes. It's this boiling pot or in Spanish called a Molcajetes (imagine that) with this great sauce and chilies and other good stuff in it. It's as messy as hell to eat (or maybe I didn't know how to eat this dish), but well worth the 12 napkins it took to clean me up. Their Guacamole was really good and my ice cold Pacifico beer hit the spot.I liked Los Agaves and would definitely come back.",4 star rating,Sidney Z.

4/10/2017,"Houston, TX","This was our first stop on our day trip to Santa Barbara and definitely one of the highlights! We came here because our friend suggested it and were so so happy with the recommendation. There is street parking around the restaurant and the interior is pretty large - which worked in our favor. For a Saturday at brunch time, it was suprisingly not that busy. It's a casual spot; you order and pay at the counter and the staff then brings the food to your table. The chips/salsa bar were almost enough to fill me up before our food came.I had to try one of their signature molcajetes (which are served in a very large molcajete - aka a stone mortar bowl). I had a chicken molcajete (without the chorizo) and it was amazing. First of all, the portion size is HUGE; definitely enough to split between 2-3 people. The bowl was akin to a chicken stew; very flavorful, slightly spicy, and piping hot. It was served with three warm corn tortillas and so so delicious. My husband got the chilaquiles with verde sauce and scrambled eggs, and they were some of the most delicious chilaquiles I've had - this was also a very large portion. It came with breakfast potatoes and a side of beans in a cute little tortilla bowl.We were super happy with the food and service here, and will definitely come back on future trips to Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Punya N.

Delicious.   The guacamole was a plate full not a small cup like at most places.   Their verde salsa was fabulous.  Only reason I'm not giving a 5* is that it's not a typical sit down restaurant.  You order up front and they bring to your table.  Would be nicer to have full service.  Also they only serve beer and I love a margarita with my Mexican food.  Would definitely come here again.,4 star rating,Deborah L.

Located in a cute and quaint neighborhood in Santa Barbara, less than a mile from the beach and downtown, this place will amaze you. The interior and exterior decor are nothing fancy, very Adobe-ish. They serve beer, wine and margaritas. We started with chips and guac. Not spectacular, but after adding some lime and salt to the guac, it was money! I ordered the steak molcajetes and my boyfriend ordered a combo plate with tacos. Both plates, BOMB!

There was a variety of foods--a beef taquito, red sauce chicken enchilada, a cup of beans, and grilled steak (yum!). It was $15.25, which was a little pricey, but we brought half of this back home as I could not finish it all.My husband got the chicken molcajetes. This was the first time either of us have seen something like this!! The spices were excellent and everything was flavorful, though Hubby complained that the nopal was a little difficult to break apart.The horchata was too sweet but wasn't expecting much there.

From their fajitas, chilli rellenos, green enchilladas to their amazing guac and sides!They have a buy one get one 50% off axxess deal which comes in handy, but even if I didn't have that I would come visit this restaurant many times over.

9/14/2014,"Vallejo, CA","Great food, the weird thing is that the star of the show for me, wasn't the main event.After a day at the beach, my friends wanted to grab something to eat, so this place popped up on a yelp search. Located on a busy main street, be sure to find a good time to look for parking, because there isn't much around the place. It was a busy weekend when we went, so we parked a little far away, but it wasn't a big problem for us, but it can be for some.The restaurant itself has a nice feel about the atmosphere. It's not a usual taqueria you would find in the middle of the city, it has an old-time feel to it with nice cultural decorations that fill up the multiple rooms inside. The flow of the restaurant is a little awkward though. There's almost always a line for ordering food, so where we sat, it was a little cumbersome to move through the line to get fountain drinks and salsa, which is in the corner.This brings me to the point to why didn't give the place 5 stars, the salsa was the highlight of my visit. I took many trips to the salsa bar to grab more of the (chips) salsa, because it was that good. It's my favorite type, where it isn't chunky, and it tasted fresh. I even smothered my Burrito Mojado with the stuff. The burrito was okay, plenty to eat, but it wasn't as tasteful as some places I've had. A lot of the menu items are pretty expensive, expect to pay upwards of $7 or more for the bigger items. But I guess the quantity makes up for it.If I were in town, I'd definitely check this place out again to try more of the menu, and to get more of the salsa (with the complementary chips). Check this place out!",4 star rating,Robert O.

I tend to avoid Mexican restaurants because the food is often loaded with salt, fat and mystery ingredients. I'm reformed! Los Agaves was fantastic.  I had the Shrimp Salad tossed with a complimentary dressing - fantastic, fresh.  We also had the Grilled Chicken Salad with dressing on the side, by request.

12/29/2019,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA","Visiting Santa Barbara from a distance for the day, this past weekend, and our mandatory stops include ""Los Agaves"". It was unfortunate our experience last night wasn't the same as we've experienced in the past. Their customer services definitely lacked. First, their employees rush customers to eat their food fast to make room for the customers who are paying. Second, since they don't have control on when to stop taking orders, new customers go looking for a table and stand next to yours until you finish eating. Practically stare at you while you eat (the whole time). Third, we witnessed their employee remove a side table from a family of three with a baby. This family had to hold their baby while each one of them finished eating, instead of having the extra table and chairs to let their baby rest. Overall, this place has changed from keeping its authenticity of quality of service. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. However, at the end of the day the customer service wins it all. That being said, we don't recommend trying this place due its customer service, not having control on when to stop taking orders and letting existing customers enjoy their food.",2 star rating,Steve V.

The restaurant absolutely deserves those accolades because I had a very satisfying dinner here.I would suggest starting your meal with classic margaritas. Getting a table isn't particularly difficult (first come, first serve), and the restaurant was somewhat empty on a Friday afternoon; although, people started filling in by the end of my meal. The Mediterranean Spanish styled dining space has a somewhat classical approach to the dining experience, but should work for a casual night out on Milpas street. Los Agaves has some nice combination of dishes for a modern Mexican dining experience in a fun atmosphere.I would definitely recommend coming here! This place is the best! (:",5 star rating,Marina B.

12/27/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","So I have never had a bad experience at Los Agaves until today. I had gone in a couple weeks ago and noticed they added an awesome looking happy hour from 2-5 mon to Thursday. So finally got a chance to check it out and we barely made it there by 4:45 pm. Just in time to order a couple awesome items.We get up to the counter and ask for nachos on the happy hour menu and they inform us for no reason they are not doing happy hour for that day.There are happy hour menus on surrounding tables, this is an advertised and public menu and for no reason say they are no longer doing happy hour.The best part is we are ordering just plain nachos, same ones on the main menu as the happy hour menu... so we want the same exact thing and they are telling us there's no happy hour.Well why are there posted menus everywhere advertising it?? And why can't you give us your advertised price of the happy hour nachos.For a restaurant that makes a ton of money, this is absurd. Also if you are an consistent repeat customer, asking for an advertised item on a menu displayed at the restaurant that you have in stock is ridiculous. So if your interested in checking out a happy hour, apparently for whatever reason the Los Agaves advertised happy hour from Monday to Thursday 2-5  does not exist. So don't get stoked if your chillin at Los Agaves one day and see a sweet looking happy hour menu on your table. It's not real! It's all a lie.

We came by back in December to see the place closed for the family being on vacation so we were kinda bummed but hey we made it back now and were extremely happy with our whole experience!The place sits on a corner with a small parking lot in the back, don't expect to find parking there and opt for the street parking which allows 90 minute parking, plenty of time to eat.entering the restaurant we were hit with the crazy heat from the kitchen which is just behind the ordering counter, but luckily there is another dining room to sit which is much much cooler. at first we were looking up at the board thinking that was the menu, but then a cashier hands us menus to read in hand so we thought those were the same. that is, until i looked up again while ordering to see the items on the board were the ""specials"". ah well, next time we will take a better look at the menu board.we ordered three plates that you don't normally find at a mexican restaurant, seems here they do more ""hard to come by"" menu items that don't necessarily succumb to the gringo pallet. we also ordered horchatta which was cool, sweet, and smooth, as well as a pacifico beer. each of the salsa was also surprisingly flavorful! usually these spots have a bunch of salsas that either all taste the same or all you taste is spicy concoctions of chiles. BUT the salsas here each had their own unique and tasty flavor. we are so used to adding salsas to each of our meals we felt bad when all we used the salsa for were the chips and barely used any for the food itself. the first dish we ordered was the Tacos Plaza de Toros, which is three tacos each topped with steak, mexican chorizo, and chicharron, and a side of guacamole and salsa. initially i thought each taco would be a separate meat, i.e. one steak, one chorizo, one chicharron taco. BUT come to find out, each taco contains all three meats, which isn't bad at all! the steak is tender and flavorful, slightly dry. the chorizo was also a little dry but had a great kick to the taco, and the chorizo was more like bread crumbs but piled on nicely atop each taco. the tortillas were soft and fresh, and the guacamole was absolutely delicious! i thought about adding salsa to the meats since they were kind of dry but then the flavor was still so good i didn't want to ruin or change the flavor of the taco!the next dish we had was the Chile Nortenos which were two giant poblano chiles stuffed with monterey jack cheese and shrimp with a chipotle sauce. the chiles were huge and open face, tons of melty ooey gooey cheese, perfectly cooked shrimp all in a delicious chipotle sauce with a tortilla underneath it all! this was absolutely delicious, filling, comforting, and so so good! it came with a side salad and rice too which was hardly touched as the salad was kind of an odd side dish and the rice would just be wasted space in the stomach. but i did have  abite and the rice was good. our last dish was the Quesadilla de la Esquina. three puffy quesadillas stuffed with oaxacan cheese, poblano chiles, huitlacoche, sour cream and other herbs and spices. this also came with a big side of guacamole and salsa. The puffy quesadillas were warm, crispy, golden brown, the cheese was stuffed and loaded into each quesadilla, the veggies and other fillings were all delicious and covered in the delicious flavors and ooey gooey cheese! oh so good!at first you think this place is kind of expensive, but then when you actually see the plates, with how much food and how much guacamole, then all the salsas available, and then the quality and taste of the food, it is definitely worth it!! our meal was about $50 but not a single penny was wasted or thought to be overpriced. we will happily return and enjoy another meal!",5 star rating,Alex J.
3/30/2018,"Paso Robles, CA","Pretty solid Mexican food. We ordered their ceviche, green chile burrito, los agaves burrito, los agaves enchiladas, steak nachos, chicken quesadilla, combo plates with sope, crunchy taco and enchilada. Portions were huge for a fair price. Everything tasted great, definitely a must try when in Santa Barbara. They get pretty packed and busy, but the restaurant employees do a great job of moving things along. Food came out in no time.",5 star rating,Hue D.
1/25/2019,"Merlin, OR","Simple, ultra fresh, fast, tasty and very affordable authentic Mexican fare.  It was Taco Tuesday so we had...TACOS.  I chose carne asada and carnitas.  Both excellent with freshly made tortillas. I ordered a side of Spanish rice - it was THE very best I've ever had, and I've had a lot at many different places. Love the taco bar with several tasty salsa's to choose from, along with other sides like radishes, lines, cilantro and green onion.  Would def return to try more on the menu.",5 star rating,Susan E.
5/11/2016,"Los Angeles, CA",The most amazing Mexican place I've ever been to. Being from the east coast I can promise you that I'm not Mexican food expert. I am an expert at great flavor and service!If I could give 10 stars I totally would! Although there sometimes was a long line to order food if only took minutes so your food to arrive at your table after placing your order. So if you are hungry and want your food right away this is the perfect place.Don't get fast service confused with fast food! Fast food isn't good but fast service because the meats have been marinating all day and just need to be added to the dish is what I'm talking about!All the plates at my table were loaded with meat! No skimping or cutting corners here. Mouth watering flavors that will leave you dreaming about it days later like I am. I ordered the land and sea dish! It came to the table piping how with the biggest pieces of shrimp I've seen in a long time! Worth every dime!!!!Next time I am in Santa Barbara this is a must have officially for me!,5 star rating,Stevi B.
6/8/2019,"Irvine, CA","Great food and will come back again if we are in the area. It looks like one of those ""wait to be seated"" but it's not. Fall in line and order your food then find a table. Must stop by if you are in Sta Barbara.",5 star rating,Hadji C.
5/15/2016,"Encinitas, CA","So damn good! The nachos were amazing and had the right ratio of tortilla chips to cheese and guacamole. These were probably the best restaurant nachos I've ever ordered and well worth the price too. The best part of this place is their selection of salsa. The mild green salsa which I think is avocado salsa was so delicious! The crispy tacos were meaty but I feel like there was something missing in flavor and taste. My friends loved all their dishes which were the enchiladas, burrito and steak. The peppers that come with the plates are spicy so be careful if you decide to take a bite. Parking is limited but we came right when it was empty, the food didn't take long to come out either but I was told that we got lucky with how fast it was. This place is great and well worth the wait. If ever in Santa Barbara again, I wanna come back!!",5 star rating,Kitty C.
4/17/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","If I got here 10 minutes later this may have been a 4 stars for the long wait time.Since I didn't get here late.  Five stars for the service and food.  Even if when I asked a table if they were leaving because there weren't any tables the employee picking up the plates said ""you have to order first"" I replied we did and pointed my soda to her.  I didn't see her around Any more after that.  We got the sampler plate something that was like soup with shrimp chile relleno and al pastor burrito with a side of guacamole.  Everything was yummy yum yum!!!The place is clean and they have a salsa bar.",5 star rating,Toma C.
7/11/2016,"Seattle, WA","Woops I thought I already reviewed Los Agaves! I have now been here twice. I initially came here because of the tremendous reviews here on Yelp (Thanks, Yelp!). Los Agaves is a nice little Mexican restaurant located in the heart of Santa Barbara. There's actually quite a bit of competition for similar type foods down the street but it appears that this has really risen to the top!Los Agaves doesn't look like much on the outside but you can tell it's something by the number of cars parked on the outside. When you get in you are drawn to the long line of people ordering. Remember to order at the counter first then sit yourself down and bring your order number with you so they can serve you. The Mocajete is what people come here for which is a boiling lava rock pot of food that you can serve yourself in a corn tortilla that comes with the meal. Be careful of your white clothing! You can get stains from all the bubbling that happens! You can choose from several different types of meats and enjoy yourself!For those looking for something a little less messy, your tacos and burritos are great choices. Try the appetizer quesadilla zucchini flower. It's amazing and very tasty. The cheese they put in there is thick and they actually fry the tortilla before the fold it giving it great taste and texture. I always get the carne asada which is nicely cooked and then I flavor it with some great salsas that you can get at the salsa bar. They are quick and large portions. Probably a little more expensive than what you might expect from a food place like this but they make up for it by the quantity of food you get.",4 star rating,Eric C.
4/8/2018,"Laguna Beach, CA","With over 2,700 reviews and 4.5 stars I figured a visit to Los Agaves was a safe bet. Boy was I right.

3/11/2019,"Houston, TX","This place was heaven! After a long drive from San Francisco which has horrible Mexican food (being from Texas I love a good Texmex or Mexican food), this place made me so happy. I got michelada and the tacos.

Pro tip: Get the Agaves Enchiladas. It's filled with yummy fresh fish and shrimp and topped with an amazing sauce. You will not regret ordering those.",5 star rating,Kyle T.
11/10/2014,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA","With all the reviews, not sure mine matters much but here it is.Let me cut to the chase -- I ate here and had a fantastic meal. Then I came back twice driving a few miles from my hotel room.Apparently, after a delicious and healthy feeling meal, my wife had left her purse and sweater in a seat at the restaurant. I went back to ask for it and the staff was super friendly and yes, there they were.I returned to my hotel the hero and my wife's first question was if I got our daughter's sweatshirt. Ah ... This time, I called and they had that too. So back I went and they retrieved three of my family's items with no complaints.As for our meal visit, they're super popular and we had arrived before 6pm on a Saturday. By 6:00, the line was well out the door. When we were walking in, we noticed the local fire fighters were getting food to go (fire truck was outside) -- always a good sign when fire fighters or law enforcement dine at a place.You order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Even though it's counter service, the food is high end.Food came out super fast and it was delicious.I had two halibut tacos with rice which was delicious. My wife had a veggie tostada and daughter had a crispy chicken taco but mostly ate chips and guac.I can see why this place is popular. I really, really appreciate the staff for recovering my family's numerous misplaced personal items left behind. They were friendly and helpful all three times I was there.Parking is a challenge. The lot in back is small and there are some restrictions on neighborhood parking. It's so worth driving around looking for a space.Definitely going back next time I'm in SB. Already looking forward to it.",5 star rating,Eric W.

The line was out the door when we came and we had a toddler and a 4 year old, so we wanted to make sure we had a table. My husband asked a couple of the wait staff if we could sit on an empty table, unfortunately, they told us we had to order first. That was a bit annoying. When we got closer to the cashier, the same Asian lady we had asked told us she had a table ready for us. Excellent customer service, five stars for that alone. Then came the food. Fish tacos were absolutely delicious. Fish was crispy and lightly battered, tortilla was homemade, and portions are out of this world! You will definitely get your money's worth. I had a taste of hubby's lengua, and it was melt in your mouth superblicious! I didn't taste any gamey-ness at all. My toddler loved the chips and salsa.

It's an order at the register and sit down and it's delivered to your table kind of place. We came in around 1 and it was pretty busy. Despite this, the staff set up a table for us right away.I ordered Baja tacos. I really liked them, they had a little bit too much sauce on them, but overall I would try them again. The other girls ordered, tacos del mar, steak tacos, open face tacos etc. Everyone was really pleasantly surprised and excited. The only down side was finding parking.",5 star rating,Danielle W.
11/12/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","I definitely don't see myself ever coming back here! Was in the neighborhood and with a group ready to have lunch... we were hungry and wanted to try someplace new in SB. Yelp lead us here... The reviews seemed great and we knew exactly where it was. Upon arrival it was packed- this usually indicates a good sign right ? Boy were we wrong. We ordered and then found a seat. Our drinks arrived to the table and they were great! (This is why and the only reason I'm giving one star). I had the Michelada which was perfect. Then came the dishes ... this is where things went south, fast. I had the los agaves sea food burrito. It sounded amazing. Too bad not ONE piece of sea food in the cold burrito drenched in some strange sauce. The tortilla was soggy and was too messy to pick up while the knife they provided wasn't sharp enough to cut into it either. Then finally once I did manage to cut it in half I found nothing but wilted lettuce and veggies inside. Naturally I let the waitress know and her reply ? ""Oh, I guess I'll bring you another."" I was shocked ! I let her know I was fine and would just share with my group and nibble off their dishes as it was almost time to go anyway and there was no point in waiting on another dish. As we got up I let the manager know of this experience and asked for a refund since I had not eaten a single bite of this over priced dish that was sent back. He thought I was a liar and questioned me before agreeing to cash out my refund. He said there should have been tons of sea food inside as this was the best seller on the menu. I replied, yeah and that's why I ordered it! It sounded great but what was served to me fell very flat. I'm a fair person and i realize it could have been a mistake or one off in the kitchen. It happens. But what baffled and shocked me was the way this was handled....every single person in this restaurant had a horrible attitude and I then realized on our way out that the only reason it was busy was because of the college kids who filled the place up as their near by study/ lunch spot. Will never return nor will I recommend you visit here either. Not to mention the place was a bit of a dump. Very dirty tables and flies all over. Save your money go anywhere else on state street instead.",1 star rating,Tiffany S.

5/29/2018,"Monterey, CA",Found this place through Yelp. Was turned off by the parking situation and line out the door. But on the other hand we knew it had to be good with the reviews and the crowd. We decided to wait it out and trust there would be a place to sit. The manager roaming around cleaning tables and ensuring everyone had a place to sit was very nice. He wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty and worked wherever he was needed. He was able to find my family a place to sit and made sure we liked it.

Los Agaves is known in the community to be the TOP Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara and arguably in the state of California. Entering the restaurant, you have to order the food up front then go find a seat. I would recommend having one of your party members go get a table while someone else orders. The chips are fresh and the salsa is incredible!!! I recommend getting the dark/black chipotle one. The food:Tampiquena: cheese flautas, red chicken enchilada, beans, carne Asada ( get it medium rare). Everything cooked perfectly, large portion, very tasty. Wow factor!!Green chicken enchilada: the sauce is incredible. It's light, creamy and flavorful. The chicken was between dry and moist but over all pleasant.

3/1/2016,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","Los Agaves is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever. The restaurant uses fresh ingredients, and the presentation is creative.The seating situation is a little funny. You order at the counter, and then you either find a seat if it's slow or you'll be directed to a seat if it's busy (it usually is). They bring you chips, and they have a really expansive salsa bar. There are milder ones like pico de gallo, and also spicier ones with roasted peppers. They're all really tasty.I've had their breakfast and really enjoyed it, but I prefer lunch/dinner. The Agaves Enchiladas have a chipotle sauce that is DIVINE. Also, the dressing they use on the salad that the give you as a side is amazing.Come towards the beginning of the day to avoid the rush, or just get it delivered!",5 star rating,Beatrice C.

9/11/2016,"San Francisco, CA","My boyfriend and I were on our way back from a road trip and yelped for local restaurants. After reading a couple outstanding reviews my boyfriend had to try it as we are big ""fucking Frisco foodies"". I personally took the reviews with a grain of salt being from Oakland /SF and half Mexican. I know good Mexican food. We got there and ordered the recommended plates and holy testicle Tuesday! The food was ugh drool. The presentation was drool. The smell was drool. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I ordered the land and sea dish which was served in a big molcajete. They are not stingy with their meat I tell you. It had fish,shrimp, beef, chicken, clams cooked to unison perfection in a thick soup sauce. The tenderness in the beef. The snap in the shrimp. Even the cactus was perfection! And the fresh gordita tortillas... I can't. Food orgasma! My boyfriend kept sampling my dish. My boyfriend ordered the Agave burrito. The creamy special sauce... I think I just wet myself thinking about it. Everything inside cooked to perfection. And the salad that came with it... Ugh drool. I'm a big salad person. Usually Mexican restaurants suck at salads. You usually get some chunks of iceberg with a couple slices of tomatoes MY PEOPLE, THAT IS NOT A SALAD.  But this place; tangerine, mango bites, romaine lettuce drizzled with some fucking fantastic magical mango dressing and fetta cheese. NOW THAT'S A SALAD. And if that wasn't enough, the service was unhumanly kind! They ask if you want more chips with a genuine smile. Are you guys food angels?! Am I in food heaven?! (The salsa for the chips were good too)Their courtesy made me want to eat more. It was clean in there too, even the bathroom!  Definitely worthy of all its great reviews. If you go, you HAVE TO try the land and sea dish. Go hungry. It's a hardy meal.",5 star rating,Trinidad M.

12/9/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","While researching restaurants to try in Santa Barbara, Los Agaves appeared in nearly every local food blog and dining magazine. It was even recommended to me by the hotel that I stayed at as a ""must try"". Just about everyone in town knows about this place I guess. I was not surprised to see that this eatery has the most Yelp reports written in the SB area. When I entered the restaurant, I found the dining area to be very open and casual. Customers would order at the counter and then find a table to sit. The system reminded me of fast food service. There were many tourists and foreigners.Los Agaves' menu was unofficially split into two sections: ""specials"" and ""boring items"", the latter including burritos, salads, and quesadillas. It would be a waste of time to come order them, so I selected two specials from the black board, the molcajete and cochinita pibil. Neither of these dishes are native to Guadalajara, which is where the chef-owners are from, but the chefs at Los Agaves appear to be talented enough to cook food from other regions of Mexico in order to label them as house special items.When the food arrived, I thought that cooking and execution of the dishes were elevated to a totally different level than expected. Everything exceeded expectations.Land and sea molcajete was truly heaven on earth. Every element of the Oaxacan style molcajete was absolute perfection, from the extremely blend of spicy tomato base to the fresh ingredients such as grilled nopales, queso fresco, chorizo, fish, and scallops. The steaming hot salsa base was extremely flavorful and versatile enough to pair with every single meat in the molcajete. What pushed this dish over the top was the inclusion of homemade corn tortillas. The tortillas were thicker, more hydrated, less crumbly, and had more flavor than the store bought packaged versions. You can't eat the molcajete without these fresh tortillas.The other dish we ordered, cochinita pibil, is a traditional delicacy of Yucatán and common to find in Cancun. Despite the use of whole spices in this dish, it was significantly less spicy compared to the molcajete. The cochinita pibil featured pork shoulder meat that tore apart effortlessly and had somewhat crispy edges (texture somewhat like pulled pork). The meat was drenched in a pool of thick citrus-earthy sauce that had an addictive flavor. The inclusion of pickled onions in an interesting pink-purple hue not only added color but brightened up the overall flavor profile. On the side, creamy black beans and a very spicy grainy salsa accompanied the meaty cochinita pibil. I could not stop eating the pork and beans in the supplied tortillas, so I had to order a second round of homemade tortilla. The combination was that good!Finally, I have to mention that the 6 salsas available at the salsa bar were all exceptionally complex. Each salsa had a distinct flavor and spice level. The variety was several notches higher than all the salsas I've tried at Mexican restaurants in LA. My favorite type was a red, thin, mild one that had strong roasted and slightly bitter flavor. It reminded me of the taste of a mole I had before, and it was great with chips.  Perhaps the main reason why the food at Los Agaves is so addictive is because the chefs use natural ingredients, nothing from cans, and everything from the salsas to tortillas are prepared daily from scratch. The meal tasted like something a Mexican grandma would serve at home. Los Agaves will definitely be my first stop the next time I return to Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Felix L.
7/31/2016,"Pasadena, CA","We were on a day trip to Santa Barbara on 07/30/2016 and we decided to take the advice of Yelp and try out Los Agaves, which is located quite a bit back away from State Street; however, a short drive or a lovely walk.We arrived.  We immediately noticed that this was a counter service facility; however, the line moved relatively quickly and the food also arrived quickly.They do bring around complimentary chips and there is a salsa bar up front, where you can choose from a wide variety of salsa for your chips and/or meal.I had the Burrito Mojado, one of us had the Chile Nortenos, and other the Chicken Sope.  We all agreed that the food was excellent.  Why not five stars?  Well, one major complaint.  The temperature in the facility was quite unbearable.  When you walk into the first room, the temperature is so very hot.  The temps coming from the kitchen are quite ridiculous.  The organization of the facility is also quite off.  The staff has to come out of the kitchen to deliver the food and has to keep excusing themselves to get through the line of people out the door.  In my opinion, this place needs a major remodel and they need to make better access for the staff near the back of the restaurant.  They definitely also need a major climate control upgrade.Go for the food, but maybe get take-out (or come at an off-off time)",4 star rating,Ryan S.
12/22/2016,"San Jose, CA","Simply the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara. Elegant decor, amiable service, and delicious dishes make this a must visit.Although the dishes feel light, they're filling and packed with flavor. Any molcajete is mouthwatering, but any menu item honestly is an appetizing choice. Enchiladas and Chile rellenos are wrapped in flavor!Their drinks are also flavorful. If you're going nonalcoholic, their horchata is perfectly sweetened. If alcohol is your aim, their margaritas and micheladas are pleasing alkie mixtures.Los Agaves is a mixture of amazing food and a worthwhile experience.",5 star rating,Wesley B.

10/11/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Such an unexpected stop here.  I happens to come down to millas street to get my car serviced, and since they said they would take over an hour devised to stop by for a bite to eat.  Come in at perfect time right before the lunch hour rush.  Only few tables busy, thank gof for that cause within few minutes the place was busy, even a pretty good line.  So as soon as I walked in one person offered me the menu, and mention of their daily specials up on the board.  The two ladies at the register super friendly, and they did explain couple thing on the menu that I asked about.  Ended up with the classic sope and enchilada!  Both super delicious, the beans were actually pretty good too. Forgot to mention that when I found table, set my number down and walked to get salsa, when I came back chips were already waiting for me!!  Later on somebody came by and ask if everything was ok or I needed anything.  Great service all the way around!!  Now I hope my car is finished, so I can be on my merry way!!",5 star rating,Erin K.

Good luck with parking but this place is worth the struggle. Today I has some mole enchiladas and they were rich and tasty.

12/2/2019,"Albany, CA","We were just passing by Santa Barbara on our way back home at N. Cal, and stopped by this place for lunch since it got rave reviews on yelp. There was a long line when we got there at around 12:45 pm. At first, I thought we have to put our name to be seated, but it turns out, you stand in line to order. Once you placed your order and paid, you look around the restaurant for an empty table. The staff is very good at finding you a table, so no need to worry while you're still waiting for your food and there's still no table available... you'll get one before your food arrives. Now with the food, we ordered ceviche, one item combination with soft steak taco for me, my hubby got the steak plate and my daughter got the plain burrito. Everything was good. We did not expect the ceviche to be big, but it was big and we have to get it boxed so we could eat it while on the road. My daughter's burrito was huge, so we have to box that as well, and she had it for lunch the next day. My steak taco had a lot of meat in it,and once you put some salsa from their salsa bar, it was perfect, plus the rice and beans were tasty. Hubby killed all his food before i finished mine, so that just tells me that he enjoyed it. I'm so glad we went to this place because we had a wonderful lunch.",5 star rating,Ana A.

6/4/2016,"Irvine, CA","This place is very popular that I could not find an empty table around 2pm. I ordered a shrimp molkajete, a wet burrito (burrito mojado), and tacos del mar. All of them were delicious with generous portion. My favorite was molkajete because it tastes unique. The complimentary chips they give was really amazing with their salsa  too. (I recommend green salsa from their salsa bar)The atmosphere of the restaurant was good but it was kind of too noisy for me. The only thing I did not like about the restaurant is their restroom. They only have a restroom for a person in the restaurant, so I had to wait for so long (they have one more outside, but that one was smelly and dirty that I did not want to use it)",4 star rating,G.J B.
11/26/2017,"Cypress, CA",Oh the line to order was pretty long.  It took 15 minutes with only one person taking the orders.  But it was worth the wait... food came out relatively quick after placing the order.  The Baja tacos were delicious and the mojado burrito was to die for.  We also ordered side of Chile relleno and guacamole.  Man we really ordered a lot because their portion sizes is huge.  Guac was also of generous proportion and Chile relleno itself could have been a lunch.   I would definitely go back again to try their numerous salsas from the bar and having a cold Mexican beer.  They have a location in Goleta as well which we found out later.,5 star rating,Sam P.

This says alot as we live in Oxnard which has pleanty of authentic mexican restaurants. We opted to try something different this time and ordered a molcajete, one of their specialties. We ordered the sea and earth, which came with shrimp, chicken, steak, chirizo, and fish. This dish was packed with flavor! Very glad we ordered it.We also shared a ceviche tostada which was great. Very fresh! Their Micheladas are also very good, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to micheladas....This place is always busy, so expect a line.

So they helped get me a table and him some food early. But really. It's all about the food. I would give it a 12 if there was such a rating. I had the seafood stuffed chile relleno. Omg!

11/30/2015,"Berlin, Germany","After arriving at santa barbara from a long trip we decided to have late dinner at los agaves. Los Agaves was some kind of fusion between a restaurant and fast food. A counter where you order your food yourself, but with waiters who take care of you and ask you if everything was ok. I liked it. They had a huge choice of food and for me a bit over average priced. But then I realized why. The food was massive. I had a Burrito that was the thickest I have ever seen. One dish could feed two people. My friend had sopes and the toppings completely covered them so you could only see the topping and no more sopes. At the same time it made feel like they wanted you to get full instead of eating good food. I couldnt sleep that night and my belly was grumbling from all the beans. Still, quite recommendable if you have a large tummy. I also suggest not to have late dinner there.",4 star rating,Eypee K.

1/12/2014,"La Mirada, CA","What: Sunday lunch wrapping up the bachelorette weekendEats: chips, salsa, and the two combination (beef crispy taco and chili releno)Takes: Salsa bar is on point! I wish they had labels saying which one was which. Because of the lack of labels, we ended up getting one of everything. Different textures (smooth and silky to chunky) and spiciness. Basket of chips are refillable! Don't be shy! The beef in the crispy taco was not the ground beef variety bit rather the shredded beef. Both that and the chili releno were packed with flavor. I loved the presentation of the beans which were in a tostada shell (no cup necessary!), but my favorite part of the dish was the Mexican rice. Usu I'm not much of a fan of Mexican rice, but theirs actually had more flavors that blended well together.Service: You order at the counter and seat yourself. The tables and chairs are so close together. You are literally just about back to back to the next table. This is def not the place if you want some wiggle room unless you come in when it's not packed (which was actually rare during the 2hrs we spent there).Price: 2 combo with a small drink was $13.50 (tax included). With the portion sizes you get, this place is super reasonable.

If I lived in Santa Barbara (which unfortunately I don't...), I would be here every week.You order at the counter, then get a number to go find a seat and wait for your food.

By the time we made it up to the counter, I was so excited! My husband ordered the chimichanga and I got the chicken mole enchiladas. By the time we got our drinks, picked up a few salsas, and grabbed a table, we already had a waiter bringing over chips. And literally, 5 minutes later, we got our food! I couldn't believe how fast the food service was. First of all, the salsa bar is not to be passed up...I was very impressed with all of their salsas, especially the verde avocado one (sorry I can't remember the name). Our food definitely lived up to the hype. My chicken mole was absolutely fantastic, and a mole is not easy to make.

11/24/2018,"The Villages, FL","We went here based upon great trip advisor and high star ratings on yelp.  Showed up at 5 PM with 11 people and only had to wait 10 minutes for table set up.  You need yo order at the kitchen/register, they give you a number for your table and then you wait for the food.  We ordered an appetizer and had to request it be delivered before the entrees arrived.  It was good guacamole.  Most orders came out fairly quick, except one Baja shrimp tacos finally showed up after most everyone's meal was consumed.  Said they needed to make a new batter for the fried shrimp.  Would have been nice to have notice of that and alternative entree could have been ordered.  When we were all finished, the ordering line was at least 10 persons long.   Demand from others was there, but we thought it about average, with some slip ups.",3 star rating,Greg T.
4/6/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Los Agaves burrito. Every. Week. It's worth it.... with an extra side of rice! Yes. In fact, every item is amazing. I can't even begin to describe my love for Los Agaves. Although I gravitate to the Milpas location since it is the most consistent, the Goleta, De La Vina & West Lake locations are still outstanding. I had Los Agaves cater my graduation lunch down in LA and family from socal to norcal are now hooked. We love you Los Agaves, don't ever change.",5 star rating,Jackie N.

It was crowded but glad the workers helped find my family a table. That seafood stone (Molcajetes) pot was legit. So spicy that I would recommend sharing. We also had carne asada nachos which was solid.That salsa bar ain't no joke either. They have some kid ass spicy as hell salsas.",4 star rating,Kien M.
12/1/2017,"Orange County, CA","Food was decent, apparently ""rolled tacos""(taquitos) are there specialty.Had issues with the staff not knowing what the kitchen was putting out, and taking plates / glasses with out asking (or asking if you wanted a refill, only so you can wait another 10 minutes before they graced you with their presence again). Substitutions or exchanges (we had a issue asking for crunchy tacos and getting rolled tacos, not the same thing) where treated very roughly, and had to get the managers approval apparently.Will not make a point to go back to this place, they had there chance.",3 star rating,Scott P.
9/19/2015,"Bakersfield, CA","Great Mexican food with a laid back vibe. This place acts like a taco shop in ordering, layout and vibe but it delivers a high quality food experience. The flavors are strong and diverse. The salsa bar is a great example of the variety of spice and flavor. After that, the menu takes off. We had the Tampequenia and arranchera. Both were great.The beans here are distinct from basic retried or pot beans. The best way I can describe them is a mix of ranch style beans and pintos. There is a tomato sweetness in them and an almost gravy texture. They are served in a tortilla bowl.The rest of the meal was amazing - nopales, steak, pepper stuffed with Monterey Jack! Get here and eat!",5 star rating,Randy M.
10/23/2019,"Burbank, CA","Had the worst experience today with Los Agaves.  We placed an order through the catering department to have food ready by 1130 am, when we picked up the manager (Adriana) said they had no order.  We provided her with the contact information and verified with her that the amount around $260 was processed on end. She said she would start the order but needed to charge again. After 10 minutes she finally came out and said they had the order and they were preparing it.  The food was over an hour late and at $24 a person was not worth the he lunch request.  Go elsewhere.   This establishment doesn't even work to correct the issue.",1 star rating,JC K.

8/14/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","This is a 4.5 star restaurant, but I'm giving it 4 stars as the sea and earth molcajete digests in my stomach while I type from the Los Agaves parking lot. Maybe the 3rd time will be the final charm, and I'll update the rating to 5. One thing is for sure, I'm definitely coming back, and bringing my friends...Why 4.5 stars? Well, the food is 5 stars for sure. This is no taco bell or cheap Mexican hole-in-the-wall. And you pay for what you get: most entrees start at $12 and the median is probably $13 or $14.I've had the molcajete and the wet burrito (mojado) and both were on point. Especially the molcajete, which Los Agaves is known for. It's a stew with different meats or seafood inside, that you eat with a spoon or dip tortillas into (they give you 3).When you walk in, you stand in line, order and pay at the register, and they give you a number to take back to your table. Be sure to visit the salsa bar and load up on the 6 or 7 types of salsa they have. And warning: the habanero is very hot, and may kill your taste buds for the coming meal. The food comes out pretty quickly. I guess most of the staff is in the kitchen, making that food delicious and served quick.By now you must be thinking that this place sounds pretty perfect. And it almost, almost is. So what could have gone wrong?I've been here twice this week. The first time, I had the burrito mojado, and was 3/4 finished with it when I decided to go the restroom. When I came back my plate was being spirited away. Now, I'm not one to eat trash, but you never, ever take my food before I'm done. It's one of my biggest pet peeves. At least err on the side of caution: if there is even a crumb left on the plate, wait for the OK from the customer to take it away.I felt like a fatty, or like George Costanza eating out of the trash, when I asked for my unfinished burrito back. And that didn't feel good. Minus one star.The second time, which was tonight, it again almost went perfectly. The molcajete, sea and earth, includes a healthy amount of meat and seafood, enough for any bodybuilder. Not only that but I devoured the three tortillas very quickly, and, needing more to dip into the remaining meat and sauce, asked the kind 6'0 blonde manager for more. He got me 3 more, even though the kitchen was closed. By the way, the blonde manager deserves mentioning, because he does a great customer service job, making sure everyone is happy.But I have to mention that when I stepped up to order, the cashier, who had actually beckoned me to come up, was distracted, and barely acknowledged me. It took her a good 4-5 seconds to actually look my way. She was talking to someone in the kitchen. Why she chose that moment, after acknowledging my presence, was baffling and unprofessional. So that didn't feel good. After I ordered, she didn't give me my receipt or the table number. I had to remind her and ask for the receipt out of her hands. It was probably a minor slip-up, as it was late at night and the restaurant was winding down.But the details matter if I'm going to give you 5 stars, and when the prices can run $15 for one person (my meal: sea and earth molcajete and a beer, ran $22).Finally, the last slip-up which doomed (hyperbole much?) Los Agaves to 4 stars, happened, literally, as I was debating whether to give 4 or 5 stars. I was eating the last 1/4 bowl of my tortilla chips, because I'm a fatty like that, when the busboy started taking away the chips mid-bite! Seriously guys, take a second and see if I'm still eating something before you take it away. Give it like 10 seconds at least, or at least ask me. Never, ever take someone's food before they're done! You can ruin someone's entire dining experience that way.Still, the food is so good that I'll be returning a 3rd time to try the other menu offerings. And hopefully by then they'll have fixed their service blemishes.",4 star rating,Alan J.

Came down here about a month ago with my whole family to visit my Granny n decided to go to this place. We got our food very late and drinks at last without any apology from any employee...they only had long angry faces, rude attitude, and an unprofessional Manager who is full of herself without the skills to make her customers happy. Love the salsa bar, chips and the venue. I ordered Enchiladas Guadalajara with chicken and got beef.. I got my Granny a gringa al pastor and got a quesadilla ...said my food was sent out to another table without offering any apology. ..person checking food should be trained to perform with better skills...I would have given a 3 stars at least but Manager should have known how to fix a simple customer complaint.

The ceviche was decent, but not the best I've ever had. It was really hard to eat the coconut so we asked the waiter to bring it back to the kitchen staff to get it cut up, and he came back commenting on the fact that ""it was a lot of work to cut."" Okay dude, then don't a dish in a coconut shell if no one is willing to cut it up. The enchiladas were really good.

The micheladas at the de la vina location are a whole different recipe not good too salty and too much Worcester sauce. SAME SPECIALS all the time. Service has declined a lot too.

Los Agaves came up on yelp as one of the top rated places so we decided that this would be the perfect place to have a 75 degree December lunch.Ordering is easy, you order at the front, get a number, and have a seat. I ordered the seafood tacos (one mahi mahi and one shrimp) and my husband ordered the ceviche. The seafood tacos were delicious. I recommend ordering just the shrimp as they were juicy and more flavorful than the mahi mahi. They aren't puny little shrimps but nice big tiger/prawn size. The ceviche portion was huge for the price as well.Free chips for the table and the salsa bar had tons of options. Great lunch! Long line but it moved fast.",4 star rating,Betty C.

The chicken mole poblano was also soooo delicious. Just perfect. And the mole sauce was one of the better places in the country! The fajita burrito was outstanding as well. An explosion of flavors! Plus the staff was so friendly and nice. They went out of their way to be helpful which goes a long way with me. If you are looking for a fancy place with ambience this is probably not for you.

Besides the temperature it was still delicious and they don't overlook the details - salad was not an afterthought and the rice was shaped like a pyramid instead of slapped on the plate (kinda cool).

3/30/2015,"New Orleans, LA","Food really isn't too bad, the best part about the restaurant was the sauce and the complimentary chips. The dish I ordered had humongous prawns surrounded by a spicy chili sauce. I only received one spoonful of rice, but it was actually pretty filling if you combined it with the sauce around the prawns.The salad on the side contained mandarin oranges, raisins, and a creamy yellow sauce that was sort of fruity. We ordered our dishes with no cheese coming in, but they put it in regardless which caused a mix up in the dishes. However, it didn't seem to increase the wait time. The dishes came out extremely quickly, and the place definitely does a good job on combining fresh food with traditional Mexican cuisine.",4 star rating,Jimmy T.

I had the 3 crispy chicken rolled taquitos with their rice. The only downer was the food was a little soggy, but I have to attribute that to being take out.

These enchiladas were filled with shrimp and halibut and covered in a chipotle sauce. It came with a side of salad dressed with a mango dressing. *Enchiladas Suizas - Very tasty! Nicely grilled chicken with lots of cheese. The rice and beans were well done too!*Horchata - The perfect drink with the meal! We waited 30 minutes for freshly homemade horchata and it was worth it!Service was awesome! There are several parking spaces in the back. But there also seemed to be ample parking on the street in the residential areas.Overall, I was impressed with the amazing service, the quality of the food, and how quickly everything came out. Totally worth the trip!",5 star rating,Lily Y.

3/11/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 032/1003.5 stars. Came here during me and my boyfriend's vacation to Santa Barbara because I found out it was one of the Top 100 Places To Eat on Yelp for 2014. The Yelp Elite in me HAD to check it out!PARKING:Kinda rough. They have a VERY small parking lot that holds MAYBE ten cars. We were SO lucky and found one spot! Other than that, just neighbor/street parking. Very narrow streets..AMBIANCE:Pretty standard Mexican restaurant. We entered through the back door so it didn't seem that crowded at first... There were a lot of different rooms/eating areas/tables, which was great. However, there's the main front area where the line and kitchen are, and that area was SUPER crowded. The line takes up the majority of the space and nearly backed up outside. It was super noisy in that area, but in the other eating areas it was relatively quiet. You order at the counter, and then they give you a number and you sit wherever you like. I was really disappointed because I read on Yelp about a dish I REALLY wanted to try, and then when we got there they didn't have it! Such a bummer! I ended up getting steak quesadillas, and my bf got the wet burrito. Prices were pretty average with most sit down Mexican places. FOOD:Food was good, but not MINDBLOWINGLY good. My quesadillas were very delicious, but I've had some that tasted exactly like these at other places. It was yummy but nothing set it apart from other quesadillas I've had elsewhere. My boyfriend got the wet burrito which thought was very good and enjoyed a lot.Overall, I did like my food, I just didn't see why this place made the list for one of the Top 100 Places To Eat. It was on par with other Mexican restaurants I like, but nothing that made it unique or special.",3 star rating,Jacqueline R.
6/16/2017,"La Puente, CA",This is not real Mexican food. My tacos were served with meat on a tortilla only-- I had to ask for lettuce and tomato separately.My wife had two cheese enchiladas and the cheese was not even melted inside. This plate also came without veggies. The guy at the register who had a collared shirt in like the servers was not very helpful. I wouldn't come back here again. Only good was the guacamole and chips.,2 star rating,Miguel G.
7/24/2015,"Morro Bay, CA","When my boyfriend and I walked into Los Agaves, we were both taken off guard that it was counter service. Don't be fooled though, this place gives grade-A sit down service and the food doesn't disappoint. You even get complimentary chips and salsa like every other sit down Mexican joint. They have a self-serve salsa bar that had about a dozen FRESH, FLAVORFUL, AMAZING house-made salsas that were accompanied by fresh limes, onion, cilantro, etc... For being a counter service restaurant, they had plenty of employees on the floor bussing plates, and checking on tables. All of this for a reasonable price. Please please please do yourself a favor and eat here!",5 star rating,Summer S.
10/26/2017,"Costa Mesa, CA","Had to check this place out because of the 2k+ reviews and 4.5 stars and it lived up to the hype. You have to wait in a line to order and then you are seated by the staff and although I wasn't expecting that setup, it was worth it. We ordered the Land and Sea molcajete $20 , Agaves enchiladas $14 (with beans swapped for the salad), a side order of guacamole $6, Blood Orange margarita $5 and an IPA $5.. The enchiladas were tasty, but the molcajete was amazing... and I loved that it came with handmade corn tortillas.. both the IPA and margarita were good choices and the guacamole appetizer was good for two or 3 people. Best part of it all, the staff was Super friendly and on top of things. Great service. I'd definitely go back and order the molcajete again, and maybe try some fish tacos...",4 star rating,Robert A.
9/30/2018,"Santa Maria, CA","Stumbled upon this place and Omg I cannot wait to go back! The food is so good! Everything we tried, the handmade tortillas, the queso fundido, the Chile rellenos!

12/5/2018,"San Antonio, TX","Set-up wise, this is my favorite of all 3 locations in SB/Goleta. I also like it better than Los Arroyos because you don't get nickel and dimed for salsa and other things that make the dining experience more welcoming. I have yet to have something I don't like on the menu. Goleta has taco tuesdays, not sure about other locations but the crispy tacos are one of my favorite things!",5 star rating,Jewels R.

In a nutshell, fresh and tasty food at reasonably prices! Good service too!You start off by waiting in line (both times the lines were out the door), placing your order, getting a number and then find the line of people waiting to be seated.  Shortly after being seated they bring you a basket of warm homemade tortilla chips (complimentary)!  You can go over to their salsa station to get a variety of salsas to dip the chips in!Their steak and the Anaheim peppers are tasty too!There is a small parking lot behind the restaurant or you can try street parking in the residential area a block behind the parking lot.",4 star rating,Shirley K.

2/26/2019,"Adelaide, CA","Oh Santa Barbara...not only do you have wonderful weather and beautiful views, you have one of the finest Mexican food restaurants in the state.  Prices are a little high for such a laid back atmosphere and minimal level of service, but the salsa bar and super fresh food keeps me coming back.I had the Steak Picada this round and loved it.  Not sure if the tear in my eye was from the deliciously spicy salsa, the large portion that had me wishing I wore elastic waist pants, or the fact that the food was that good.  Whatever the reason, I can't wait to come back and try something else on the list.",5 star rating,Matt D.
2/11/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I absolutely LOVED it! So unexpected. I always thought LA had really delicious mexican food but this place was more DELICIOUS!While visiting SB, we went for a brunch. They open at 11am, and we got there at 11! Already, there were ppl sitting down and eating. That tells me, ppl can't wait to eat here!First, they have salsa bar. I personally didnt find any one particular salsa that was amazing, but i was able to pick and choose and mix my concoction so... that was a plus! We ordered: Molcajete-AMAZING (they give you so much food!) I LOVED it! Its like a seafood stew with jumbo shrimps, avocado, and chili. The warm spiced stew was pretty wonderful-It's like cioppino but better! =) (big enough for 2 ppl)Ceviche was so fresh. It came in this huge plate, almost like a salad. WOW! That was really good!I would def be coming back here. Staffs were all so friendly. I think like 4 different staffs came by to check up on us. Awesome! =)",5 star rating,Eunis H.
6/22/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Love, love this place. Reminds us of the food from Guadalajara, Jalisco, MX.

Parking is a problem though.",5 star rating,Michael S.
8/8/2018,"Orangevale, CA","We had dinner here during our visit to Santa Barbara. There was a 15 min wait even though we went late. Great ambience. Plus they had inexpensive Margaritas, which I loved apart from the food. Portions were huge and overall everything we tried was delicious.",5 star rating,Mia C.
3/20/2017,"Pomona, CA","I was super excited about trying this place but was not so excited about the subpar customer service. First, you order/pay at the front and then are taken to your table with a number. But besides getting your food out to you, the staff is not too attentive to your needs. They forgot to give my boyfriend the side dish that came with his fajitas and it took about 10 minutes to get their attention. It then took another 5 minutes since we had to ask two different people- the first one had forgotten about us. In that time I just started eating my food because I was hungry and my food was getting cold (but I did share!). Besides the service, the food was good, but maybe not quite as good as I expected a 4.5 star restaurant to be. -Baja tacos ($14): I loved the sauce and corn tortilla. But the fish and shrimp were a little too fried for my liking. -Steak fajitas ($16): the steak was more on the well-done side. Tough/chewy. One highlight was the complimentary chips. These were fresh and crisp, and their salsa bar is pretty great with a variety of different salsa, as well as lime, onion, cilantro, and pico de gallo. As for other things: -wait: we came on a Saturday for lunch and waited about 20 minutes. Line was to the door but went fast. -parking: street parking all around the block. -price: on the steep side for Mexican food. I'm not sure that with my experience I would come back. I think I'll stick to LA's cheap and casual Mexican food.",3 star rating,Linh N.
8/16/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","This place has been a go-to since it opened nearly a decade ago. The staff has always been polite and helpful, and the gradual expansion and upgrade of the dining space are great!I recently had the mole (mo-leh, not mole like the rodent) chicken enchiladas (with rice and beans), and chicken taquitos as an appetizer. The food quality is top notch--clean, fresh, with an appetizing presentation. There really is nothing quite like seeing enchiladas doused and buried in the darkness of the mole. The taquitos were a pleasant golden crisp, not undercooked, not over-fried. Important note: the complimentary chips and salsa are standard here--not every Mexican restaurant offers this, thankfully Los Agaves does. The food left me wanting. You can definitely notice the attention that goes into the preparation, but the flavors weren't as strong as I would have liked. It may just be my taste, but I wanted a stronger flavor to the mole and instead got something a bit bland. I also notice when restaurants use dairy-based additions (cheese, creams, etc) to supplement for food flavor, and cheese covered my beans, rice, and taquitos, which wasn't necessary. It didn't give me a chance to taste the different parts of my meal, and ends up offering up a salty flavor. None of that is necessarily bad depending on what you expect. But for the prices at the Santa Barbara locations, I'd want a bit more than atmosphere--I want great Mexican food, which isn't expensive to make.",3 star rating,Chief E.
4/24/2013,"Ventura, CA","Do they NEED another five star review? Maybe not, but it must be done....Every time we would go by it was always so crowded... Finally went by on a weekday lunch, when there weren't a zillion people streaming onto the sidewalk... My husband and I got nachos and queso fundido.  A - MA - ZING!!!  When I showed the pictures to my boss on Instagram he claimed to have soiled himself and promptly visited, getting a righteous stuffed poblano.They are NOT shy about cheese here. I LOVE that about them!  Love the salsa.Loved everything.Want to try it all....Portions were ridiculously huge - the two items we shared could have easily fed six people!  But the bigness was not why we loved it. Loved it.  Loved it.",5 star rating,Carrie H.

3/22/2019,"Montecito, CA",Great salsa bar! We love to go to Los Agaves. They have good fresh Mexican food and every order comes with chips and salsa. You order at the counter first and sometimes there might be long line but it worth the wait!,5 star rating,Jenna D.

8/12/2017,"San Gabriel, CA",One of my favorite Mexican restaurants of all time! Takeout was really quick and under 15 min for two. You can always judge food accurately based on the salsa and sauce bar and I was absolutely blown away by how extensive and rich it was. The pico de ga llo was so good mixed with salsa and cilantro. Make sure to grab extra from the salsa and sauce bar because what they give you in the box won't be enough! The quesadillas I had were fat with cheese and steak and came with loads of thick guacamole and some sour cream. The chile verde burrito was super bomb as well and came with a nice house salad with mandarins.,5 star rating,Karen C.
9/18/2015,"Pasadena, CA","Super tasty, high-quality Mexican food, huge salsa bar, unique and delicious flavors, extremely fast service, free chips & salsa, tons of options for entrees! Not much to add to what so many before me have said. 1 star docked as the price of my fish tacos did not at all correlate with the amount of actual fish on them; pretty disappointing although they were extremely tasty. Of note though, my husband's burrito was chock full of fish, shrimp, and guac, all for a much more reasonable price. Lots of vegetarian/pescatarian options too. Additionally, the manager or possibly manager's son/relative was walking around and checking on everyone, and later we saw him sweeping the floors. Comforting to see their pride and investment in the restaurant; you can tell it has paid off. Will return if we're in the area!",4 star rating,Leanna W.

Here is my list:Pros:- decent fresh food - legit Mexican food - decent pricing (between $10 - $15 each)- decent parking in the back Cons:- dirty and sticky tables (someone needs to come through and clean them at least 2-3 times a day seeing there is no wait staff really, flies were breeding on them)- no waitresses to help besides the chip deliverer - food was just eh, nothing special from the hundreds of Mexican food places in LAAll in all a good food experience but nothing special.

Every single meal I have had here has been excellent!I know most of you all think that the sun rises and sets on La Super Rica, but you're wrong.

12/8/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","The appeal of Los Agaves isn't just the standard menu, though everything on it tastes very good. It's the specials board, with incredible and unexpected dishes like chile en nogada. And the specialties, like Molcajetes (bubbling hot-pot action!) and mole. The beef here is better than most (try the Tampiquena if you're extra hungry). The salads are pretty good too, though I got weirdly rubbery chicken on mine a couple of times.Brace yourself because the place can be busy (especially the Milpas location) and you order at the counter even though it's a sit-down restaurant.",4 star rating,Dennis T.

You will always find a table so don't worry about that. If you grab a table before ordering you will throw off the whole flow. The avocado salsa is spicy and has great flavor. The salmon tacos are amazing. Homemade corn totillas and good quality salmon topped with mango and a spicy sauce. Served with rice and a salad with the best mango salad dressing. So good we ordered the salad dressing to use for the salad at our wedding. If your really hungry AND have someone to SHARE your meal with, get the nachos! They are huge and piled high with yummyness!

You walk up to the counter and order your food. Once your food is ordered, you take your number and find your seat or an employee will assist you. They frown if you try to find a seat before ordering and receive your number.  What is worse is the regulars know the drill and will call you on it if you try to snag a seat early.Parking is very limited.Overall, great food and worth the visit if your in the area.",5 star rating,David S.
5/22/2017,"Grover Beach, CA","Found another great place via Yelp! We decided to try a new place while on a day trip to Santa Barbara and this place was top of the list.The place is nice but it is order at the counter and get a number style so not too fancy - dress as you please. Our group sampled several items including chile relleno, crunchy and soft taco combos, etc. All were very good or better. Free chips and salsa bar all tasted fresh and delicious.I thought prices could have been a little better but place was packed and house margaritas were only $5.Definitely going back.",5 star rating,Mike G.

4/25/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love the place, hate the noise.  The only reason I give it a five star because the food is stellar. I highly recommend the Molcajete.  Y u m m y!  The only draw back that there are no acoustics and it is VERY noisy. There was a kid crying in the restaurant as it echoed throughout the restaurant. We frequent the restaurant as we live nearby.  Best time to go is before 6pm and after 8pm for dinner, otherwise too noisy.  Best table is in the patio not as noisy.  Do not sit at an indoor table with kids.  Trust me on this.",5 star rating,Rita A.
10/31/2016,"Providence, UT","This place though!  Whenever I'm in SB, or CA for that matter, I go out of my way for the cheapest and best carne asada ever.  The reviews don't lie, folks adore Los Agaves.So carne asada - you get the meat, beans, rice, cactus, and the most delicious cheese on a green pepper - you'll be blown away guaranteed. The chips and salsa aren't bad, only problem is they food is ready too fast so you don't even get to pig out on chips!  Also the walk-up order is so much more efficient than seated table style.  Come early though to get a good table - they're often all full!",5 star rating,Todd F.

The service was on point too..Thank you for an overall great experience...we really enjoyed our day!!,5 star rating,Irene S.

6/9/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","On a drive back to SoCal from BigSur this was on my required list of things to do. While it's been 4 years since my last visit to Los Agaves, the food was just as delicious as I remembered. Being from California, I've had my share of Mexican food but I can honestly say that this has to be my absolute favorite. They were in the midst of remodel so the place was a bit cramped but some food this good - who cares? The only reason didn't rate them a five is for two reasons. #1 The order taker at the counter was sooooo unfriendly. I observed his interaction with the customers in front of me and after me just to make sure it want just me. He didn't say hello or greet me in any way. I just got the blank look until I just started to place my order. He told me my total, I paid - again, no response or even a thank you. Wow. Ok, but the food is good. A guy who appeared to be either the owner or manager was working the room clearing tables. He stopped by and asked how our meal was with a warm smile. The guy at the counter should take a lesson from him. #2 Not enough seating. Hurry up with the remodel of the second room already!",4 star rating,Chrissy P.

We walked in around 1:30pm on a Monday and there were plenty of people there but was not packed.  We decided to split the following: Chips & Guacamole, Chicken enchiladas with red sauce, and 1 crispy taco with beef. Everything was great!  The guacamole tasted fresh, the enchiladas were delicious and the crispy taco was refreshing.  The salsa bar was amazing as well.  The tomatillo salsa was my favorite by far but the medium salsa and the avocado salsa were really good as well. All the workers were friendly and food came out quick.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends/family.  5 thumbs up!",5 star rating,Sennett L.

We waited in line for a good 15-20 minutes or so before we were able to place our orders. Be warned: seating is limited, and parking sucks because everyone wants to eat here for brunch! Take advantage of the salsa bar for the complimentary tortilla chips they provide, but try to not fill yourself up with 'em before you get your food! Our group shared an order of steak nachos and a steak molcajete. Wow. Wasn't expecting a huge order of tasty nachos, and they did not fail to deliver. Sorry Freebirds, but these nachos have dethroned you 'cause they're clearly on a higher level. I don't know what salsa was in that molcajete, but it was delish. Tender steak, avocado and cheese... definitely have to try it again. FYI, 3 additional tortillas for the molcajete costs around $1.50 - $3. I'm not a pro when it comes to Mexican food, but the flavors that our food had going on were amazing. The cashier and our waiters were very attentive, and that's always appreciated :) Do give this place a try!",5 star rating,Ashleyann B.

Duh.  How else am I supposed to know what to eat?  LOLThough it was lunch hour and super busy, we got seated quickly.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was cheerful and casual.The food was also excellent.  We tried the Enchiladas Guadalajara -one steak, one chicken (both were good, but steak was a little better, IMHO)Torta Cuban - Cuban sandwich that's a torta!  Best of both countries.Quesedilla - these are giant-sized!  You know the big tortillas for rolling burritos?  Their quesadillas are two of these tortillas stuffed with cheese.  I couldn't finish it, so sharing would be good if other items are being ordered.This was a good spot to find on a ""just because"" day.",5 star rating,Peggy R.

There was guac salsa, green salsa, and their spicy red salsa was legitimately spicy. None of that mild stuff. Nachos 4/5We ordered the nachos w/ steak and chicken. The steak tastes better to me. Topped that plate with onions, pico de gallo and it's perfect! It comes w/ guac, beans (we asked for black beans bc I don't like pinto). Carne sada taco, rating 4/5This taco was GOOD. None of the lettuce filler. Straight corn tortilla and a handful of meat. Exactly how a taco should be. I add the onions and pico to my liking. Meat was tender and fresh. It was deliciously marinated and was well cooked. The seating was different than usual. We had to order at the front counter, then given a number and then we find our own seats. They offer chips and salsa once you have a number clip. I did not like the idea of single restrooms bc there is always a line for the ladies.",4 star rating,J. V.

The waitress at the counter was super nice, giving good advices and let me try the mole before ordering. Food was really good the mole is super rich and the chicken I ordered was perfectly cooked.

11/15/2016,"Sacramento, CA","Food: Single item chicken enchilada combination plate (with all rice) - The plate was enough to feed me and another person. The Spanish rice is SO GOOD!!! Best I've ever had and I love Spanish rice. It was moist enough, had flavor and I love how there were small pieces of onion still. The chicken enchilada was a good size. I couldn't finish the whole enchilada. It was moist and flavorful. The red sauce was so good on top. You have a choice of cheese, I wasn't sure so the cashier picked the cheese for me after asking me what meat I wanted. Chips and salsa were provided free. The pico de gallo was the best I have ever tasted. It had some flavor to it and the jalapeños was actually spicy, which I love!!! There's so many different sauces provided at the bar. A bowl of chips will be placed on your table by someone. Price: For three plates and two sodas, we paid $47. It's a little pricey, but the food is so good and the amount you get is a lot. Service: It can get quite busy and full, but a table will get cleared fast. There's menus provided near the exit, which is nice since you can decide on what you want to order. There's two cashiers that will help take your orders and they're really helpful and fast. Grab a number and place it on your table, and someone will find your table. There's a couple of employees who will go around asking if each table is doing okay.Parking: There's very limited parking in the back of the restaurant and it's small spaces.

They start you out with these perfectly salted tortilla chips and a salsa bar with an amazing selection. I think we tried six different salsas, and that didn't even include the ""hot"" (spicy) ones.Deliicious squash blossom quesadilla! It's fried with this light, fluffy batter, which adds just the right amount of crisp around that squash blossom. They're a hefty size for an appetizer too. Yum.

You order at the counter first, take a number, and find a table, which we managed to do even when the place was packed. Their complimentary chips and salsa were great, with a lot of spicy salsas to choose from. We ordered the chicken taquitos dorado, a burrito mojado, and Baja shrimp tacos. The taquitos were perfectly crispy and came with a generous portion of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. My boyfriend's chicken burrito mojado was great, since the burrito was stuffed with perfect proportions. My Baja shrimp tacos were amazing! They did not skimp on the shrimp at all and the tacos were topped with a pineapple coleslaw that paired perfectly with the crispy fried shrimp. My plate came with a side salad that was topped with mango and a tasty dressing, along with Mexican rice. The food here is amazing and definitely worth trying!",5 star rating,Avlyn P.
12/5/2016,"Highland, CA","Los Agaves has been on many ""must try"" foodie lists for many years now.  And quite frankly I can see why.  It's taken us a couple years to actually make it to this place.  Both locations are a bit ""off the State Street beaten path""; but trust me..this location, at least, is worth it!I must admit the ""flow"" of the place wasn't what I was used to.  It's a sit-down restaurant wth the ordering vibe of a fast food place; that is..you order your food up at the front first and then go sit and it's brought to you.  This threw me for a moment.  Was I at an Alberto's?  Oh no.. not at all!So at the heart of the matter was the food.  I had the Arrachera plate which consisted of a specially seasoned Top Sirloin Steak along with a cheese-stuffed Pasilla pepper, beans in tortilla ""cup"" and some of the most delicious Spanish Rice I've had in a long, long time.Wifey decided to go with a rather boring choice of a cheese quesadilla.  I ordered my mom a Chile Relleno plate to take home.The food was delicious and made to perfection.  The steak, whereas not Hitching Post II quality, was still very good and I enjoyed it muchly!  The beams, somewhere between whole pinto and refried, were also yum!  The rice was moist and flavorful!My wife, bless her tame Midwest palate, enjoyed her quesadilla and we both thought her house made Horchata was some of the best ever!The employees were very friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions.A minor complaint is that this location does not have a full alcohol selection.  They only serve beer and wine..and that's okay but the wifey was really looking forward to a Margarita with her dinner.All in all though it's a great place to eat.  I'm looking forward to trying the other location in Santa Barbara as well as the one in Westlake Village.  Four solid stars with the other to come after we've had a chance to explore the menu a bit.  Certainly try it when in town.",4 star rating,Wayne W.

I got the combination plate with two items, a chicken enchilada and a carne asada sopé. Being from the Los Angeles area surrounded by what I consider to be authentic Mexican food, I was not excited about the flavor of the enchilada and sopé. It's not surprising though due to the tourist location of the restaurant. It wasn't completely dissatisfying, but I think it could have had more flavor.",3 star rating,Ashley S.

We  got a giant carne asada burrito, a loaded plate of nachos, and so-so customer service. Their beans and chips were a little lacking in flavor and that homemade/ hearty, abuela-made kind of taste.  It's a casual, decently sized place with a big menu, where you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  Standard salsa bar included.

I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas and it was probably the worst fajitas I've ever had. The chicken tasted chewy and the steak was a little dry and the meat was flavorless.The rice was also tasteless and when I tried the flan dessert it tasted like thick custard instead of real authentic soft flan.Altogether it was a huge disappointment to say the least and a waste of $43 bucks.

The tables also get flipped pretty quickly. I got the seafood molcajetes and I'll admit, I didn't know what I was getting into so I was a little daunted when it came out. Ultimately it tasted great.

I live no where close to any of the locations (I live in LA) but I've definitely made up a reason to drive all the way to SB to just eat here. My friend who is from SB introduced me to this place and I was instantly hooked. I then brought some friends here on a trip to SB and they're addicted now too. The food is reasonably priced, the quality of the ingredients is high, and everything is delicious. I don't know what they put in their rice but it's seriously addicting and the best Mexican rice I've ever had. Also all their salsas are great, and I like that they are spicy rather than mild and bland like other places. I usually get the burrito mojado here which is a wet burrito that comes with rice and guac on the side. I've also tried the fajitas and molcajete and thought they were good but I keep going back to the burrito mojado because it's so amazing. I've been to all of the locations they have and the food is consistently good at each. If you're in SB or even if you're not, drive over here and have some amazing Mexican food.

And it turns out their closed until January 14.)Considering this wasn't our intended meal, but in the mood for Mexican, we were expecting a letdown. Fortunately, it didn't happen. After surveying the broad menu and consulting with the cashiers, we decided to split two items: the Agaves Enchiladas (seafood) and the Burrito Dorado (chicken).Burrito Dorado - all around delicious burrito, with flavorful filings. Only downside: the cheese inside was clearly not melted. The place seemed slammed last night, so I'll forgive them this. But it was a little bit of a downer.)Agaves Enchiladas - these rocked. With the exception of the fact that they were delivered maybe ten minutes after the burrito, everything was perfect. The chipotle cream sauce on top, the gooey melted cheese in and around, and the shrimp and fish filling. The accompanying salad and black beans in a mini-tostada shell were also delicious.Worth the time and $$ to eat here!",4 star rating,David B.

So many fresh options, we wish we had more chances to eat here so we could have tried multiple entrees.  We must return again in the colder weather to try their hot chocolate.You order up at the counter, and they deliver it to your table. The cashier is friendly, cheerful, knowledgeable and helpful.  A basket of chips comes free with your meal.  Features a salsa bar area and the restrooms are clean, tidy, and nice.I wish I had thought to photograph the fantastic dishes to share with you to show you how awesome their food is, but we descended upon it like ravening wolves.  Just know during the extreme heat months, there is no A/C.  Because of the proximity to the ocean, I'm sure they usually get a cooling breeze off of the water, but if you're hot and sweaty when you arrive, you'll remain that way during your meal.After dinner, we drove down to the ocean, found free parking, and took a lovely stroll to cool off and burn off a bit of dinner, making this an ideal first night in Santa Barbara.Loads of seating with beautiful tiling and paintings.  All ages eat here from mature midlifers to the local Santa Barbara college and university students out on a dinner date together.Would love to go here again when in the area.  Parking at this venue can be a challenge.

I know there are other Los Agaves in SB but this one is our favorite to come to. We especially love it because you order and pay first and then sit down, so when you're done you can just leave. Having a 3 year old this makes it super convenient and for us child friendly restaurants are a must. They have nice newer high chairs and the employees are always helpful and accommodating.

Then there is a salsa bar, where you can pick between several different types of salsa. There is also silverware in that corner as well. [Also side note: the bathrooms are also very clean!]I ordered ceviche (for the first time!), the halibut tacos, and a halibut/shrimp burrito (sorry don't remember the exact time!). Wow, all of the ingredients were so fresh. I wasn't into the ceviche (too sour, not sure if that's how it's supposed to be) and the tacos were a little dry. But the burrito was great, and the ingredients alone are enough to warrant this place 4 stars. Also the portions were huge!! I definitely did not expect the ceviche to be as large as it was!Because of the popularity of this place, there is definitely a little bit of a line, but I went during prime lunch times, ordered in about 15-20 mins, and got my food shockingly quickly (5-7 mins?).

Not walking distance from State Street, but a very short car ride away. // WAIT //     - 15 minutes a party of 2 on a Friday at 6 PM// HOW TO //     - Grab a menu and wait in line     - Order at the register and get a number     - Check in with the hostess who will seat you (the night I went was pretty busy, but I would imagine on quieter nights, you seat yourself)     - Food is brought to your table // FOOD //     + Salsa bar: the salsa bar is popping with a ridiculous variety of salsas and fresh garnish options including cilantro, pico de gallo, and limes I'm not much of a spicy food fan, but everyone was mobbing the bar for a scoop of salsa     + Fish and shrimp taco: Flavorful, succulent without being overcooked or rubbery.      + Agaves burrito: Huge and brimming with juicy meat and flavorful rice.Worth a try if you are in the SB area!",4 star rating,Pauline P.

I lined them up on the table, tried each one, then again, couldn't pick a favorite.I usually won't even get rice, but I had a bite of my husbands and it was perfectly seasoned with tiny bits of fresh tomato.  I didn't know rice could even be that fluffy!  He ordered the chicken chimichanga, I did a chile stuffed with cheese and asada.  Both were excellent.  The asada had the best flavor I have ever tried and was cut into nice size pieces, not minced like you sometimes find in a burrito.  This is place is currently in a tie for 1st place with Cuernavaca (on the avenue), for my ""Most Excellent Mexican Food in Santa Barbara/ Ventura"" contest I've been running with myself since we got back into town.",4 star rating,Julie Ann M.

Burrito mojado on day 1 and steak quesadilla for dinner the next night. Authentic food and best Mexican rice.. I would order a bucket and take it home with me. Decent prices and great service.

When my wife and I look for good Mexican food, the bar is quite high... and Los Agaves delivered! First of all, be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes in line during their busier hours. Also, it's an ""order at the counter, seat yourself"" place, and since it was very busy, we were hawking for a table. Be prepared to do some of that during high traffic times. My fingers were crossed that the food would be worth it!The service was very attentive and friendly, even when they were quite busy (in my experience). The food was outstanding! I ordered the Molcajetes Sea & Earth with Mexican cheese, green onions, avocado, chicken, steak, and shrimp in a homemade bowl of spicy salsa stew. Oh man!!! It was fantastic! Could've definitely fed two people! My wife ordered the Garden Burrito with grilled zucchini, green and red bell peppers & pinto beans topped with lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and fresh cheese served with rice on the side. Very good!If we were locals, this would be a regular place for us to dine. This place offers traditional dishes, as well as some contemporary takes and twists on Mexican food. Very impressed!

8/6/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","How did I discover Los Agaves?   Was it YELP, where the five star reviews bring it to the top of the list?  Nope!   Was it the News Press with the article on tacos giving it higher praise that the grand poobah of Santa Barbara Mexican restaurants, La Superica?  Nope!     It was my son in high school that wanted to go there for his birthday a couple of years ago.   Do you want to experience Santa Barbara's rising star?  The place that has suddenly become the ""in"" spot for good Mexican fare?   Then try Los Agaves!    It is to Mexican what Norton's is to Pastrami, what the Stonehouse restaurant it to fine dining and what Brophy's is to clam chowder!   The go-to place.   It has a line!  There is a wait!   It isn't small but it certainly doesn't have enough tables to meet the demand on a Saturday night.    But the line moves quickly, the wait is more than reasonable for what you get and the tables miraculously give you a seat right before your food is ready.  One of the best things is that there is a big menu!  I can go back there a couple of dozen times before I have tried everything.  On Saturday (yes, Saturday of Fiesta weekend--I wasn't the only person who decided to go here) I had one of their specials.   Chicken with mole and a couple of roasted peppers.   Delicious!   The funny thing about mole is that so often it just doesn't taste right--this did.    My wife had chicken enchiladas.  Both dishes were nicely plated and looked as good as they taste (take THAT La Superica!)   Another huge plus is an abundant salsa bar with some pretty damn good salsas! Buen provecho!!!",5 star rating,Douglas M.
8/12/2017,"Goleta, CA","Los Agaves is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. It is an interesting concept - without full service, but serving gourment food.The best dishes to have are either traditional Mexican dishes, like Cocinita Pibil or a Mole, or their seafood dishes - Agaves Enchiladas, served with subtle, creamy chipotle sauce, or Camarones Guajillos made with dried red peppers and pineapple.Their steaks are decent, too, although not that exciting overall. The salsa bar is great with same amazing home made Salsas.Makes you wonder why Chipotle exists in Santa Barbara when there are places like Los Agaves around.",4 star rating,Peter C.

And if I want more, gotta get back in line. The servers also check up on you to make sure everything was ok.,, that awesome. 5 stars for their food.....Food- AMAZiNG! This makes up for the location, ambiance and lack of table service. I ordered the shrimp in spicy red sauce (sorry forgot the Spanish name) .. The shrimp was not over cooked , the rice was excellent and the side salad had a great dressing. Let's just say the only thing left in my plate are the sauces that I ended up scooping with their chips...Everyone on my group loved their dish.. Now I'm regretting not ordering guacamole. ..

1/15/2017,"Atascadero, CA",Well all of the reviews about this place are true. The food is wonderful. One of our party had the mole and we all tasted the sauce and thought it was fabulous. Two of our party had the salmon tacos and they raved. I had the chicken and pasilla plate and it was excellent. Around the table we all agreed that we must return and hard as it may be order something different so we can test more items on the menu. This place is worth the stop. You wait in line to order or in our case we walked up to the counter and ordered and then claim a table and your food will be coming out soon. The salsas were nice. I like to Zing in the green salsa. The chips were nice and with a beer and the salsa makes a nice appetizer. I noted that after we sat down within a few minutes the line was out the door. Boy did we feel lucky to hit it at just the right time. Enjoy,5 star rating,Charley C.

No but seriously, it's midnight, and as I think back to my trip to SB a few months ago, my first meal of the trip was at Los Agaves after getting the recommendation from our Air BnB host; it was one of the best meals of the trip. I was all about Mexican food that weekend having tried three different places, including Super-rica. Los Agaves was the clear winner. I ordered the enchiladas with chicken; what makes the dish special? The VERDE SAUCE! It was a little spicy, it was different, it was magical. What the heck is in it?! My dish was served with a side of pinto beans mixed with this pineapple/agave syrup-- I took a quick taste but decided to just leave it in it's decorative tortilla chip blossom shell. Tortilla chips and salsa bar were also quite tasty! And my partner's burrito was huge; I stole his guacomole. :)",5 star rating,Leslie T.

I'm not sure how they do it but you order at the counter and then the staff seats you. I didn't see anyone who had to wait for a seat after they ordered. We ordered stuff we wouldn't normally order so no tacos, enchiladas, or burritos.  The food was amazing. So tasty!

12/27/2015,"San Jose, CA","TL;DR: Excellent, 'not-your-regular Taqueria' style food. Clean and well lit premises. Good for a group as it's quite noisy. Slightly expensive, but exceeds all expectations in terms of price.Entree: Sea and Land Molcajete - Chicken and Shrimp in tangy tomato sauce served with grilled nopal, Monterey Jack cheese and half an avocado in a stone bowl. Comes with a side of three tortillas.It was superb. It was quite spicy, but very tasty. They were very generous with the portions of shrimp and chicken. I had a tough time finishing it on my own.Service and Ambience: They have a very cheerful staff. The way it works is, you walk in, order, collect your table marker and then find a table. It was very crowded when we got there. But a server helped us find a place.There was some confusion where my friend was told they have run out of rice and therefore had to order a burrito without the rice. It turned out to be some miscommunication. They charged him full price on the burrito though. One star off for that.Tips: Do try all their salsas. If you are with a group, you all can discuss favorites later - they have that much variety. And free chips!Definitely try the Jamaican beverage made of (hibiscus?) flowers. Goes very well with the spicy food, cools you down.",4 star rating,Abhishek N.

I have oddly never tried seafood enchiladas, but the woman working the register recommended them and she wasn't wrong. I now dream about the food at this restaurant on a fairly regular basis.We ordered up front, collected our napkins, flatware and salsa then very quickly received our orders of Agaves Enchiladas and Tampiquena at our table.Salsa Bar: They have an exceptional fresh salsa bar with salsas ranging from mild to very spicy. The super spicy habanero salsa and the tomatillo were my favorites. We ended up going back halfway through our meal to refill due to the fact that we were struggling to not douse all our food in it.I ordered the Agaves Enchiladas. The perfectly cooked halibut and shrimp stuffed the fresh white corn tortillas lying in a cool chipotle cream sauce. My friend, who doesn't even like seafood, really enjoyed trying this dish. Would order again/10.I tried bits of the Tampiquena and was equally impressed. There was not one crumb left on our table. The food here was outstanding.

After ordering you can go find a table.Land and Sea Molcajete - I never had anything like this before and just had to try something new. It was loaded with halibut, shrimp, steak, chicken, avocado, pepper, cheese, and onions all in a hot tomato based soup. I ate this straight up and also fresh tortillas and chips. It all went well together.Agaves Enchilada with halibu and shrimp - This was really amazing. They really don't skimp on the seafood and portions. The shrimps were huge!

The fact that they usually have a line out the door and you have to order at the only passage in and out of the kitchen makes for a very unpleasant first impression. I'm not sure if the fine folks if Santa Barbra have never seen a Mexican restaurant before but honestly this place is decent but not to get in a brawl over.

1/12/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Santa Barbara for its southern California location does not seem to have many authentic Mexican food restaurants. I went to Los Agaves from a friends recommendation. The food was mediocre, not really having the authentic Mexican food taste and the price was expensive. The atmosphere was crowded and the employees seemed overworked or disorganized. Non-the-less the restaurant was packed with people. Therefore, I give Los Agaves three stars, because though I may not enjoy the food and atmosphere too much, many other people do. For a three star rating I rarely recommend people to give restaurants a try, but I must with Los Agaves due to the amount of people in the restaurant the night I was there. So, stop on by and give this place a try.",3 star rating,Nick P.

I'm not going for the full 5-stars yet because it has not blown my mind but just solid all around.PS - idiot reviewer who reviewed this place poorly and started with the line ""I don't like Mexican"" - what planet are you from that you 1) ate here and 2) wrote a review criticizing this place?

6/9/2014,"San Francisco, CA","Found this place by researching online and asking around for the best place to eat in Santa Barbara. There was a unanimous answer that it's Los Agaves.Parking: Street parking wasn't difficult to find (75 or 90 minute parking except Sundays). It looked like there was a private lot in the back, but I'm not sure if that was for this restaurant.Service: So, how this restaurant work was kind of confusing. First, you get in line to order and pay. They'll give you a number, and then someone will take you to a table. Then, they'll bring you chips and your food. You can grab your own salsa at the salsa bar.Food: Big portions and pretty delicious. I ordered the Agaves Burrito. The pan-fried halibut inside the burrito was amazing! I'd be glad to eat that fish on its own. The chipotle sauce was good, too, but I thought there was too much and that it overpowered the burrito. It was yummy to eat all the veggies with the sauce though. Also, the mangos were a nice touch to the whole thing.My tummy was very happy/satisfied after this meal, especially after a hike in the morning.The restaurant has long lines, but it seemed to move rather quickly. The line was out the door when I arrived at 1pm and the line was still out the door when I finished around 2pm on a Sunday.",4 star rating,Emily C.

7/5/2017,"Hermosa Beach, CA",Delicious lengua torta and pork tacos. I also ordered a crispy chicken taco for taco Tuesday and it was amazing. I don't usually order my tacos but this one was very enjoyable.  We also ordered the ceviche and it came in a huge portion. I wasn't very impressed with the flavoring and wish it came with more fish than just one white fish. Very popular and likeable Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara. I highly recommend their tacos!,4 star rating,Michelle G.

Just make sure to make a note of the time- I didn't notice a parking meter, but the sign said 90 minute street parking- am not sure how strict the city is in implementing it ;)Delish! Super delicious! I haven't tried Mexican food this good. The way they fuse the taste of each of the ingredients is just amazing.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Los Agaves burrito and the Sea and Earth Molcajete. He swears that he would take a trip to Santa Barbara just to go eat at this place. If you're planning on eating here, make sure you get there right when it opens or at an off hour. This place gets mad packed! Arrived minutes before it opened and a line was already forming. You order your food first at a cashier and then get seated. Take advantage of their salsa bar! Amazing variety and extremely delicious.",5 star rating,Jessica C.
6/16/2014,"San Diego, CA","High-end, but authentic Mexican in SB. Parking lot in the back is tight, so be ready to park on the street. They lose a star for the walk-up ordering. It was a bit irksome and undermines the otherwise gourmet experience. Very busy on a Fathers' a Day at 3:00. The seating system seemed chaotic, but it worked. Food came out fast. Fortunately, we didn't have to stand while we ate.Delicious salsas. Really enjoyed the chipotle and avocado, which were spicier than the claimed ""medium."" Wanted a meatless entree. Considered the Rajas con Queso (veggie tacos), but would up with the Molcajete, which included six of the largest shrimp I have ever had. Amazing presentation in a towering, rustic stone cauldron. Smokey and spicy, tomato-based sauce, served with delicious home-made corn tortillas. The downside is that it's a real pain in the ass to eat. You need to dip your fingers into the hot and spicy sauce and pull out most of the pieces in order to work on them before you can actually eat them! This means chopping a whole onion, slicing a pepper and pulling the tails off of each shrimp. As good as this tasted, I think it's simply not the dish for me...just too messy. Next time, I'll order the shrimp-stuffed Chiles Nortenos. Wife ordered the Agaves Burrito, topped with delicious creamy chipotle sauce.",4 star rating,Charles H.
9/27/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA",Ordered food while daylight was still out. Only if your dining in can you expect your food in a timely manner. I waited over 30 minutes.

The line was out the door but the service was fast (sister already been there so she knew how it all work. I can see how it can be confusing for the newbies but there were waiters walking around that you could have easily ask how the ordering works.) We each ordered something different  (agave salad, agave enchiladas, mahi mahi w/cilantro sauce, and the stuffed peppers with shrimp) and we started off with the ceviche. EVERYTHING WAS SOOOO FLIPPING GOOD!! The ceviche had chunks of fish and the agave enchiladas had a plethora of shrimp. Even my mom commented on how good the food was and my dad finished his mahi mahi dish. I called my hubby on my way back to NorCal and I told him that we have to go their next time we are in town.

(There is usually a line out the door) so I ordered via Yelp takeout while in line, which worked out great for me! It was so easy! The guy at the take-out station (I wish I'd gotten his name) checked me in. It was super busy, and he keptchecking in with me to assure me that my order was on its way. His taking the time to do this was so nice!!!! And then when my order was ready (which was earlier than predicted), he brought it out to me and apologized! I can't tell you how this going the extra mile made me one happy customer. Yes, they have amazing, authentic Mexican food here, but they are also sooo nice, which makes such a difference. This foodie cant say the same for some of the higher priced establishments in the area. Los Agaves has great prices for what you get!!!! I  never going anywhere else for Mexican food. I have been totheir competitor and had a totally different (negative) experience. And the bonus? I got an extra bag of chips with my order so I can have dry chips with my nacho leftovers tomorrow!!

1/30/2018,"Huntington Beach, CA","This is my favorite spot for Mexican in Santa Barbara. I always get the shrimp molcajete and the mole enchiladas for baby. I've also had the chile relleno which is excellent here. The shrimp molcajete is truly one of a kind. I literally feel like I'm eating a molting pot of lava, but the most decadent, spicy, flaming hot one that I dip tortillas in and eat with rice and beans. Not to mention it's kind of hard to find this dish anywhere else. The mole enchiladas are always yummy, I order them for my son mostly because I want to sneak a few bites. Their presentation is always impressive, and service is always outstanding. The little touches like the Spanish tile and fresh flowers on the table let me know they pay attention to detail, and I really appreciate that! This restaurant is a spitting image of what Santa Barbara life is- easy, breezy, beautiful and savory.",5 star rating,Jax V.
9/18/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Yummm! We go to the location on Milpas. I like Mexican food that's tasty but not too spicy, and my husband likes more kick. There are options for us both. They do a really good business there, but no matter how busy, the staff have always been friendly, and we've never been unable to find a seat or had to wait long for our food. I also love that I can get a side of really good grilled nopales (cactus leaf) there. If you've not had it before, the inside can be an acquired texture (a bit slimy, like okra), but it's so flavorful and Los Agaves prepares them just right, adding a chargrilled touch.

5/7/2014,"Monterey Park, CA","Went to UCSB for 4 years and I try this place after I graduated! Life's not fair. I came here with a group of my friends for lunch. They have parking in the back, but it's small and gets pretty crowded. You may end up having to park on the streets. You have to go to the register to order. They give you a number so you find your own table. We had to sit around for awhile before they brought us a side of tortilla chips. It may be better if they just give you a bag of chips when you order. We each ordered something different, but everything was delicious! I had their seafood molcajete. At the time I had bit the inside of my mouth and gave myself a canker sore. I knew I shouldn't have been eating anything acidic, but it looked and tasted way too good not to scarf it all down. Definitely recommend it if you don't know what to get.The only reason why I can't give this 5 stars is their horchata was one of the worst I ever had. I don't know if it was a bad batch or they make it differently, I just didn't like it. I will definitely be ordering a beer or a soda next time around.",4 star rating,Danny L.

4/19/2014,"Fremont, CA","The boyfriend and I were craving Mexican food and I had this place bookmarked on yelp so we decided to give it a try. Let me start off by saying that this place has an AMAZING salsa bar. What I loved most about the salsa bar was that each salsa had its own distinct flavor. We liked most of them and thought they all were fresh with lots of ingredients and a good kick to them. We got there at 7pm on a Saturday night and it was packed. Luckily when we were lined up, it wasn't out the door, but once we did, the line almost wrapped around the corner. +1 star for the amazing service. While we were waiting, the manager (or at least I assume he was) came around with a plate of chips and guacamole and offered it to the people who were waiting and thanked us for waiting. Not only that, even though it is a order, get a number, seat yourself type of restaurant, there were tons of workers walking around making sure everything was ok, which I really liked.Onto the entrees:Shrimp Molcajete 4/5: I saw all the reviews raving about this this and the pictures all looked so yummy. I love soupy things, so I thought this would be right up my alley. What I loved most about this was the SUCCULENT shrimp that was in it. They gave 6 jumbo, and I'm talking HUGE shrimp that were all perfectly cooked. They were sweet, plump, and just amazing. The molcajete was good at first, but towards the end, it got kind of tiring and too salty for my taste, BUT I am glad I tried it cause I've never heard of this dish at a Mexican joint before. Would I order it again? Not anytime soon, but I think it's definitely worth a try.Burrito Mojada with 1/2 Carne Asada and Carnitas 3.5/5: A little better than your average wet burrito. The carnitas was delicious though. Not too salty with really good flavors. Overall, I think this place is worth a try. I would definitely try the Tacos del Mar the next time I come back. PRO-TIP: Beware of coming on a weekend, be prepared to wait! Also, there's a parking lot behind the restaurant, but it fills up quickly since it's so tiny.",4 star rating,Jamie A.
6/20/2016,"Lakewood, CA","My wife and I are visiting Santa Barbara for a couple of fats and were craving some Mexican food. Looking at the name, and it just called to me.This is a strange mix of upscale with counter service Mexican food. You order at the counter and seat yourself, and they bring you the good. It was busy, but it was not hard to find a seat.I prefer more authentic Mexican food, such as my wife and her family makes, and I can definitely appreciate the balance here between more authentic, and the mass appeal approach. We had the mole enchiladas and flautitas tapatias. I usually prefer the savory style mole, but this was really good. The sauce was chocolatey sweet, but not overpowering. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and this mix worked really well. The enchiladas were also not stuffed to the brim with cheese, just a little Monterey jack. The flautitas tapatias were also really tasty, with salsa, guacamole, and crumbled queso fresco. The chicken, again was tender and delicious, the tortilla was crispy, but not too crunchy. It looks like most of the plates are served with beans and Mexican rice. The came with the crumbled queso fresco. They were pretty good, but made for too much of a meal for me after the main dishes.The salsa at this place was also amazing. I forget the name, but the tomatillo style salsa, with ground jalapenos was just the right level of spicy, and was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling up/down/right and maybe even left to Santa Barbara...",5 star rating,Dan M.
7/22/2016,"Vancouver, Canada","Imagine you've made the mistake of visiting Santa Barbara with two children who are growing up in a Mexican food-deprived city, and who are therefore unwilling to eat Mexican food of any kind -- no, not even a quesadilla! I know, kids suck.So you decide the kids are old enough to stay alone for the hour it will take for you to go to the legendary taqueria made famous by Julia Child's patronage. You give the kids a couple of bowls of noodles and unlimited access to Minecraft, and race the mile to aforementioned taqueria....only to discover that it's closed on Wednesdays. Why, God, why????Now you've got a dilemma: the clock is ticking and you have to choose another Mexican restaurant fast. Yelpers also Los Agaves, which you passed on the way over. So you stick your head in, only to be dismayed by the relatively modest array of choices on the giant chalk board over the counter where you're supposed to order.But wait...what is the nice man by the door handing you? It's a menu with EVERY Mexican dish you have ever heard of, and many you haven't. You order the Los Agaves (seafood) enchiladas, and then because you can't resist mole and aren't sure whether you'll be happy with a molcajete, you order the mole enchiladas too. You take your seat, and then remember the salsa bar...and load up on glorious salsas just as a perfect bowl of tortilla chips arrives at your table.They're followed in short order by an exquisite plate of seafood enchiladas, which come with a salad that has a dressing that tastes EXACTLY like a Creamsicle. I know that sounds like a criticism but it is actually so delicious that when I get home I am going to try melting and bottling a Creamsicle to use as salad dressing.Shortly afterwards, the mole enchiladas make their appearance...and they are just as tasty! In fact I have to stop searching my memory for the right adjectives because it's making my mouth water to think about it.As for Julia Child's taqueria...well, maybe we'll still get there. Or maybe we'll skip it, and head right back to Los Agaves for another delicious meal.  We can let the kids eat the tortilla chips...if they're worthy.",4 star rating,Alexandra S.

Milpas is: order at the counter and they bring you your food. You do not have a waiter who you continuously order from. The salsa and soda bar are self serve. If you plan on having more than one beer, you will have to time the line correctly.I ordered a Bohemia beer and ""Aranchera"" meat. Very tasty, not over cooked! The homemade tortillas were an added bonus!!The salsa bar has a great variety of flavors and heat! We ordered a side of guacamole which was also fresh and tasty!My girlfriend ordered a Dos Equis and ""Alambres""... Her chicken was very well prepared. Not dry, great flavor!

7/21/2019,"Lincoln, CA","You stand in line and once you place your order, you are seated with a number on table for food delivery...  Was pretty efficient for a busy Sunday night.  The chips and salsa were good and the guac was great.  My wife had pretty standard Mexican staple...  chicken enchiladas, rice and beans, and loved them.  I had the Chili Nortenos with house salad and rice.  The pablano chilis were fresh and tasty with a bit of heat..  they were filled with lots of shrimp, cheese and a really delicious sauce and plated on corn tortillas.  All really good, however, the chilis had a touch too much sauce and the salad had a bit too little dressing...  With very minor attention to these details, would have rated 5 stars.  For those of you looking for a bit more than basic Mexican food, Los Agaves delivers, with a nice, but not over the top or pretentious ambiance...  If you are near Santa Barbara, this is definately worth your time and money.",4 star rating,Steve P.

4/8/2014,"Aliso Viejo, CA","I am afraid I am going to review this place against the majority of my fellow yelpers... This place was not that good in my opinion. We were visiting SB for a day and decided to try this place out based on the great yelp reviews. We ordered a Agave burrito and a queso Fundido dish. The agave burrito was literally swimming in the sauce. The queso fundido was very greasy. It came with 3 small tortilla wraps. When we asked for more a rude employee said that we have to pay $1.65 more to get some more. I mean seriously?!!! Did you see howmuch we originally spent in the first place?! Giving away 3 tortillas is not gonna make the owners go broke but it definately made us upset and put us in a bad mood... He could have been less rude about it and not argue with us!For this reason, I will not go back to this place and I will for sure let everyone around me know of how greedy the owner is...",1 star rating,Yasaman J.
4/22/2016,"Oakland, CA","WOW. Never had Mexican food quite like this before, and what I mean by that is the list of options (tons!) and the flavors, oh the flavors!Salsa bar is as amazing as folks say, but sadly just has piles of plastic containers for people to fill. I placed all mine on my plate so I'd have less plastic to throw away (they give you plasticware for ""glasses"" and it's annoying).I had the cheesiest, most crazy-creamiest enchiladas. I think it was a 3000-calorie meal and could easily be split. My partner had one single quesadilla and it was FRIED (whhhhattt?) unexpectedly but oh so delicious. That melty cheese inside, and that tempura-like crispy shell. Crazy. Never been served a fried quesadilla before. Squash blossoms inside, a nice touch.Decent atmosphere and friendly staff.Thanks to the SB local who rec'd this to us!",5 star rating,Stephanie P.
6/8/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Well I wish I could give this place 4 Stars but in reality the food was good but not to my expectations.

The cheese enchilada as well. As for the beans & rice, yes those were good. So overall I can say the food was alright but just not to what I expected.",3 star rating,Adriana M.

6/16/2014,"Los Angeles, CA",What can I say about the food here. Hmmm well it's the real deal! I posted a status and tagged my location on Facebook at the Santa Barbara zoo and a friend recommended I check out los agaves which isn't to far from the zoo. So on his recommendation my girlfriend and I drove over. We found parking out front and headed in. The place is much larger than it looks from the outside. We looked up at the menu and my eyes immediately saw the ceviche and I was sold. I mean come on we are right here by the beach and it was a nice 78° outside so ceviche only makes sense! My girlfriend ordered a sampler with an enchilada and tacos with rice and beans. We  headed over to the salsa bar and grabbed a few salsas and sat. We chatted for a bit and the food came out! The ceviche dish is pretty big! The chunks of halibut were huge!! And the flavor is to die for! It builds in your mouth with each bite sending your taste buds into a frenzy! I love my ceviche with a bit of tapatio and just a bit of lime!  The enchiladas and the taco my g/f got were also very delicious!

The owner Carlos is on his 4th restaurant so his brother mans the helm. My favorites are: the Enchiladas Guadalajara, great green sauce and comes with rice and beans. The Pasilla Chile Campestre which is a chilie stuffed with your choice of meat, cheese and a cilantro cream sauce on top of two fresh corn tortillas.

3/1/2014,"Westminster, CA","I don't know what to say about the kind of people who would visit such a fabulous corner of the world as Santa Barbara only to eat at chain restaurants like IHOP, when they could have fits of spastic delight over unique gourmet fare on the cheap at, say, Los Agaves, or one of a hundred other great little places along the main strips of town. But certainly, such baffling folk do exist, for so do the Winchell's, Denny's, and Panda Express blighting the real estate here. Ah, humanity, where is thy clue?So take my hand, timid traveler, and we will journey a few blocks east of State Street to a slower street in paradise, where you can afford the deliciousness that awaits you.Order at the counter, snag a table, and put up your number: from that point on, you're getting full service at this friendly little place. Better yet, you'll get served *quickly*, and you will love every bite (if my one experience with the Tampiquenas plate is anything by which to judge). That grilled meat is so tender and succulent! ..and you can tell that the tortillas are house-made, like little flat, tasty pillows of freshness and comfort. Pillows that taste like corn. MMM, resting my head upon tasty corn pillows. Delicious confusion.Now if my friend Dave O and his lovely bride would only upgrade their wedding plans to include guests outside the ""family only"" circle, I might have an excuse to spend 2.5 hours driving up the coast to visit Los Agaves for another round of Mexican perfection on a plate. I guarantee you, there will be no MexiCal food at their reception.:(",5 star rating,Anna R.

11/26/2016,"Danville, CA","I ordered the 3 steak taco combo with a side salad. They were very generous with well seasoned steak, but they each only came with one tortilla and no trimmings (onions, pico de gallo, sauce...). The plus side is they had a well stocked salsa bar with everything I could have needed. My kids split an extremely large quesadilla, which they seemed to enjoy. The downside to my salad was that it was covered in ""Mango Dressing"", which looked and tasted like custard. In addition it was topped with cranberries and mandarines. It was basically a side of dessert. I'm not sure how no one else has complained about this. It totally defeats the purpose of a salad. I'll make sure to ask for a side of vinaigrette instead of ""mango dressing"". On the plus side, the food was fresh and there were many delicious looking meals I'd love to try next time.",4 star rating,Linda S.

11/15/2014,"Montebello, CA","Iiiyyyeee  yaaa  yaaaaeeeeiiii! Coooo  cuu roo cu cooooooo! The Los Agaves burrito is muy deliciouso! What can I say?I happened to be in the Santa Barbara area for a soccer game coming from Los Angeles. A team parent invited the team to her favorite Mexican food restaurant after the game before hitting the road back home that Sunday afternoon. After reading some of the reviews I was able to convince my daughter and lovely wife to join the team for a late lunch.Let me tell you, after reading  all the great reviews there is one really bad review that really stood out to me. Someone made a special effort to really bomb on the Los Agaves burrito saying that it wasn't good and that it was drenched with Thousand Island dressing. Knowing that there are people that write reviews to be spiteful I decided to take a chance and try the Los Agaves burrito to see if there was any truth to what this guy was saying.Well, it turns out that in my opinion, the Los Agaves burrito was freakin DELICIOUS! It was served with  a beautiful salad that had craisens and tangerine with some sort of freshly made creamy dressing. It was also served with the best Spanish rice I've ever tasted which had some crumbly Mexican cheese sprinkled on top. I never knew rice could taste that good!The burrito itself was filled with deliciously grilled halibut and shrimp and I don't know what else but it was topped with some freshly made chipotle cream sauce that was filled with spice and flavor. And to top it off, it had bits of red onion and pineapple for texture, flavor and presentation purposes. The thought that ran through my mind after cleaning my plate not even leaving a morsel of evidence that some sort of beautifuly presented, deliciously tasting work of art was ever there was "" That burrito was insanely good!""Next time I'm in the Santa Barbara area I will definitely be back to try something new on their menu. I definitely recommend this restaurant. :)",5 star rating,Joe G.
4/30/2016,"Victorville, CA",I can't say this place has the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara because I haven't tried every place yet. But so far this is the best. They keep it interesting here with excellent seafood dishes and various mole combinations. I would highly recommend the agaves enchiladas or the agaves burritos. Both are coated in a mildly sweet mango sauce.For all the uniquely crafted menu items you would expect this place to be more formal. But you order at the counter. Plus prices aren't too hefty either for the quality you're getting here.  I was a little disappointed with the lack of margaritas on the drink menu. But I suppose it's so busy that it would be hard to serve them.,4 star rating,Aaron B.

2/23/2014,"Camarillo, CA",Made the mistake of coming for our first visit on a Friday at lunchtime. We wanted a nice relaxing lunch with margaritas and good Mexican food. Our visit to Los Agaves started off on a bad note.After struggling to find a table we could not find anyone to bus the table and clear off the dirty dishes. We asked five different people to clear the table for us. None came back to do it. The place was manic and hardly relaxing. My wife wanted to leave but I'd just ordered $57.00 of food. I was unhappy enough to consider it.I ordered a variety of food to try different dishes. I am extremely picky about authentic Mexican food. I have found none to measure up to my go to place in the SF valley for the last 30 years.Los Agaves was hands-down the best Mexican food we have ever eaten. Everything we ordered from nachos to fish tacos to soft tacos to al pastor to flan was amazing.We can't wait to go back. Los Agaves looks like it will become our new favorite lunch spot in Santa Barbara.,5 star rating,Fred M.

From mild to spicy all having a rich flavor.The steak nachos are enough for 4 people Seriously grilled Carne Asada with a ton of melted jack cheese , creme fresh and a very flavorful black beans Guacamole and  chopped tomatoes  WoWWe had a beer batter fish taco and a shrimp taco the fish today was halibut The piece was huge at least 2 ounces it had a really crispy batter and a slaw with pineapple and mango Really Really good. The shrimp taco was actually 3 battered shrimp probably u12 in size which are quite big.

1/25/2016,"New York, NY","I definitely do not get my fill of casual Mexican food back east, so I was stoked to come here on our last morning and get a load of well-reviewed grub before we headed for the airport. Let me first start off by saying that the portions here are gigantic(!), and that if you err on the side of ordering more food, you will end up like me - nearly keeling over from how full I was. But hey - I was about to get on an airplane for several hours, so I had to take it all down - no leftovers! We got there right when it opened at 11 AM, and even then there were several others who beat us in...a good sign that there was already decent business as soon as the doors opened on a rainy Monday. We purveyed the menus in line, as well as the specials board up top, before going with the carne asada (for her), the wet chicken burrito (for me), and a fish taco and guacamole to split. The beer selection isn't huge, but I took the Hoppy Poppy IPA when I saw it - a very pleasant IPA to sip on while chowing down my meal. There are loads of different salsas at the side (all delicious; I liked the medium-spiced tomato based one the best). Once seated, our food was brought out as it was finished, although the guacamole (thankfully) came first, along with a large helping of tortilla chips.And that's where we start this adventure - the tortilla chips were relatively light, freshly cooked from the look of the oil sheen on each chip, but it was perfect for the salsa (especially the mild salsa labeled as 'chip salsa'), and it worked very well for the guacamole too. While the guacamole didn't have as much cilantro as I'd like (I'm a bit of a cilantro fiend when it comes to making my own guacamole at home), it is still fresh and is a very generous portion for only $5. We made our way through most of it before our entrees arrived, and we recognized the scope of the task at hand. The plates are huge, and everything comes with beans and rice, along with the main course. My wife's carne asada was a thin but very well-flavored steak - not the most succulent piece of meat, but one that was very flavorful. With a couple tortillas on the side, you could definitely make your own fajita if you wanted. My burrito - well, it was eye-poppingly huge, and I got a bit full just looking at it. The chicken was great, as was the slightly hot sauce it was drenched in, and after a lot of time, I managed to pack the entire thing away. A note: this burrito is not like other burritos, where you may have lettuce or beans or salsa in it. There is a TON of grilled chicken (very good, I might add), and the sour cream, guacamole, and lettuce are on the side to add to each bite. The fish taco (which we ate before our own dishes) was excellent - such bright flavors from the chopped peppers, and the fish itself is very lightly battered, giving you the juiciness of the mahi mahi without being over-breaded.This probably facilitated our trip to the airport a little, as we were simply too stuffed to contemplate doing much else besides sitting still and letting the food digest. That said, holy cow - what a delicious meal, and I will definitely be back here if I am in town again. Excellent authentic Mexican cuisine at a great price - what more could one ask for?",5 star rating,Asuka N.

But i think i still can have this more. So delicious Id recommend this place.,5 star rating,Soo K.
1/31/2014,"Oxnard, CA","Los Agaves is my favorite restaurant of all  time. Not only is the food delicious but the service is always friendly. I was very thankful to find this place, best authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara. For first timers I recommend the tampiqueña, it gives you a taste of the wonderfulness that they offer. I always ask for them to substitute the enchilada sauce to mole, which is done right (not sweet, rich in flavor, with a tiny kick). It is a big plate, and the price is more than fair.Also their aguas(horchata & jamaica) are delicious (everything is) and home made, nothing artificial. Great place, excellent food!!",5 star rating,Ximena B.

4/5/2014,"San Francisco, CA","We came here after looking at the reviews online and pretty much drooling over the molcajete.  The land and sea Molcajete was, in fact, amazing and everyone else walking by my table kept asking me about it.  Unfortunately, it was hard to answer them as my mouth was continually full of great flavored steak, fish, and shrimp.  The entrees were large for the price point, and we had to take home half of both entrees that we ordered.  We were able to eat the leftovers for dinner, so it really was quite a bargain. They also give you free chips and have an extensive help yourself salsa bar - but we warned not to eat too many chips before your entree comes!",5 star rating,Janet Z.

9/14/2016,"Fullerton, CA","When I came here on Saturday night, the place was packed!!I had to wait in line, but it moved pretty fast.We ordered fish and shrimp tacos, carne asada nachos, and the beef burrito for 3 people, and we couldn't finish it all although we were all starving.Also they give you complimentary nachos when you order. Yeah, that's why we had too much food.I really liked the sauce bar there. They had all different kinds of sauces available, and they also had jalapeños, cilantro, onions, and et cetra.If I am to go to Santa Barbara again, I would definitely visit this place again!",5 star rating,Sunny W.
6/5/2019,"New York, NY","If I could only use one word it would be WOW. I am from NYC where we have mediocre, at best, Mexican food. Two different friends  recommended Los Agaves (one specifically this location)  and so did the yelp weekly roundup. I was deterred by the fact that you order at the counter, but the super helpful and sweet counter person hooked me with the free chips and salsa bar. I love me some condiments and they have at least 6 different (and delicious) varieties of salsa PLUS jalapeños, lime, cilantro and onions. Once you order and help yourself to salsa they bring everything (including the chips ) to your table. The service was attentive, friendly and QUICK! My fiancé is vegetarian and in NYC we are so used to lackluster vegetarian Mexican food (way too much jack cheese and way too little flavor) but the menu was so expansive and flavorful that I did not feel the need to order meat, instead we split 3 dishes and guacamole (the guacamole was listed as ""market price"", I don't remember what the price ended up being, but as a fellow food business owner I found it sort of cute and endearing , avocados can be so flipping expensive!!!). The squash blossom quesadilla was flavorful and HUGE (only $6) the tacos we ordered were filled with charred peppers and cheese and so flavorful )probably my favorite dish. We got a stuffed pepper which I was very skeptical about because we subbed veggies for meat and at most Mexican restaurants that means soggy, stringy, unidentifiable And very oily veggies, but these veggies were grilled to perfection and so fresh. If you're in SB and want quality Mexican come here! Our whole bill was $46 and we are both so stuffed (but not the gross food kind of stuffed ) and have leftovers!!!",5 star rating,Janie D.
12/22/2015,"Fallbrook, CA","While visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend my family and I turned to Yelp for great restaurants in the area. We found Los Agaves and after seeing how high their rating was (And how many had reviewed it!) we thought we'd give it a try.We got there after lunch time (Maybe 3:00PM or so) and it was really crowded considering it was past lunch time. Immediately as you enter you walk up and see a giant board with their daily specials. I assumed that was all they had, but up walked a staff member with a menu. They have a huge menu! I was overwhelmed with all their choices and as there weren't really places to sit, I hurried and picked something as you order/pay at the register. After ordering my family and I were able to find a table, but everything after here just went wrong. Immediately my boyfriend got his food, but no one else did. They did bring out food that was supposed to be for me, but it was the wrong order so they took it back to fix it. 2 other tables next to us had wrong orders sent to their tables as well. 5 minutes later my dad got his. 15 minutes went by and my mom and I had still not gotten any food. Within this time, 3 staff members came up asking us if they could take our # sign to indicate we had gotten our food, which we said we hadn't and they all looked confused and would try and see when our food was ready. They never came back to let us know. It was only when the 4th staff member came by that he checked on our food, and out came my moms food (He really tried his best to help, which we really appreciated). 5 minutes later, he came by with free guacamole (Which was a nice gesture, but everyone except me were already full). Still no food for me at this point either. By this time my boyfriend had already finished his food and my dad was almost done. Finally I got my food, but at this point I didn't really care anymore as almost everyone had finished their food. I had ordered the Plato placero de arrachera (Build your own taco!) and it tasted pretty good. I enjoyed the tortillas and it was good steak. It was just a shame that I ate after everyone had already finished their food. A few hours after having eaten their food I had the worst stomach pains and so did my boyfriend (Who had also eaten my food). With how bad their service was, not getting our food & the food making us sick, I will not be returning.",1 star rating,Kelly J.
1/25/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","First stop in Santa Barbara since we heard this place serves some awesome Mexican food!Chicken tostada salad ($11) - best part of this salad was the avocado, sour cream  and the refried beans (yes, all the naughty stuff!) Basic tostada salad with mixed greens, avocado, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, grilled chicken all piled into a friend tostada bowl. Chicken was seasoned lightly and grilled. Not spectacular, but no complaints from me!Burrito Mojado ($9) - this was a wet burrito with grilled steak and pinto beans, topped with cheese and salsa roja. I thought the burrito was a bit underwhelming - especially with the meat being a bit chewy. The tiny salad and rice was nice to have!Great portion size. Delicious salsa bar (VERY SPICY!). Bowl of fresh chips on the house. Clean restaurant + cute decor. A great place to grab some Mexican food, but nothing to write home about.Tiny parking lot - but plenty of street parking!",3 star rating,Eunice K.

2/27/2017,"Venice, CA","Highly recommend. Portions are huge so expect leftovers or come with a large appetite. You have to order at the front which I'm not the biggest fan of but it wasn't too busy so I didn't mind it. We ordered nachos, chicken enchiladas suiza, and beef chimichangas. All meals come with free chips. There's a salsa station to the right of where you place your order ranging from mild to hot. The guy who took our order also brought us our food. Everything was cooked perfectly. Great flavors. I've lived in California for about 6 months now and this place is on the top of my list.",5 star rating,Rachel F.

1/9/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for a job yesterday and decided to check this place out for lunch. La super rica taqueria was closed for the day. Just a few blocks up is this place, with nice interiors, really epitomizing the California feel with the Spanish tiles, open airy seating, bright colors. It was all very lovely.  We ordered the wet steak burrito and the special, gringa al pastor and two horchatas. Salsa bar was fresh and plentiful. The pico de gallo and salsa verde were my favorites, though the pico de gallo was way spicy! It burned my mouth after a while. The horchata was a little too milky for my liking. Wish there was a bit more cinnamon in there. My burrito was pretty standard, nothing too amazing. Good quality meat and it was really filling. It came with rice, guac and sour cream as well. My hub's al pastor special, which was like a quesadilla with pork chunks and pineapple was really delicious. We were stuffed by the time we finished. Huge portions with good prices.Definitely will be coming back to this restaurant next time we're in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Leona S.
1/22/2014,"San Mateo, CA","So, I ordered the infamous shrimp and fish enchilada and he got the big burrito.  To start, this menu didn't have the generic samplings which all other restaurants have.  Reminded me of a Quaxacin style with different sauces and meat/seafood choices.  Actually a lot of seafood.  Both of our dishes were so unexpectedly great, even when I was hesitant about craving fish that evening.  Wow, the sauce on the enchilada was so good.  The rice - mmmah (with the fingers to the mouth, Italian style) - so so good.  Finally a Mexican restaurant that can make really great rice.  Even their mango salad dressing was unexpectedly fitting. However, everyone raved of the salsa bar, and I have definitely seen and tasted better.  I couldn't find the perfect medium red salsa.   The chips - I've had better for sure.  So this rating is of the entree choices itself.  The line will be out the door in the evening, but it goes by quickly.  Once you order, find a server and they will assist with finding you a seat for your party.  Enjoy.  I want to go back to try their sea and sand salsa stew.  Note - no margaritas!!  They must start making some.",5 star rating,Candice H.
9/3/2015,"Irvine, CA","Los Agaves is a Santa Barbara must! At rush meal hours, the line is often out the door, but the wait is definitely worth it. The line moves relatively fast and you can always take your food to go if the tables are full!My favorite thing on the menu is the tostada salad. It's crazy delicious. What's better than getting a salad, but also being able to eat the bowl? The dressing the tostada comes with is to die for. I highly recommend ordering the steak tostada--something about Los Agaves' steak just gets me going--and substituting pinto beans for black beans. Don't forget to try their salsa bar. Los Agaves has some seriously delicious salsas to be discovered.",4 star rating,Margie M.

The salad is served inside a large tostada shell, thus the name! You can also order the salad without the shell if you don't like the tostada, but then it is just a salad that shouldn't be called a tostada salad (LOL) but it is still an option for you people. The fish and shrimp tacos are good too...My favorite though is Rajas. Get them.",5 star rating,Anabella L.

12/26/2015,"San Francisco, CA","Great Mexican food, definitely recommend stopping by if you're in town. Be careful from the yellow peppers, I had something that looked like a habanero and my mouth is still burning--the locals called it chilipenio. Get a cup for water when you make your order, you're going to need it.The place is busy and usually packed, even after lunch hours--we went there around 3 on Saturday and had to wait in line for about 10 minutes. Finding a table was a little bit of an adventure, but we got a good seat next to the window. The guacamole doesn't have any tomatoes, but you can get some mixed tomatoes and onions from the garnish stand and mixed them together.Wish it was closer to the beach and State st.

6/21/2014,"Seattle, WA","This is a place where you order at a counter, take a number, and look for an empty table to sit down at with your group.  If you're lucky, you'll find one.  This place is so popular that it seems like it's almost always packed.  When we went, on a Saturday early evening around 6pm, there was a line out the door just for ordering at the counter.The unlimited salsa bar is fabulous, and the guacamole (which comes as a side to many entrees) is delicious as well.  We enjoyed a huge, heaping plate of nachos as a starter.  They were pretty tasty.  As my entree I had one of their specials, the Cochinita Pibil, which is a slow-cooked pulled pork dish in a spicy habanero-based sauce.  Although the sauce was super spicy and delicious, I found it too be just a bit too salty, and the pork was absolutely drenched in the sauce.  Adding a bit of rice, sour cream, and guac to the corn tortillas when wrapping up the pork helped, and overall I was able to enjoy the dish for what it was worth.  I think it could have been amazing, though, if they had toned down the salt.The tortillas, side fixins, and service were all highly characteristic of a very authentic mexican joint.  I would definitely return the next time I'm in Santa Barbara, but I think I'll get a different entree next time.",4 star rating,Ran L.
12/14/2015,"Irvine, CA","As the reviews state, amazing food. We came on a Monday night at about 6:30 and our only issue was the parking. Plenty of room, no wait, and a wide selection of excellent dishes. We got the enchilada suizas and the pork tamales and split them between 2 of us.  The enchilada was filled with white meat chicken, and the tamales was almost overflowing with delicious pork.  Salsas were ""bomb"", as someone else specified. And everything was about as perfect as it gets.The margarita was weeks authentic tasting also, and we had someone check on us at least 5 times to see if we needed anything. Thanks for the amazing meal.",5 star rating,Greg R.

We live in Los Angeles and even-though I am not Mexican, I have been exposed to some really good Mexican food in my area over the years. The food is really good and it offers some dishes that is not common, or at least I am not familiar with. I ordered the lengua chili verde and I love how spicy it was. My husband's mole burrito is also one of the better ones that I have tasted but I have had slightly  better to ones in the LA area. My children's chicken and beef taco was so-so though.

10/20/2015,"San Luis Obispo, CA","Outstanding authentic Mexican cuisine with a flare for seafood. An extensive menu boosts something for even the pickiest eater. The Queso Fundido appetizer is amazing for you (us) cheese lovers! They have a few dishes I was not familiar with but tasted absolutely tantalizing: Molcajetes with grilled nopal, panela chorizo (not w/ vegetarian), grilled cambray onion, avocado and home made salsa choice of chicken, shrimp, land and sea, rib eye, arrachera or veggie. The nopals really made this dish exquisite! Their basic carne asada dish was a very decent quality cut of ny strip cooked to your liking. The daily specials, Los Agaves Specials, one of which I didn't get to try but would consider going back for: Caldo Siete Mares which is a seafood stew with shrimp, halibut, clams, prawns, veggies, avocados & tortillas. And there's at least 5 other items I'd have to try. Their newest location just opened on Westlake Blvd in Thousand Oaks! Not cheap but this ain't no taco stand!!!",5 star rating,Heather J.
11/27/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","If you're in Santa Barbara and looking for some awesome Mexican food, then Los Agaves is the best to be! My party and I arrived on a Saturday night around 7pm. There was no line at that time, but after we ordered, a many hungry human beings began forming a line. So, be warned that there could be a wait. Upon ordering, I found that they operate like a fast food restaurant where you place the order, pay, find a table, and have the food delivered to your party. However, the ambiance and quality of the food was not fast food standards. As I mentioned to someone, the food reminded me of authentic Mexican food, without the grease. The prices are decent, but the portions make it all worthwhile. For food, we ordered the guacamole, combination plate (beef sope, beef crispy tacos, beef soft tacos, and enchilada), and chicken and cheese quesadilla. All were very delicious! The service was quick and the restaurant was clean. Thumbs up to this place.",5 star rating,Ricky S.
5/9/2019,"Costa Mesa, CA","The food is excellent with a fantastically diverse menu. Just ask the owner what is best and you can't go wrong. People who keep talking about the salsa bar are missing the real food which is the entrees which don't need a drop of salsa because the food is so good.  They have, steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops and fish. The price averages about $12 a plate but well worth it in taste a proportions.",5 star rating,Jesse P.
8/26/2014,"Burbank, CA","Some of the best Mexican food we've had in a long time. This place was just excellent. I have nothing bad to say. For starters, they've got their system down. We were there for the lunchtime rush, but the wait was reasonable and we got a table easily enough. The prices aren't low, for Mexican, but the food is worth every penny. The staff is also very pleasant and helpful. We got the nachos and each combination patters.

Haha The tacos had a little too much pineapple for my taste in tacos, but it was still delicious. I'd recommend this as a cool lunch spot because of the fact that you order your food and then get a table. It's a laid back vibe but the food runners were on point. Everything came out promptly and it was delicious. They also had a salsa bar and I never turn down a pick de gallo and a cilantro/lime/jalapeño salsa.

3/8/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Extremely disappointed in one of my favorite SB establishments. My roommates and I consistently order take out from this Los Agaves location 2-3 times per week, with very consistent orders each time. Lately our orders have had small mistakes in them, never enough to deter us though from the delicious food made here. Although this most recent order was enough to speak up. Being its Friday during lent, I'm unable to eat meat. I ordered a shrimp burrito mojado, was charged for a shrimp burrito mojado, but was given chicken that I am unable to now eat entirely. We also ordered fajitas del mar, with only shrimp, as one of us is allergic to fish. Fish was mixed into the fajitas and now this order is contaminated and inedible due to sever allergic reactions. Being that it was extremely loud and very tough to hear clearly on their phones, we asked to have the order verbally repeated, which was repeated 100% correct. The breakdown in communication from order to the line has now caused 2 inedible meals that were grossly overcharged considering chicken was provided in an item that shrimp was ordered. We just ask that these comments are used as coaching opportunities for Los Agaves employees, and to be more considerate and conscious of a customer's phone order. Customers may have just been lost.",1 star rating,Mike A.

11/22/2017,"San Jose, CA","If I could, I'd give this place two and a half stars. We were disappointed given the multiple recommendations from locals to check this place out. This is a counter order place- no problem for us, but we began our order only to find that many of the menu items were sold out. They didn't have any pork at all, no micheladas, and one of the beers was sold out. And there were quite a few other things that they didn't have. Then when we asked what type of tequila they use as my husband has an allergy to Cuervo,  we came to find out that their margaritas even though advertised as margaritas, don't even contain tequila! Had I not asked, we would've found ourselves with a agave wine margaritas - not what we had in mind. I will say the food was decent- but nothing to write home about. My husband did love his mole enchilada. Also, one server was very helpful and friendly, but the woman taking our order seemed confused when we asked questions. I get the sense this is a great spot that was having an off night, but no way to be sure.",3 star rating,Kirsten M.
1/15/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I've eaten at Milpas location for years. Salsa bar great and my fave, the mild, is perfect. Tried De la Vina locale 3 times.

4/15/2018,"Fort Myers, FL","Just got to the area and read reviews. Decided to try it out and was extremely satisfied. The menu is expansive, and they also have daily specials on a LCD screen at the register. This is a quick service style restaurant, with table delivery. I have been to many restaurants of this type and I must say the service was amazing. As for the food, I haven't had better. I want to move across the street so that I can eat here daily. They also had gluten free options on the menu which was great for my wife. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area.",5 star rating,Stephan D.
6/8/2016,"Santa Paula, CA","After reading the reviews on Yelp and looking at the pictures, we decided to stop by for lunch at noon on a Tuesday. Took us about 10 minutes to find parking alone but we did and didn't mind the walk. We were lucky to beat the lunch mob.. Really! We were 3rd in line and found a table quickly after ordering, while waiting for our food the line grew out the door around the building. Service is quick, maybe 5 minutes from when you order & pay your food comes to the table, just enough time to get your drinks and salsa. My husbands order was wrong as he ordered the 3 item combo plain yet they put cheese on the rice, I pointed this out to one of the servers and he quickly fixed it and brought out a fresh plate made right .They do bring you chips to enjoy with the variety of salsas from the salsa bar and the portions are huge! My husband couldn't even finish his plate. I had the enchilada stuffed with huge shrimp, halibut and cheese covered in a creamy chipotle sauce, side of rice and a tropical green salad. It was amazing! So good and tasty. I recommend the horchata it was perfect not gritty and they do not add ice so it was creamy and not to sweet. As for price not too bad considering the huge portions, lunch for 2 and 2 drinks came to $30.I'll definitely be back!",4 star rating,Debbie G.
9/14/2013,"Diamond Bar, CA","Best mexican restaurant in SB. It's not really a fast-food type mexican place like Lilly's tacos. The serving are large and there are so many sauces and sides available!After you order in the front and find a place to sit, a waiter comes and gives you tortilla chips while you're waiting for your food. These chips cannot be store-bought because they're sooo crunchy and so much healthier.They serve you the food and most of the dishes come with side salads..SO GOOD.I got the agaves burrito.. HEAVEN. Its not your ordinary burrito, they cover it with their special sauce! came with rice and salad on the side. The salad has a sweet topping to it with mangos! The rice is cooked to perfection!Next time I came I got the halibut tacos..ughh so good. Fish was so succulent and the tortilla was so soft and delicious!Each dish is about 10-15 bucks so it's alright, and theres many dishes to choose from..

12/10/2015,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA","This place is bomb!  It throws away the Mexican food stereotypes (i.e. a place only serves burritos, tacos, and quesadillas) and shows you the other finer aspects of Mexican food.  I had split the chile relleno and shrimp enchiladas with a friend and these are to die for!  The salads come with good dressing and diced mangos, which I loved as well.I've heard lines can be long but we went on a Wednesday at 5pm and there was no line.  I'm not really up in SB a lot, but this beats out most places in LA!  The place looks like it recently expanded inside, although I'm not sure on the parking situation in SB - seems like it can get pretty frustrating trying to find street parking.",5 star rating,Geoffrey G.

12/16/2017,"Nashville, TN","Best Mexican food restaurant! My family and I have a favorite that is much farther away and closer to Los Angeles. But, Los Agaves offers the best enchiladas I've had - their house special with shrimp and white fish, which comes with a side salad that has a mango dressing: Heavenly dish.I ordered the chicken nachos so we could share plates, but, we ended up most of our own dishes. The nachos were the best I've had.They also serve horchata and it was so good. The verde salsa was my favorite. The only minor disappointment, was the roasted salsa. Not a big deal at all. The ambience is nice and also casual. It's a beautiful building/space, too. Friendly staff and we didn't have to wait long for our food. Of course, we did have a late lunch. I'm going to assume it gets fairly busy during peak meal times.The reviews didn't lie!

1/7/2018,"Riverside, CA","Delicious Mexican food! When we got there I was looking for a hostess, but it turns out that you find your own table and order your meal at the register in the front. So it's pretty casual, but everything else feels more like a restaurant. The prices were more like restaurant prices too. The food was great! I got a combination plate so I can try a variation of things. Everything was delicious, and the rest of my party agreed. Also, the service there was great! It can get very busy and since there aren't any ""waiters"" I was surprise how great the service was. There were two young guys when I went and they were just on it and took care of our every need.

Chips and tortillas were light and homemade! Mocajetes ""land and sea"" was amazing. My husband absolutely loved it! The chile nortenios were amazing! Shrimp was cooked perfect. And I thought the zucchini flower quesadilla sounded interesting so I bought that too and it was amazing. Everything was amazing. This place hands down... My new favorite restaurant.

4/1/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Awesome place to get Mexican food in town. Their Burrito Mojado is to die for, and free chips offered for dine-in customers are always great to chow on before the meal arrives. The restaurant is incredibly busy on Friday/Saturday nights, and seating is often times hard to come by. It's a grab a menu, order your food, find a seat kind of place. A nice touch is that on really busy nights, a server will usually keep track of who got there first and help out customers find seating.The salsa bar is great and the ingredients always taste very fresh. The pico de gallo here is great and I'm addicted to it. Very flavorful, reasonably priced, and large portions sum up my review of this place. I've never left unsatisfied.",5 star rating,Jae C.

We're pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, but everything we ordered had great flavor. We tried the enchiladas with the green sauce, cheese enchiladas, and the green chili pepper thing stuffed with shrimp and cheese (forgot the name) and we enjoyed all of it. The rice was very good, and they have about 6 different salsas you can choose from- nice variety! The place was pretty packed. We'd go back.",4 star rating,Jen B.

I expected AMAZE-BALLS deliciousness but ..meh... All the dishes were ""alright"" nothing crazy.So compared to all the buzz with ""1,500+"" reviews for 4.5 solid stars, it was a little disappointing. And not cheap either, 3 dishes & horchata was $44, granted portions were huge.Salsa bar with gracious large sauce cups was legit and the reason why this place is getting 3 stars instead of 1 or 2Beginning to think SB doesn't know how to do Mexican well if this is the highest rated & most reviewed in the city",3 star rating,Mick B.

10/2/2015,"Sacramento, CA","First, the food was delicious. My husband had the steak fajitas and said they were the best he ever had. The seasonings were perfect and the veggies were cooked perfectly. I had the steak mojado burrito and it was really good.  Steak was tender and tasted great. They serve the guacamole, sour cream, onions, and lettuce on the side rather than inside the burrito, so it's just a huge burrito of steak covered in red sauce and I ate it with a knife & fork! Second, it was served extremely fast.  We ordered, got our drinks, saved a table, went to the salsa bar, and by the time we came back, our food was served. Literally, at our table within five minutes. Finally, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though you place your order at the counter and sit at any table you like, they still come over to check on how you're doing. Very nice.",5 star rating,Gayle O.

Anyway I would wait in line for hours to eat this amazing food again so that's beside the point.  That salsa bar is worth the hype.  Just take that and run with it.  I got the Agaves Enchiladas which had halibut and shrimp with rice and a salad.  Um HELLO.  Who on earth can put seafood with cheese and have it be mind-blowingly good? Apparently this place because I was terrified of what I had ordered, but I have literally been tossing and turning in bed all the nights since having this meal.  That's a game changer.  Life changer? Probably.  And husband keeps saying (days later) ""that food was so good. Remember?""

Everything was pretty good about this dish.The Molcajete was made very well. I had mine with all the meats and seafood. It came with what seemed like homemade tortillas. All the meat and seafood tasted good in the sauce. The sauce had plenty of flavor. No complaints.Salsa bar was impressive with six salsas or more to choose from as well as cilantro and limes. The horchata was probably the best I've had.,4 star rating,Peter T.

8/9/2013,"Dublin, CA","I was trying to find some yummy mexican food in santa barbara, and this place popped up. We came in around 3 pm so it wasn't that crowded. My friend and I split the agave enchiladas with halibut shrimp, rice, and a mango dressing salad.  It came with a sweet, tangy, creamy chipotle sauce.  The sauce was so good I ate it with the chips that they provided. The salsa bar here is ridiculous.  The extra hot salsa was SO SPICY I LOVED IT.  I've never had such spicy salsa in my life, it was so spicy that I had to take breaks from eating it, because I couldn't really taste anything else I ate after that.  Luckily I had horchata to wash it down. This restaurant is a bit pricey for mexican food, but the quality and freshness of ingredients is worth the few extra bucks.   My mouth is watering thinking about their spicy salsa....",5 star rating,Tiffany Y.
2/2/2018,"Santa Clarita, CA",This place has amazing quac and their enchiladas are delicious.

7/2/2013,"Ventura, CA","As if this place needs another review (574 so far), but I'll add my two cents anyways.After much mental anguish deciding which of the many delicious sounding plates I wanted for dinner, I selected the Chile Norteño plate which included two large peppers stuffed with jumbo shrimp & cheese, a side of rice, and a side salad. All were very good, but the side salad was so delicious that I almost wished I had ordered a full-sized entree.The restaurant may be a little pricey with the average plate topping $13, and it may be somewhat of a hassle to stand in line to order, but the food quality is outstanding and the staff is very helpful & friendly. The extensive salsa bar is the best I've ever sampled, too.Truthfully, I can't think of a better Mexican restaurant, so we'll definitely be back to sample other dishes.",5 star rating,Jack F.

8/23/2017,"London, United Kingdom","Undeniably the best Mexican food I have had in the country - omg the salsa bar is where found happiness and got my money's worth; even before our entrees were served. Unlike typical restaurants, as soon as you enter you wait in line to order and then they seat you while your food is being prepped. I was concerned with the lack of veggie options but to my relief they agreed to make veggie enchiladas, my partner got them with meat. We almost missed the salsa bar, the host pointed it out to us saying ""you don't want to miss out on our salsas!"". We were given a table almost instantly and served a basket of fresh chips. We decided to try all salsas and LOVED each one of them so much it made us forget about our entrees ! Inspire of being full with the chips, we stuffed ourselves with the enchiladas because it seemed like a crime to not enjoy the privilege we were served on a platter. Everything on the plate - rice, beans, salsa and pico de gallo was perfect. As ofcourse, were the enchiladas. Tip - it's not a fine dining restaurant, has a very casual taqueria vibe but the food triumphs any flaws with the restaurant that you will manage to find.",5 star rating,Reema B.
11/5/2013,"San Jose, CA","Yes, definitely a fan.The only reason it's not a 5 is that I wasn't a huge fan of the baja shrimp breading or the sweetness of the al pastor, BUT....everyone in the staff was super friendly, even got a tour to show us the other dining rooms upon walking in. It is not a hole in the wall, but the food is legit. Was scared it would be gringo-fied, but it was not with the exception of the coleslaw on the shrimp tacos, and by the way, the shrimp taco came with 3 big-a$$ shrimp/prawns, not stingy at all, you literally had to take 2 of the 3 out to take a bite or eat with a fork.Food was fresh and al pastor was in huge chunks and not grisly or fatty, nice and juicy. Salsa and chips were fresh and delicious. Rice was super good, never really care about rice, but wow theirs is flavorful, fluffy and tender!Boyfriend's chimichanga, the best I've ever had, also not typically a fan of chimichanga's but if their burritos taste that good, wow I should've ordered one, it was sooo tasty. Tacos were humungous, should not have ordered 3, should have ordered 1. Prices, higher, but definitely reasonable, when portions taken into account.

Also the staff and I believe he was the owner, were extremely nice and attentive. Would definitely return whenever I'm in the area.Note: I ordered the steak picado and my bf ordered a seasonal menu item of seafood empanadas. We both ate twice because the portions were so big!Thank you for treating your customers right!:)",5 star rating,Melissa M.
4/24/2018,"Santa Ynez, CA",this is the best place for authentic mexican food. The chips to start off are freshly made and are warm. The beef taquitos dorados are really good for a simple dish. The staff is always friendly and pay lots of attention to each customer.,5 star rating,Mary J.
4/23/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Excellent food. Taco Tuesday and their crunchy tacos (beef or chicken) are a must try. Salsa bar is top notch with tons of variety. Oh and free chips! I like to avoid the crowd, as it's a popular spot, and can get crowded. Only negative thing I have to say is that maybe 1 out of 5 visits they get my order wrong in some way.",4 star rating,Brian A.
3/5/2018,"New York, NY","Excellent, authentic food. A fantastic menu, good price and being just down the road from La Super-Rica Taqueria it stands up well to this staple of Santa Barbara.

5/25/2015,"Santa Ana, CA","I typically don't take time out to write a positive review because - well I acknowledge I have very high standards, and it's rare for them to warrant anything above a three and waste my time with a review. A three to me means a business is satisfactory and I would most likely come again.  During my visit to Santa Barbara, it's always challenging to find a good meal for an affordable price.   Enter Los Agaves - Where has this gem been hiding all my life??? I got the agaves burrito, which has shrimp and fish, and is wet. I opted for a second helping of house salad instead of the rice and beans, and man was I not dissapointed (neither was my wallet).  The burrito was a beautiful marriage of seafood with hints of the guac and cheese, with a creamy spicey sauce.  The salad dressing was creamy yet citrusy, with a kick.  I could have second helping right now, except I wasn't hungry to begin with, my wife made me eat early! Bottom line, this place is off the hook. I just found my new spot when I'm in town.",5 star rating,Ray T.
7/6/2013,"Long Beach, CA","Discovering Los Agaves is exactly the reason that I love Yelp so damn much.  While on a drive to the Central Coast from Los Angeles, my best friend and I had a hankering for good Mexican.  Since I wasn't driving, I started Yelping and soon discovered Los Agaves in SB.  Boy am I glad that I did.  Delicious!  Now, I have a fabulous new spot if I'm giving someone the penny tour of SB (and I'm not so starved that I can make it past Spencer MacKenzie's in Ventura :) ....The salsa bar alone at Los Agaves is fantastic with a wide, wide variety of freshly made salsas touching every inch of the heat spectrum.  The salmon tacos were stunning and savory (my single only opportunity for improvement:  I just wish the salmon had some fresh lime to add a needed touch of acid).  The rice which accompanied our tacos was perfectly cooked and the side salad was damn near perfect.  YUM. The Los Agaves Salad was equally compellingly delicious.  I would stop at Los Agaves again in a heartbeat.",5 star rating,Stephen S.
10/8/2015,"Moreno Valley, CA","Great Mexican food there is in Santa Barbara. I highly recommend this restaurant not only for their delicious entrées but for such speedy service. It's not your typical sit down and order restaurant. You stand in line (which does gets pretty long) and order your food and they hand you a number and then you take a seat. I ordered a combination plate; enchilada, hard shell taco and chile relleno. It was very good and the chicken was very well seasoned and juicy, not like some other places where they over cook the chicken and it's gets dry.. the black beans very flavorful..loved how they sprinkled all that cheese lol..",4 star rating,Francis G.

9/16/2013,"Santa Maria, CA","Los Agaves serves the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara. They now have two locations, my visits have been to the Milpas location. Not much parking, I had to park in the neighborhood and walk to the restaurant. The service is different from the traditional restaurant in that you order food and then sit down (counter ordering). Once seated they will bring you chips, there is a salsa bar where you can help yourself. On my last visit I ordered the Chile Verde Burrito-served with rice, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Very filling, fresh and the chile verde was delicious. I chased it down with a horchata, best I ever had. Service was fast and friendly. Very fresh gourmet style Mexican food. Highly recommend..",5 star rating,Joe C.
8/18/2016,"Corona, CA","They gave us a dish, topped with only the ""finest"" tough, rubbery shrimp. It was so rubbery in fact, that I was worried if it would get me sick. But that wasn't the worst of it. All that the salad seemed to have had was 3 underripe pineapple slices, 3 slimy cucumber slices, and the rest of it? JUST PURE ONION COVERED IN BLENDED AVOCADO! Oh and the overpriced soup was nasty. It was topped with a grossly browned and over cooked broccoli, flavorless meat balls, and a whole corn on the cob...and the broth wasn't impressive either. It tasted like it could pass for a cheap progresso soup from the 99 cent store - it was 13 dollars. It defiantly was not fresh.They gave us 3 tortillas to go with 30$ ""worth"" of food. When we asked for 3 more, the unfriendly waiter said it was an extra 2.19$.To be fair, their salsa bar was delicious.",1 star rating,Madeleine M.
4/14/2019,"Woodland Hills, CA",The only thing I can say that is negative about this restaurant is that there is always a line of people waiting to get to the cashier to order and most if not all of the tables are full.

9/4/2013,"Diamond Bar, CA","Los Agaves... More like Los delicious.  The only downside, i would have to say, is the parking. But after a meal like this you could use a stroll down a block or two. The restaurant size is small but quaint. Ordering is not complicated but selecting 1Item out of an array of delicious options is a little overwhelming. We ordered the following; Nachos (no meat), steak burrito & enchiladas suisia & (my favorite) homemade horchata  After ordering we found a open table right away, put our drinks down and headed over to the salsa bar. Amazing seletion of salsa in all colors and spice levels. Got chips right away.. But told our server we wouldn't need them since we got nachos. He told us to keep them anyway. Food came within 10 mins of ordering. First thing I did.. Take a picture. Second.. Take a bite. It's not everyday  Mexican food looks gourmet without tasting white washed. Food portion was huge! We actually took Half of both our dishes home.  My enchiladas had chicken and Swiss cheese. Soooooooo cheesy. His burrito didn't look like it would get a dent! Steak was tasty and covered in red salsa. The nachos were amazing! Wish every place had nachos like there's.All together delicious!",5 star rating,Judee G.

I can't remember that name as easily, forgive me!). The portions were pretty sizable and everything was really fresh. I decided to look for a table since I was served my horchata while my friend went to get her ice tea. When she got back, she had a twinkle in her eyes and asked ""did you see the salsa bar?"" I had not, but when I looked I saw why!They had about 6 different salsas, all of which were tasty! We had read that it gets crowded and strategically got there around 2:30pm.

The customer service is also excellent.  It's self serve seating,  take a number sign with you type service.

They do a great job of creating unique flavors to traditional mexican dishes. If you are craving a flavorful meal, you MUST go to Los Agaves. I have never been disappointed by anything on their menu. I especially love anything with their chipotle sauce. I must warn you, during rush hours (lunch or dinner), there is a long line. Don't let the line deter you! It is worth the wait!

12/31/2018,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","The food was very good, excellent presentation and taste. That's why I'm giving them any stars at all. Customer service was remote from even being bad. They were extremely unorganized. 3 of my food choices they had ran out of at 2:00 pm in the afternoon. My fourth choice for a meal was available. My party was of 5, thus 5 meals and one appetizer. 4 of our plates came to the table in about 10 minutes except for the cazuela poblana meal and the appetizer. Which was brought to the waiters attention and his response was let me check on that for you. He never came back with an update. After another ten minutes I requested to speak with a manager and the waiter goes to call to manager and comes back within s minute and tells me I'm sorry but the manager is on break. He then asks us there anything I can do for you? And I respond it would be awesome if you could please bring me my food at this point my table is more than Half way done with their meals. The waiter leaves and says Let me check on ur food. By now I've been so hungry I started eating the left over food from my wife and daughters. About 8 minutes later my plate is brought out and still no appetizer!! I then see the manager and I demand a refund for the two plates that I didn't eat because he didn't  offer to remove my plate of food off the bill. I thought he would at least give me a 10% discount on the remainder of the bill or ask if I wanted a box to take the food that I didn't touch but neither one took place.",2 star rating,A D.

I find it annoying when I ask about food in other restaurants where they're not sure what's in it...anyway! The food here was amazing. I read another review that emphasized how NOT greasy the food is and I could not agree more. The food is of quality and you can definitely taste that.The environment is just lovely.

7/8/2013,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA","The star of the show! The light at the end of the tunnel! * insert more phrases that indicate how good this place was *Prior to reaching Los Agaves, the gf and I probably walked around 6ish miles all along state street. With our legs shot and bodies tired, the last mile to get to Los Agaves was utter misery. Should we turn back and simply kill this hunger elsewhere? No no no no! We must try this place! You order in the front, the hostess will seat you and then wait for deliciousness on a plate to be delivered. And boy, delicious was delivered to us. I will emphasize that one should get a plate that has their corn tortillas. These are freshly made and are a huge departure from the normal tortillas I am used to (Hello El Pollo Loco). The gf and I got two dishes that had corn tortillas and both were amazing. The Agaves enchiladas had a sour cream like sauce all over it and it was a wonderful combo. I had the chicken fajitas and while the rice, peppers and chicken were all great in their own rights, the corn tortillas wrapped it (pun intended) all together in a nice package. Additionally, the rice in both of the dishes were a step above the typical orange rice you get a mexican joints. I think the gf and I spent the next 10 minutes raving to each other about how pleased we were with this meal. This was hands down the best meal we had during our Santa Barbara trip. We contemplated coming back the next day for lunch. It is that good.",5 star rating,Jeffrey J.

The food is freshly prepared with a wonderful selection of salsas. The chicken tortilla soup is a favorite but have an appetite since the portions are large. Another favorite is the fish tacos which are the best I've had. The mango dressing on the side salad is amazing. Try any of the daily specials posted on the chalk board. The portions are large, great presentation and they use the freshest ingredients. The service is friendly and very accommodating. I've been here several times now and it has always been spot on. The restaurant is deceiving bigger than it looks but get there early.",4 star rating,Mark T.

I live here in SB and I've been dragged to Los Agaves (multiple locations but mostly Milpas)  more than enough times to say I've given a lot of different menu options a try.  The great mystery that my friends and I ponder over drinks at other restaurants is how we cannot - if our lives depended on it (that would be a weird scenario, though)  - figure out how this came to be the best rated SB restaurant on Yelp.  The food isn't really bad (some of the dishes are above average) but it's mediocre. Trust me, the food doesn't live up to the reviews. They have cool plates. And a little mold that puts the rice into a pyramid. Woo. That doesn't make the food any better, it's just different looking.  And the people who talk about this being ""authentic"" Mexican food in their reviews must have never set foot south of the border. It gets two stars because the staff (at all the locations) are quite friendly and efficient. I'll definitely give them that.

5/6/2017,"Palmdale, CA","I don't know what I expected but it wasn't fast food style of ordering. That's okay though, we saw and decided to stay. You stand in line wait to order and after you get your number you find a table to sit down. We had asked about grabbing a table while the rest of our party waited in line to order but we were told we needed a number first. We were assured that there are always tables.... there are not. After we got our number we looked for a table and waited while every employee who passed us asked how many were in our party and said they would find one. While we waited we saw some of our food (chips and guacamole) pass by, the people looked for our number, they spoke to each other and one of the gentleman let them know we were waiting for a table and they took it back with them. The moment a table came available they quickly cleared and cleaned it for us. (A+)Out came the guacamole (that we had seen earlier, but this time without the chips) followed very quickly by the steak fajita plate. We waited for awhile and then the rice and beans came out. Awhile later the steak quesadilla. Waited a bit longer and the chips and fajita tortillas came out. Still waited for the carne asada plate (my food). The veggie quesadilla appetizer came out. Still waited. Awhile later someone asked if we were waiting for something still. Reminded them of my dinner and the side of sour cream we had asked for (3 times). Awhile later still my dinner came out. Cut open my steak (I ordered well done) and saw it was med rare (more on the rare side). Ate a few bites of rice while I waited to get someone's attention. Finally the sour cream came and I mentioned my steak. They took it back to fix and it took a long while. During this time everyone else finished their meals and plates were cleared away. It finally came out and it was well done. It was a completely different steak as it hadnt been cut into, however there was NO flavor. We all tried it. It was total disappointment especially after having waited SO long (1 1/2 hours or so for fast food style of food!) I ended up leaving it on the table after a couple more bites of rice and beans. We also had a spider climb down and visit our table.We won't be back. Almost $100 (after tip) for food that took forever and was just okay to bad. (You paid and tipped BEFORE you get the food)Also the blood orange margarita was sour and was also left barely touched on the table. The people (when you could get their attention-they were busy) were nice and helpful, but couldn't make up for the time and taste. However if you do go get the steak quesadilla. It was the best thing the table had.",1 star rating,Tanya P.
5/16/2015,"Ventura, CA","Amazing service and even better food!!!!We ordered, filled up some salsas, sat down, dipped a chip in salsa and boom! Food was here! The quickest service ever! And the food wasn't even sacrificed. We had the agaves enchiladas which were amazing. Filled with fresh halibut and topped with savory chipotle cream sauce. We also had the grilled chicken enchilada and subbed the green sauce for chipotle cream sauce. We asked for extra sauce and were given a huge bowl of it for free!! Yes we love that sauce! Definitely recommending to all our friends and family.",5 star rating,Vaish P.

Both were very good. The dressing on the salad they serve with the entrees is de-li-cious! Seriously so good! The salad is mixed greens, mango, mandarin oranges and cranberries. They also served our entrees with a side of rice.They give you free chips and have a salsa bar. We tried several varieties - all were very good. A little on the expensive side but you can tell they use high quality ingredients so you get what you pay for. Overall, we were pleased and highly recommend!",4 star rating,Tori M.
6/5/2015,"Oxnard, CA","The food: I had the agaves enchiladas with shrimp and halibut, and it changed my life!  The portion of seafood was generous given the $13 price point but the sauce was really the star of this dish.  It was also served with a side salad and Spanish rice which were both fantastic.  I also ate off of a couple of others' plates and everything was as good as what I ordered, so you really can't go wrong. The setup: You order at the counter and get a number then seat yourself so it is really casual.  I didn't know this when I planned to stop here with a group of 14, but the staff there helped me get enough tables together to seat our group all together.  The service was fast and friendly so I don't have a single complaint.To go or not to go?Go: If want a casual dining experience with authentic Mexican dishes with bold flavors. If you are looking for a low-cost night out. At $11-$15 a plate and portions large enough to share, this really could be a weekly stop without breaking the bank.Don't go: If you are craving greasy paperbag/foil Mexican food.  If you require full-service dining.  Although the food is upscale and tastes like a 5-star restaurant, you do have to get your on drinks and utensils so this may not be the best option to take someone on a first-date (the right girl will love it though!)",5 star rating,Cortney T.
10/19/2018,"Los Altos, CA","Los Agaves is located  in ""little Mexico"" 2.5 miles from the Mission.  Study the paper menu well before walking up to counter to order.  The salsa bar has 5 different types of salsa.  We ordered the combo fish/shrimp taco.  Love the flavors of the creamy sauce and crispy lettuce with the shrimp. The fish was super soft but kinda blend. I like my fish deep fried and crispy. Chamorro was tender and the sauce has a kick to it. They did not skimp on the chicken or cheese for their chicken quesadilla. Taquitos were ok, more of an appetizer than a meal. Medium amount of seatings. It was a warm evening so the doors were open to let the breeze in, along with some bees and flies that were a nuisance. 4 meals and 3 sodas for $72 so definitely $$.  Overall, food was very good and fresh. Environment OK.  Service also very good, staff courteous and attentive. We recommended this place to our friends and would definitely come back.",4 star rating,Mary C.
7/27/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Meal was on point. I got the agave burrito which comes with fish and shrimp it was delicious. The side salad was interesting, good.  I usually don't like fruit on my green salad but this was good. The rice had a nice flavor and texture. My husband got the pollo asado plate. The chicken was not dry it kept its juices. It came with a cheese stuffed green pepper rice and beans. The combination of food complemented each other. Their salsas were amazing. Ranging from mild to hot. I'll make sure to come back when ever I'm here visiting from Norwalk.",5 star rating,M Teresa C.

There is also a salsa and sides bar where you can sample many different chip sides. Really tasty.The service process is surprisingly effective.

4/2/2015,"Houston, TX","Yelp, you really need half stars. This place is definitely 3.5-4 stars, not really 3. So my girlfriend and I walked here from the hotel we were staying at. It was a brisk 3 mile round trip. So if you don't like walking, you should drive there. Parking is street only (meter). As mentioned by other yelpers, the line definitely is LONG but do not fear. Their cashier and servers are super awesome and efficient. The line was out the door when we got there but we only waited about 10 minutes to order our food. We also got lucky about finding a table (so if u go with someone, have them sit and find a table before ordering)Old school restaurant decor, kinda like Olvera street of DTLA. Ordered Tacos Baja (shrimp and fish; battered) and burrito agave (seafood burrito). They were both served with rice and side salad. Their salsa bar is super legit, they constantly re-fill them and they were super fresh and delicious. Tacos baja was solid. Packed with slaws, shrimp and fish. The tortillas for the tacos were probably the most ""so-so"" thing about the meal. Shrimp tasted super crunchy and good. Fish was solid as well. Burrito agave was humongous. They had mangos on top of my burrito (which had some sauce on top), which brought some sweetness to my burrito. Everything tasted fresh. My burrito also had avocado inside so that was a huge plus for me. It's definitely on the heavy side so come hungry. Overall, a good place. I think I'll come back if I'm in SB again.",3 star rating,David P.

11/17/2013,"Venice, CA","Delicious Mexican (with sides of American) fare.  Order up front when you get in and they bring it to your table.  We rolled in around 930am on a Sunday morning and it wasn't crowded.I got the Los Agaves burrito, which was pretty good: halibut, shrimp, lettuce, avocado; drowned in a tasty creamy chipotle sauce and topped with mango. Loved the amount of shrimp and halibut, but not the biggest fan of all the iceberg lettuce in there.  The side salad, though not in keeping with the Mexican theme, was awesome! Mixed baby greens with mandarin orange & cranberry, yum.BF got the chilaquiles (verde) and liked it.  He's big on authentic Mexican food, so that is a great sign.  Chips were perfect - not too dry, not too wet.  Also good were the fried potatoes that came on the side - cooked with generous amounts of bacon (also not quite Mexican, but awesome).  A note of caution: make sure to read the salsa descriptions before diving in.  The spicy habanero is dangerous. Oops.  Pico de gallo, verde, and the creamy green one were my faves.",4 star rating,Melissa Y.

People are less likely to be out with even a sprinkle. Lol..I am going to say it... Los Agaves is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever. When you are in line to order, a staff member hands you a menu. They give you a number to display at your table. Before your meal, the waitresses bring a basket of chips. Grab the salsas of your choice. We got salsa habanero (hot) and salsa mercado (? A black one w/roasted tomato).Chicken poblano mole - my favorite dish...perfect.Piccada - Carne asada on corn meal w/soft tortillasTacos del mar (halibut) - two soft tacos w/a green salad (this is ok, i rec the others)Loved the tortillas, the mole, the chicken (portion size).

We decided to share an order of steak nachos, and boy am I glad we shared.  They were HUGE! We couldn't even finish them so I can't even imagine one person eating the whole thing and there was two of us. We each had horchata and we both thought we'd do without it next time.  It lacked flavor but the food more than made up for it. They have a small parking lot behind the building that we parked in and plenty of tables inside.  It'd be nice if they had a patio, but hey can't have your cake and eat it too as they say.

When I walked into Los Agaves, I saw that two of two mole dishes were both on the Specials menu.The guy smiled and told me the mole was homemade. I ordered the mole enchilada and tasted the sauce, which bursted with flavor from various ingredients.

The enchilada sauce was a bit bland and didn't complement the salsas well, which was unfortunate because the salsa bar is amazing. Better than Los Arroyos in fact.

8/7/2015,"West Hollywood, CA","Good spot to go for relatively quick, good, casual Mexican food. Location/Setting: I have to say that the location is kind of unfortunate because  its basically on its own in regards to other restaurants or shopping or anything, having said that, it's nice because it's not typically crowded with tourists. The setting is casual and you stand in a short line to order your food and then take a number and sit wherever you'd like. It's the type of place you could meet with friends for a quick lunch or even do a casual family gathering. Food:There menu is of a decent size and they are also very generous with their servings. It's your typical Mexican restaurant menu that doesn't stray to far from the norm. What does stand out about this place is that they have a really fun salsa bar with dozens of different salsas that you are free to help yourself to accompanied by bottomless chips. Entrees are just above average but very satisfying. If you want to avoid having anything to unhealthy they have a good selections of salads with chicken and avocado and really good dressing that always fill me up!Service: The service is pretty basic but the staff is still friendly and attentive; I've never had any issues.

The line outside and rumored 20 minutes wait seemed ridiculous  in a city where Mexican food can be found every few blocks. Well, I withstood the wait and my mind was blown. The menu selection was extensive -- halibut  and shrimp enchiladas, crazuelas, mocajetes,  chicken with mole, chile poblano, fish Veracruz. The staff is exceptionally polite and service is fast. At first glance, it appears to be a NICER kind if fast food joint. But nope, the flavors were exceptional and every single patron served with a smile.    Hands down his is the most delicious ""party on the tongue"" Mexican cuisines I have tasted,  yuuummmmm",5 star rating,Jill D.

I ordered the shrimp and halibut red pepper enchiladas with mexican rice and mango, mandarins and dried cranberries salad! Yum! Hubby ordered the tampiquiena (carne asada steak) with taquito, chicken enchilada and beans! Amazing! Salsa bar has 5-6 on point salsas! A must for any Mexican restaurant.

1/30/2015,"San Francisco, CA","Meh. Not bad. The place is clean and well maintained. The staff is polite and efficient. The food is fresh and the service is quick but the food is just really bland. It is just uninteresting to eat but if you are just hungry and not in the mood for an experience then this place will suffice. It is just a shame this place is so highly rated because there is much better Mexican food in the area and I feel like this place kind of gets in the way and almost gives it a bad name. It was too much a fast food place. On the one had, consistency is good but not when quality suffers. So not bad, but I have better things to do",3 star rating,James B.
5/16/2017,"San Francisco, CA","Service was quick. You walk in order your food, take a number, and find a table. In less than 10 minutes our food was at the table. I ordered 3 tacos 1 crispy with chicken , the other two soft one with chicken and the other one with cheese and peppers. I would definitely go with all crispy next time just because it has lettuce cheese and sauce whereas the soft tacos come just with chicken or the meat you order and nothing else. Overall, delicious. Taco Tuesdays $2.50 tacos and beer. Sweet deal!",4 star rating,Michelle A.
11/25/2017,"Temecula, CA","Looking for a quality place to eat with fair prices can be a challenge I'm SB, but if you are searching for authentic Mexican food look no further than Los Agaves. We purposely find ways to drive through Santa Barbara just to have a meal. The lines can be long (order at the counter) and if you're looking for ""romantic or intimate"" this is probably not for you, but the food far out-ways those details. I would recommend the shredded beef or seafood enchiladas, but really everything we have had so far is amazing. Ask for recommendations at the counter. Their suggestions are always good. The service is great and those individuals who serve the food are smiling as they hustle happily through their shift (don't forget to tip!). Stop by as a local or as a quick visit because your in town. Either way, you won't be disappointed.",5 star rating,NoFrills J.
12/1/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Holy cow! This is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. My wife had the Enchiladas Suizas (Suiza=Swiss cheese topping) that was the special. I had the Tacos del Mar- exsquisite, perfectly cooked fish with mango & cabbage. The ladies next to us had soups (pozole?) that looked to die for. I think they saw me envisioning eating their meal too. The owners walk around talking to everyone. Everyone is awesome and it's makes me wish I lived in Santa Barbara.The salsa bar is one of the best I've ever been too. Get these...1) light green sauce 2) chipotle3) mild house salsaI wish it would rain tacos.",5 star rating,Dave D.
1/11/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I eat at Los Agaves often. Their seafood is always fresh. Last week while I was waiting for tire repair across the street, I had the best salmon I have ever had anywhere. It was cooked perfectly, not dry and had grilled shrimp served with it.

3/21/2015,"Playa Del Rey, CA","My husband had the incredible molcajetes = seafood stew with giant prawn, salmon, halibut, clams, peppers, scallion and cheese in the most flavorful tomato broth accompanied by fresh, homemade tortillas. The fish and seafood was perfectly cooked, but the broth was magical.I had a light refreshing salad with romaine, tomato, cucumber, avocado, jicama and mango. I'm not a fan of sugary dressings and dried cranberries in salads, so I used fresh lime from the salsa bar instead of the sweet, creamy mango dressing. Extensive salsa bar: seven or so different salsas of varying heat and smokiness. A very popular place with a long line, but it didn't take so long to get a table at 5.30 on a Sat night. Many great specials that aren't on the regular menu. Highly recommended!",5 star rating,Nikki O.

12/26/2012,"Orange County, CA","We took our in-laws here on their first visit to SoCal. This was also our 2nd trip to Santa B. We wanted authentic Mexican food and came here. At first when you walk in, it's a bit overwhelming when the place is busy, which I suspect is often. There was a long line on a Friday at lunchtime. Street parking was also a block away. Mom-in-law and I both ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. Hubby ordered the fish tacos. Dad-in-law ordered the chile relleno. We all had huge portions except for dad.I can't honestly say that I know what an authentic mole sauce tastes like. But, my meal was very, very good. The sauce was complex, deep, rich, delicious, and tasted like a lot of love and care had gone into its preparation. Mom and I were both impressed. However, my beans were completely under-seasoned and akin to baby food. Rice was good and moist. Hubby's fish tacos were the best he's had in SoCal thus far. They came with a delicious light and fruity salad. Again, the portions were huge and either entree could've been split between 2 people.All of the sauces in the salsa bar were good and hotter than we are used to... Medium was very spicy. I especially loved the green avocado sauce. Tortilla chips were ho-hum.My only other complaint is that the salsa bar is located by the bathrooms, which are located to the right of the ordering station. It's a very narrow space that tends to get very, very crowded. As for the general ambiance, I don't agree with other reviewers who said it is cafeteria-like. It is a bit noisy, but it's nicely decorated inside. Overall, we enjoyed our lunch and wouldn't hesitate to come back again. Next time, I will order the fish tacos and see if hubby was right!",4 star rating,Dawn H.

4/5/2015,"Laguna Beach, CA","This spot is top notch. They do mexican food right! This is not your small hole in the wall or mom and pop shop, it is a classy establishment with great service that cranks out quality dishes. You know you found a good spot when they open at 11am and there was already a line forming by 11:15am. We ordered the agaves burrito and the tacos del mar. I can highly recommend both...if you order the tacos del mar, make sure to get both tacos with shrimp as they were much more flavorful than the blackened halibut. The agaves burrito was covered in a chipotle cream sauce which is always a winner. Both meals came with a side of rice and a salad. Usually not a fan of side salads but their dressing was rather sweet, almost like a desert, which made it delicious.One of my favorite things about Los Agaves was the salsa bar. They had over 7 different salsas to try ranging from mild to hot. My favorite was the roasted chipotle salsa!If you're looking for a classy, yet casual mexican restaurant to grab lunch while you are in Santa Barbara look no further than Los Agaves!",5 star rating,Steven A.

We ordered an appetizer (chicken nachos) which would have served as a meal unto itself and two entrees (steak burrito and pescado veracruz). The guacamole is beyond amazing, the best I've ever had from a restaurant. Service:We ordered takeaway, so this relates only to pick up. The food was ready by the time they said it would be. The nachos had started to get slightly soggy but the burrito and fish were fine. We also were able to pick our own sauces to try out at their sauce and toppings (onion, pico, jalapeños, etc) bar.

7/26/2016,"Hawthorne, CA","This place was recommended by a couple of family members who visit Santa Barbara often. I decided to give it a shot and wasn't disappointed. The food was very good. My family members exaggerated the ""Enchiladas Suizas"" which were very good but not great. I can honestly say that the visit was pleasant and is a place that I will visit again in the future.Only 1 thing I didnt like though.... I am a picky eater so I ask what comes in the food. On the menu itself, it indicates what ingredients come with each plate. I ordered the ""Queso Fundido"" which said it came with cheese and chorizo. When I got the plate, it came with onion, bell pepper, chile slices, cheese and chorizo. Like I said, I'm a picky eater and that's why I ask what comes with the plate. Im not the type of person to complain to the waiter or return my food, so I just ate around the stuff I dont like.

And honestly, when my friend and I saw the line out the door for Los Agaves, we almost turned around and left. But I'm really glad we didn't.It was a hot day and it was even hotter inside the restaurant. I kept going back and forth about ordering the molcajete (I'd never had one before and it looked huge!) but my friend convinced me that I would regret it if I didn't, so I went all out and got the earth and sea version.Although seating seemed impossible, the hostess managed to find us a table, and I enthusiastically brought one of each salsa from the salsa bar to accompany our chips (both of which were DELICIOUS). My molcajete was huge as I predicted, but I was extra-surprised as to how generous they were the meats and seafood. I had plenty left to take home with me. The dish itself was delicious and flavorful - spiced but not spicy, served with a side of amazing corn tortillas (I usually don't like corn tortillas, but these were heavenly!)I would 100% without a doubt come back here (and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone) and face all the waiting and heat that comes with it.

12/28/2014,"Rosemead, CA","This place is fantastic and it lived up to it's billing as one of the yelp top 100 restaurants in the US.  Although there are 3 Los Agaves restaurants in Santa Barbara, we decided to come here with the most positive reviews on Yelp.  Here is my breakdown of the place:Concept:This place kinda reminds me of a high end Rubios because you line up to order/pay and then you have to find your own seating.  They will give you a number at the cash register and they'll bring out the food to your table.  Food:We had 4 people on our party and we ordered the following items:**Nachos - This is so good as they mix beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese, and chips altogether.  The chips are crispy.  As a side note, they have their own salsa bar near the fountain drink where you can use as well.**Chicken Enchiladas - this is super good.  They give you rice and beans on the side but I thought this was just fabulous.  A must try for sure.  **Ensalada Vallarta (Salad) - I love the mango dressing.  The lettuce is super fresh and it tastes even better when you add chicken.  **Molcajetes (Sea and Earth) - Although the items mentioned above were all fantastic, what I loved the most is the Molcajetes.  We went with ""sea and earth"" which included shrimp, beef, chicken, and fish.  OMG, this is a MUST TRY. Parking:I did not see any parking spaces nearby so I ended up parking on the street.  Service:It's like Rubios where you find your own seating.  If its gets too busy, you may ask the servers to help find a table for you.  Also, the servers are very nice if you need to get additional utensils and plates.     Additional Tips/Suggestions:Come here early!!!  We got here at 6pm and there was already a line.  I would come again to try the burritos and tacos.",5 star rating,Michael H.
9/12/2014,"Pasadena, CA","Got the taquitos and tampiquenaTaquitos were honestly the best I've ever had. I would guess most places just throw in the shredded chicken and roll it up. Los Agaves however puts seasoned chicken into the taquitos and they just shine (really because of the grease they were fried up in. jk :P)The Tampiquena was a generous portion of carne asada with a red enchilada, another taquito but with a red sauce on top and pinto beans like I'd never seen before. Everything was packed with flavor and delicious. The homemade tortilla was great, but it wasn't the highlight of the entree whatsoever.

9/5/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","The husband and I found Los Agaves on yelp when we were heading to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  We were so happy we stopped here and ate until we were ready to burst!  The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly.  You order at the counter and sit anywhere you want while eating free chips and salsa.  The husband had the fish and shrimp fajitas and was super happy with his choice.  I had two chicken tacos, one soft and one crispy.  I was surprised to say that the crispy one was my favorite due to the fact the shredded chicken was amazing!You won't be dissapointed when you come here!",4 star rating,Kylie L.
6/29/2015,"Cleveland, OH","Solid food but love the atmosphere most of all. This spot's a hybrid between a take out Mexican place and a sit down restaurant in the best way. Order at the counter, get a number, grab your salsas and silverware, seat yourself and the service staff will take it from there. Great inside decor as well.I had the mole enchiladas and a Negro Modelo on tap and found myself a happy camper. The only (and mostly negligible) downside was that they didn't have a standout salsa, but hey, that just means more room for enchiladas right?",4 star rating,Scarlett C.

The dressing was way too sweet, not my liking. My boyfriend ordered the molcajete (most popular dish), wow! No wonder everyone in the restaurant was ordering this. Variety of cuts of meats/cheese/nopales. Came with tortillas, fresh and definitely homemade. Looking forward to our next visit here.

I had the Agaves Enchiladas (two halibut and prawn enchiladas covered in a creamy chipotle sauce) aaaaaand a side of chile relleno. Turned out the chile relleno was about as big as the enchilada plate! Both were delicious - but the star was def the enchiladas. The free chips were light and crispy and still warm. Plenty of salsas to choose from at the salad bar. None too spicy (I like a lot of heat). Will definitely stop by next time I pass through SB!!,5 star rating,Zolene Q.

There is a salsa bar but we didn't know that when our tacos arrived to the table and looked so bare. The place was so crowded that we didn't have much time to look at menu let alone see the salsa bar. Service was good and they give to endless refills on chips and salsa. Their chips are thin and crispy just like I like em. We went on a Tuesday and overall great price for our tacos and beers. My favorite taco was the Al Pastor. If I came back, I'd get a plate or meal instead of single tacos.",4 star rating,Rachel V.

2/20/2017,"West Lebanon, NH","Was attracted to going here due to the Yelp reviews and locals' recommendations.  It was....just okay.  I'm still not 100% alright with the idea of ""counter service,"" i.e., ordering at counter then navigating your way into finding a table.  Especially when you're paying full sit-down restaurant prices like you are at Los Agaves.  There can be a lot of ""up & down,"" with needing to find a table, get your own silverware/napkins then going through the salsa buffet station, etc.  Our dinners were perfectly fine (chicken mole enchiladas and halibut/shrimp fajitas), but the agave margaritas were definitely not first-rate, as they had almost none of the punch you'd expect from lime and other fresh ingredients.  And, I just can't get excited about a Mexican restaurant that has lackluster margaritas like these.  Los Agaves is worth a try, however, temper your expectations.",3 star rating,Monty H.

Looked on Yelp and saw this place was rated #1, and couldn't have been happier!  I was taken back that I had to order from the counter, and have the food delivered but it did not effect the presentation, or quality of the food.  I got the Mojoado, I think that is how you spell it. It was a wet burrito with steak.  AMAZING!  Im not a big Spanish rice fan, it's usually something I use to compliment my beans, but their Spanish Rice at one point was being shoveled into my mouth by it's self, that is how flavorful it is. I LOVED IT.  The entire experience, with wait staff, salsa bar, and food could not have started by birthday off better!",5 star rating,Ambar B.
10/20/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Its good, but not great. It is a sit down date place but you pay at the counter cafe style. This place has an identity crisis. You can do better, and worse.

9/17/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","100% addicted to Los Agaves. The most consistent and delicious mexican food in Santa Barbara. Love that they give you chips and salsa while you wait, unlike other places in town that charge you for it. Carlos the owner could not be a nicer guy, and neither could the entire staff. Always remembers us and have actual conversations rather than just take our order and our money and move on. I only live a block from here, and its a miracle i don't eat here everyday.

Santa Barbara is inundated with Mexican restaurants so it was hard to choose, but then this one came up and it's off State street so we decided to try it. Good thing we did! Wow! Good selection, good quality food and the flavors are superb. The only bad thing about this place is that you have to look for a place to sit. I'd prefer a hostess seating you than having to kind of Social Darwin someone for a table. Thank God their food is so good we couldn't really complain.",5 star rating,Stephanie M.

8/14/2012,"New York, NY","Santa Barbara is known for its Mexican food, and it does not disappoint.  When I got into town this past summer, this was the first place I ate.  I was initially put off as it looks a little polished for a casual Mexican place.  I was thinking some a little more stereotypical I guess--smaller, less options, dirtier--but whatever!  They have a good 8 different salsas to choose from, of which the salsa verde, pico de gallo, and one other spicy one I liked; the others weren't really my cup of tea, but I'm sure others appreciate them.  There was a decent amount of dining space, but we just got our stuff to go.  Although they have a large menu that looks great, I kept things basic.  I got a pretty damn great chicken burrito here (burrito majado).  Not perfect, but up there.  The biggest fault was that there wasn't quite enough chicken, but what was there was tender and delclious.  They also went a little overboard with the emlted cheese, but all of the ingredients were all of high quality and fresh--especially the guacamole.  We also got some chips, which were freshly made and helped us try all of the different salsas.  This is the kind of great Mexican food I wish we had more of in NY: great tasting, reasonably priced (especially for the portion), and with fresh ingredients.  It's not that hard people!  And yet it is.  I'll be back next time I'm in Santa Barbara!",4 star rating,Justin L.
9/24/2017,"Lancaster, CA","The system of order then they will find you a seat scared me, but we were seated right away, after we ordered. The system works.  Our food came out really fast and tasted pretty good. The place was packed, so the speed and quality of the food was a welcome surprise. They are very efficient at clearing tables. Prices were reasonable, and proportions were comparable to most other restaurants.  The only issue is parking, but that is the fault of the popularity and population of the area.",5 star rating,Elvisby J.
8/16/2016,"Pasadena, CA","I didn't know Mexican heaven could exist in your mouth and belly. The Los agaves burrito opened up a portal in my mouth, took me on a journey where I swam in a haze of sea food that I never thought could taste good in a burrito. Usually a beef burrito kinda guy but this concerted me to the church of seafood burritos. I was speaking in tongues, my eyes rolling up in a utter delicious food coma spell. The things I would do for this burrito... I'd fly it first class on private jets, kept warm in a heat oven until it landed safely in my mouth in LA. I would solve world hunger by raining down these burritos across the planet. This burrito might even solve our world peace problem. It needs to be on the cover of Time magazine. I will perform a yearly pilgrimage to this burrito, and absolutely wreck havoc on my intestines. Los agaves, thank you for showing me the pinnacle of taste.

Today they served an ancient, hard sope and screwed up a guacamole taco--sending chicken instead. Service is hot or miss. It's sad, because I love their mole.

That or they have stuffs on the board as well. It was a tad crowded around 1 but there are tables here and there.We ordered: ENCHILADAS w/1 beef taco. It comes with beans and rice but you can replace either one with SALADS if you want to. We chose chicken with green sauce and it was delicious! The flavor of the chicken was really tasty, not dry at all! The portion is big and even after sharing 1 dish, we were super full off of it!!! After you order, they give you a number and you can go claim a table. They'll bring out the food afterward. They start you off with some warm tortillas chips! The salsa is near the cashier and drink fountain. They have some really good salsa as well! Love the mild and medium one along with tomatoes.

My boyfriend loved his food and the prices were fairly reasonable.  I had a vegetarian quesadilla and I am convinced that they re-plated my food on either a dirty dish or someone else's before moving it on to my plate.  I kept finding flakes of Salmon on my food. Yucky! I'm a vegetarian. I had my boyfriend try the flakes (which of course being the eat anything type of person he is, he thought they were delicious) and confirmed that yes, they were salmon.

6/23/2012,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA","Second time not as great as the first time.About a year ago we stopped here for lunch on the way back to L.A. after reading the great Yelp reviews.  My family and I enjoyed our lunch a year ago, but yesterday it was a different story. My husband ordered the Burrito Majado for $8.00 which he enjoyed.  It's the wet burrito with grilled steak (or chicken), pinto beans, topped with melted cheese and salsa rosa and served with rice, guacamole and shredded lettuce and sour cream.  I'd rate this as a 5/5 stars.My son ordered the shrimp torta for $9.50 which was a big mistake.  It was basically a huge roll slathered with chipotle sauce.  He took two bites and that was it.   It didn't look like there was any shrimp on it.  I'll give that the minimum of 1/5 stars.  He then ordered the shrimp taco.  It was covered with way too many shredded vegetables which wasn't too great either.   I'll give that a 2/5 stars.   He did like their rice, so that's a 5/5 stars.I was dying for a basic carnita street taco ala carte, because I didn't want rice and beans.  They don't have the thinner corn tortillas, so it was served on these really thick  tortillas which were o.k.  The pork was way too salty, chunky and had an excessive amount of fat all over it.  That was it.  No onions or cilantro, so I raided my husbands plate for some additional items.  I'd give those a 2/5 stars just because it was just meat and tortillas and nothing else.The service is great.  All the employees are friendly.  You order at the counter, they give you a number and deliver your food when it is ready.   They also bring chips to the table.    The manager came by to see if everything was o.k. after we received our food which was nice.  It's hard to complain when it is just how they prepare dishes and kids can be a little picky sometimes.   They have many different types of pico di gallo and salsa at the salsa bar.  I'll give them a 5/5 for service.In conclusion, I think my son and I just ordered the wrong things.  If my memory serves me correctly the enchiladas were good last year.",3 star rating,Cydney M.

6/25/2014,"Seattle, WA","I love the food here! Ordered a two entrees with the house salad.I had the crispy taco with chicken and the chile relleno. The chile relleno is very rich with cheese so if you don't like cheese this isn't the plate for you.The crispy taco is eh. I had higher expectations for that one. The rice is very good and same with the house salad. Although I didn't like the mangoes in the salad, as it was a more like a raw mango, yet a bit sweet. The tangerine in the salad was definitely canned, and I'm sure the cranberries were store bought too. But the sauce made is delish!I heard the Baka tacos (fish tacos) were good but I didn't try it. Maybe next time.",5 star rating,Cathy P.

7/9/2017,"Costa Mesa, CA","Best ceviche in Santa Barbara, as well as a broad offering of Mexican menu items, and a benchmark family-run restaurant in Santa Barbara.  Nothing pretentious, it's order-at-the-counter and deliver-to-table, which gives you time to look over the extensive menu and the daily specials.  All good, been there many times and never disappointed.  TIP: come early or late, as the most popular times are fairly long waits.",4 star rating,Michael H.

6/21/2014,"Grover Beach, CA","This place is the real deal! Was recommended by a docent at Lotus Land, and after double checking on Yelp, we were sold.We didn't expect it to be an order at the counter eatery, but we looked at the menu and decided on our meals. I went with the Agaves Enchiladas (Fresh halibut & shrimp, red pepper & onions, topped with chipotle sauce, rice & salad with a mango dressing) as this was recommended by the clerk. After ordering, we looked for a table. It was quite busy and there weren't many tables available, so we sat at a table in the hall. Not ideal, but after a few minutes another couple got up from their table and we slipped in.Our food came out within 10 minutes or so, and the presentation was great. I'm not an expert on Mexican cuisine-I usually order a chicken burrito or fish tacos-but these enchiladas were fricken amazing! Each bite was jam packed with flavor and contained a huge chunk of fish. The sauce was so good, I came close to licking the plate. Fortunately my date had extra tortilla, so I moped it up with that. The salad was also tasty-I wasn't sure how the mango dressing would jive with the enchiladas, but it worked seamlessly; a wonderful balance of flavors. They were so good, I went up to order two more. Sadly, the line was too long and I don't have patience, so I bowed out. I recommend you ask for more sauce on the enchiladas, there's a huge heap of rice that goes perfectly with it!It's definitely in the top 3 best meals I've had all year-WELL DONE, a great business. I hope these guys don't change a thing!",5 star rating,Louis C.
5/17/2014,"Sugar Land, TX","In another life, this place could have been a Hollywood club.Food: Came here during a retreat with a group looking for delicious and fresh Mexican food. Was our hunt a success? I'd answer that with a yes, with caveats. We collectively pigged out on nachos (yelp.com/biz_photos/los-…) and numerous mimosas (yelp.com/biz_photos/los-…). I got the chicken mole tacos (yelp.com/biz_photos/los-…). While I found the chicken to be a little dry, the mole tasted great. The fact that they don't use a wide variety of ingredients was also a bit disappointing. However, the fried dough dessert we shared redeemed the experience (yelp.com/biz_photos/los-…). All in all, the food isn't mindblowing. You can find a much tastier meal from a random taco truck. Atmosphere: Loud, bustling, and bursting with people sums this place up in a nutshell. The restaurant is gorgeously decorated to the nines with Spanish-style lighting and hand painted tiles. You almost feel as if you're in some rich dude's house. Anyway, the noise level and dress of the people here reminded me of a nightclub. You'll even have to snake through a lengthy line to order. Service: I wouldn't come super hungry since you have to first get through the ordering line and then find an open table. Synopsis: It's a fun place to come with friends if you need a party-like atmosphere, but I'm not that impressed by the food.",3 star rating,Toni L.

They have like 8 different salsas to go with their fresh chips and their menu has something for everyone. We had two fish tacos (super yum - really great crispy fish) and one of the best chile rellenoes I've ever had. It was massive and loaded with cheese. The sauce was tasty and the battered outside held up to the sauce and cheese. Warning: This place, along with Super Ricas, gets packed. Expect a wait, but the line moves fast and the food comes out quick. Fortunately, it's a quick wait unlike Super Rica which can be an hour.",5 star rating,Amanda D.

People were very nice and friendly too.This was definitely a 'must return to' for our family road trips when passing US101. After coming back from Cabo for summer vacay, we were craving for authentic Mexican fare and this place really delivered. We ordered the fajita burrito, chicken/steak echiladas with mole sauce (this was my guilty pleasure) plus the 3 item plates which was a mix of chicken tacos, steak tacos and chicken enchiladas. The salsa bar had a variety of salsas that tasted fresh and yummy. As added bonus, they have huge portions for what you pay for. Where can you find soft tacos loaded with so much meat you can't even see the soft tortilla underneath? Sweeeet! But don't under estimate that hidden gem. The soft tortilla on those tacos were so good and flavourful. You can really taste the ground corn and not the blank cardboard taste that most places have. Give this place a try you won't regret it. Safe travels everyone!",5 star rating,Mami Y.

1/6/2018,"Sunland, CA","Blew in to town and needed lunch asap. Had scouted Los Agaves on Yelp prior to arrival and man did we make the right choice. Al Pastor was excellent as was the Alambres... really really good. Crowd was locals, tourists, working class joes, a great mix. Staff was friendly and efficient and the joint was spotless. We had to go back the next day to be sure it wasn't a fluke. Wise choice because this time we went straight to the ceviche which was fresh and incredible but the piece de resistance, the reason why I will return time and again was the Land And Sea Molcajete. Oh. My. God. Incredible. People: run don't walk. You can get tacos anywhere but Molcajete you can't. The sauce/broth was alone worth the money: thick, rich, flavorful. Three giant butterflied shrimp with a healthy chunk of fresh halibut mixed with chicken and beef and a couple of slices of killer chorizo sausage. Add a little cheese and some clever cactus on top.... sigh. I Can't stop thinking about it. Do you deliver to LA?",5 star rating,John E.

9/4/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm not going to pretend to tell you that I know what authentic Mexican is but I can tell you what fresh, original, flavor-packed food is, and Los Agaves was that, unequivocally. We started with the quesadilla de flor de calabaza and it was by far, one of the beat things I've had the pleasure to eat in my life. I don't eat meat too often, and there were plenty of veggie and fish options to choose from!! But I was stoked to see the meat was organic and felt it was a great opportunity to indulge. So we ordered the chicken mole enchiladas - they were divine. So oaky and smoky! Not a single salsa we tried wasn't fabulous. Cannot WAIT to get back here and try more items!!",5 star rating,Kimmy R.
3/11/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Sea & Land Mocajetes were AMAZING! Full of amazing chicken, beef, large broiled shrimp, a plank of fish, scallion, a roasted pepper, and half of a sliced avocado in a wonderful red sauce. They serve it in a large stone THING that sits on its own feet and elevates it above the platter and makes itself obvious to all. Be prepared to answer other people's questions when you order it. I actually felt bad for the other people after this monster arrived, imaging how they felt as they looked down on their burritos and rice. I'm sure they were good, but this was just so different! Their fresh salsa bar was full of wonderful selections. The thick green salsa was my favorite, but the rest were really good too. I almost didn't finish my guacamole because of them, and their fresh home-made chips! The lady that took my order was very friendly and made me feel welcome. I'd never been there before, and she suggested the Mocajetes. She also told me they could do a half order of guacamole, which is more than enough for one person. She was right about everything, and even though she wasn't the server, came to check on me and see how I liked it. Some people might think $20 plus drinks for lunch is a lot for a place where you have to stand in line to order, but the food and the friendliness of the staff make it one of the best deals in Santa Barbara IMO. Go ahead and treat yourself. You will not be sorry you did. MOCAJETES!",5 star rating,TJ S.

I order this at every place I can and I am consistently disappointed, I honestly don't know why I keep ordering it, but boy am I glad I decided to get one here. Best one I've ever had, perfect amount of breading, sauce and cheese and completely delicious.Their dining room is deceptively large, given the size of the storefront.

I swear I've been having cravings for this place like a pregnant lady.Man.. I don't even know how to describe it because its something kind of like an Ah-ha moment that clicks in your mouth. Because when you take your first bite, it's like you thought you knew Mexican food from all those taquerias you been to but then you REALIZE that this how Mexican food is suppose to be. Like the usual regular burrito, enchilada, quesadilla tastes spectacular because of the way they make their tortillas or flavor their rice or toast their quesadilla to the perfect crunch :*)** wow..The bf and I wanted to do some fine dining during our stay in Santa Barbara but none of the higher end restaurants' menus appealed to us.

We walked in and there was no wait to order and a really nice guy gave us instructions and told us he'd help us find a table if we couldn't find one. We sat at a nice window seat pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. There was no background music making the place loud and everyone in there was enjoying themselves. The food  came quick and served on real dishes. It was hot and fresh and tasted great. Very impressed with this place, it's worth checking out.",5 star rating,Jonathan M.

Chips and guacamole was good, but I ordered the ceviche wasn't great, I have had better. But my friend's burrito was pretty good. And I enjoyed the rice.They have a very small parking lot and we got lucky.",4 star rating,Justine S.

4/2/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","We went back to this place to have some lunch with friends the other day and it was PACKED on a Sunday at almost 3pm!      A well dressed man greets us with a smile and menus as we got in line (manager?  owner?) and the same guy was bussing tables, behind the counter, bringing out food - all of which says a lot.      As usual the food was awesome and everyone loved it.  Everyone working was hustling, nice AND polite - which I can say is REALLY tough when you are working in a restaurant and its slammed.  We found a table and a guy came running to make sure it was clean and ready to go.    I now can confidently say that this place (while much different) is in direct competition with Supra Rica!",5 star rating,AJ R.

7/5/2016,"Martinez, CA","Good quality food and service. I got a chile verde burrito and loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The salsa bar had quite a few unique and delicious options. Overall, Los Agaves definitely deserved its high rating, but I thought the chile verde could have been a little more flavorful. There was very little tomatillo taste, which I usually expect in a rich chile verde sauce. I enjoyed my burrito, the rice was well flavored, and the service was quick.",4 star rating,Rebecca C.

The salsa bar has something for everyone, from mild to spicy, and the restaurant itself looks great. However, if you don't like a lot of hustle and bustle, might not be for you. This place is always busy busy. I also wish they had a bigger parking lot, but I usually place my order over the phone and run in to grab my order and leave anyways.",5 star rating,Kimberly D.
7/10/2017,"Castro Valley, CA","In a word, dreadful.The only reason I give two stars is staff. Despite crowds, they remained polite. There was a large family at a table near me; a child overturned a pitcher of drink, spilling everywhere, including into food. Staff came and cleaned up and brought new food. So credit for that.The food was dreadful.I had planned to go to Palace Grill for lunch. It was Solstice Day and I hid out by the ocean to avoid crowds. But Palace Grill was closed and my two back up places were in the midst of the mad scene. As Los Agaves was off the beaten path, I figured I'd try them.Note that from where I was staying to ocean is a 4-mile round trip walk and this added around 3 more miles. On a warm day.I ordered the chicken burrito and fruit drink. The drink was very sugary and reminded me of the so-called ""Hawaiian punch"" from my childhood. The burrito was so bad. They may use Mary's chicken (I buy it for my own cooking); if so, waste of a good chicken's life. The ""rojo"" sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. If there was any seasoning it was not discernible. No chili, cumin, nothing. Rice OK. Beans bland. Burrito wrapped in layer upon layer upon layer of doughy flour tortilla. About 1/3 of the way through I could not handle more and unwrapped, just ate the chicken. Remember, I'd walked miles and was hungry.Walking back that burrito sat like a stone in my stomach. I felt lousy all day. Not just bloated or over full, really sick. By evening things seemed calmer and I went to dinner where I had a reservation - but as soon as they brought me my food realized I could not eat. The nausea was so bad I was afraid I'd upchuck or pass out so I paid and left, fast. A place I had really looked forward to trying. I can only conclude some people give good yelp reviews to any place that has cheap prices and large portions.Los Agaves has both, but being sick all day from lousy food is a very steep price in the long run.",2 star rating,Carol S.

11/26/2014,"Manhattan, NY","We stopped by this cute little place for lunch on a road trip to Santa Barbara for wine tasting. Beat the rush and come here a little before noon if you don't want to wait in line. I had the Gringo El Pastor, which is basically a quesadilla roll. The distribution of meat and cheese were so even and every bite was very tasty! Husband had the Mahi Mahi with Cilantro Pesto and the fish was cooked very well. The Molcajete was also good. Sizzling hot and tomatoey but not too spicy. I wasn't sure what to expect but it's like a warm cooked salsa with meats/seafood inside. Definitely a first for me. Salsa Bar was probably my favorite part. Over 6 different salsas including a spicy habanero :D I was super stoked but a friend couldn't stop sweating after tasting a small amount, so be careful if you don't have a strong stomach /tastebud!",4 star rating,Angelina L.

3/23/2014,"Carpinteria, CA",Santa Barbara is known for its great Mexican food but somehow I never heard of this place until I read a small article about it. After reading the article I was on my way to give it a try and see what the fuss was about. Wow! How the hell have I not heard of this place before? The many great Mexican restaurants in the area and this one jumps to the top of my list. In one word to describe this place-Authentic. For breakfast I ordered the chilaquiles and the wife ordered the molcajetes. We also ordered some corn cake dish to give it a try. These are by far the best chiliquiles I ever ate. Everything tasted fresh and home made. The portion was large and I was completely satisfied with this dish. My wife's dish came in a steaming stone pot(molcajetes) and was bubbling with an amazing aroma waiting to be tried once it cooled down. As far as quality this place is one of my favorite restaurants after just one visit. The food is authentic as a fine restaurant in Mexico. The portions and the price were very reasonable with the service and the quality of the food. This is a must try for any local or Mexican food lover! I will be back!,5 star rating,Richard H.

11/22/2016,"Westchester, Los Angeles, CA","Food was AMAZING. Spot has a really laid back vibe but a large dining area to accommodate all the fans, it seems. We got there right before the lunch rush and it was pretty quiet, but filled up quickly right at noon. You order and pay at the counter and they bring food to you, giving it a kind of casual vibe. The food was incredible. Fresh and fast, things were steaming and sizzling for some time after it came out. We ordered the fajitas and the burrito and both were some of the best we'd had. Portions are quite large as well, but totally worth it. Definitely coming to this spot again when we're in town.",5 star rating,Christina N.

10/29/2014,"Miami, FL","I recently visited Santa Barbara for a long weekend. Was looking to eat at another Mexican restaurant that night but it was closed for a private event. I took to Yelp to find another Mexican place nearby to satisfy my craving as there is sadly not a lot of great Mexican in Miami where I live. This is what makes Yelp so amazing- Los Agaves was a better experience than I could have imagined. The ambiance isn't exactly what I had pictured. You wait in line to order at the counter service and then the food gets delivered to your table. No frills, cafeteria style. But the quality of the food makes up for the lack of decor and ambiance. To start my boyfriend and I began with the guacamole and hit the salsa bar. The reason this review isn't five stars is because of the salsa bar. It was practically empty and had not been refilled and the whole thing was dirty from everyone else who had used it and spilled. Plus it is near the bathrooms so the lines for the bar jam up access to the bathrooms and the door is right near there. We alerted the staff and they came and cleaned up the bar but by the time they refilled it we already had our entrees. I ordered cochinita pibil which is a slow roasted pork in red sauce. The only more authentic pibil I have had was in rural mexico when some ladies literally took it out of the ground and served it to me right there. The spice on the plate was correct and the dish was large and filling. My boyfriend ordered the tampiquena- a grilled steak accompanied with a red enchilada. He also said it was authentic and some of the best he ever had. Thinking about it makes me hungry and I wish it was around the corner so I could go back more often.",4 star rating,Jennifer L.

2/24/2014,"San Jose, CA","I wanted a restaurant where you order at the counter and my husband wanted one where a waiter came to the table.  We got the best of both worlds, and incredible Mexican food, at Los Agaves.  The line was out the door, which is always a good sign.  You grab a menu while you wait to pick out what you want, then you order at the register.  They give you chips to snack on while you wait, and there's a salsa bar with a variety of options to choose from.  They bring the food to your table (based on the number they gave you when you ordered).  It's easy, and when we wanted re-fills on our beers the waitress came over and filled them for us, instead of us having to wait in line again. That's good service.The food was incredible.  I had the sea and earth Molcajetes, a dish that came in a sizzling stone pot and included every kind of meat under the sun (steak, grilled to perfection, chicken, prawns and halibut). It was one of those meals where you say ""I need to stop eating, I'm too full"", but you just keep going because it's so delicious.  My husband ordered the pork shank special, which was huge and looked like a Fred Flintstone drumstick hunk of meat. It was in a rich red sauce and cooked to tender perfection.  It's an excellent restaurant that I would recommend to anyone in SB.",5 star rating,Brooke R.

4/20/2012,"Oxnard, CA","My first visit to Los Agaves was on my birthday and I thank my co-workers for this wonderful gift!! Without a doubt the best Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbra. There are so many great things about this place I do not know where to begin...I guess I can begin by saying that the first thing I saw was a handsome man behind the counter (con todo respeto). Ok go that off my chest!!!When it comes to eating out I do not normally go to Mexican restaurants because I do not think anything compares to my mom's or grandma's cooking and I rather consume my Mexican food calories at home. Los Agaves offers dishes that my mom will never cook, they are a bit more gourmet. On my first visit, I had the salmon tacos. Simply delicious and flavorful, it had a special sauce that complimented them well and homemade tortillas. It came with a side of rice and salad, both were delicious as well. I have also tried their chicken mole tacos and cannot say enough about how good they are. They also have great salsas. My personal favorite is the guacamole salsa.  Overall its' a great restaurant.

9/25/2016,"Baton Rouge, LA","The food is the star here, as it should be. Fresh, delicious, flavorful. My chile relleno burrito was fantastic. The service and restaurant concept leaves a bit to be desired. We got there early enough to order without too much of a wait, but the counter-ordering system creates a huge line that takes up much of the front of the restaurant. It was quite hot outside and the restaurant isn't very cool - it was hard to get cups of water refilled while eating. It's very loud and rushed inside, so that was a bit disappointing. The food is good, but the experience is tarnished slightly by the chaotic atmosphere.",3 star rating,Heidi S.

2/7/2012,"Santa Clarita, CA","Los Agaves is not your typical Mexican restaurant. It offers a large specials menu of many regional favorites as well as and extensive menu of fresh & homemade Mexican classics. Nothing here is mediocre. Even the the complimentary Tortilla chips are awesome. If Los Agaves suffers from anything it's the close proximity to La Super-Rica Taqueria. This alone though shouldn't be a deterrent as the menu here is vast and warrants repeat visits and grateful loyalty. If I sound like a huge fan, I am. It's a do not miss stop for us from now on every time we're in Santa Barbara.Our lunch order:Guacamole - A generous serving of smooth guacamole w/ just a slight chili kick mixed w/ cilantro and a tangy lime flavor.Tortilla Chips w/ Fresh Salsa Bar - Every table gets freshly made warm, corn tortilla chips that we paired w/ various spice level salsas from the salsa bar. I love the Habanero salsa the best and it made the perfect pairing w/ our guacamole for alternating back and forth with.Combination 2 crispy tacos (Chicken & Beef) w/ Beans & Rice - This was my wifes choice and even though I thought it was a fairly boring choice given the wide menu the tacos were expertly crafted and the flavors were amazing. Sometimes just plain simple is perfect as this dish proved. Chile En Nogada w/ Beans & Rice - I love this regional dish and it's probably my absolute favorite, favorite Mexican meal as it highlights all of the subtle and varied nuances that are real and authentic Mexican cuisine w/ a sweet walnut sauce, a spicy Poblano chili shell, filled w/mixed ground meat & fruit & covered w/ slightly sour pomegrante seeds. It's Mexican Soul food that transports you immediately to Puebla, Mexico.  Los Agaves' version was great. The only slightly better version I've had is at La Casita Mexicana in Bell, CA. Otherwide this version was heaven. As you might have guessed we had the perfect dining experience here. Kind and efficent service, relaxed atmosphere, wonerful food at very afforadable prices and really Los Agaves is as good as it gets in Santa Barbara. Don't miss it.",5 star rating,Scott B.

Rice is perfection, guacamole clearly uses top notch avocados, so flavorful.  A minor complaint would be that the pork chunks in the burrito are too big to really eat, I had to nibble on them.

You go up to order your food and it is brought to your table. The waiters were all very friendly. The meal was authentic Mexican, and it was presented very nicely.

Enchilada with chicken (and I never eat chicken in a restaurant) was very good, like my own. (which are ""the bomb.com"") Chile relleno was flowing smooth and creamy white queso after each bite. The Sope was fantastic, make sure you pick it up to eat it! :-) Rice was better than mine, but the frijoles were why I had to drop a star.

For the prices, I'd expect a real sit down style restaurant. Saw some people who hadn't ordered food sneak in to seating area to get ahead of people who just ordered. Like really? Smart or rude not sure.  Parking was difficult.Maybe me being from Los Angeles where there is so much real Authentic Mexican food, I didn't see what all the hype was about.",2 star rating,Wendy V.
8/6/2017,"Santa Barbara Downtown, Santa Barbara, CA",Sorry mom but Los Agaves is my favorite place to eat Mexican food in town. I usually get the nachos cause a man of advance size like myself needs the hefty portion. Definitely get with carne asada and a Modelo cause its always Modelo time at Los Agaves.

11/3/2013,"Nipomo, CA","BEST Mexican restaurant I have been to so far! (And I've been to a lot, I'm Mexican!). Everything from the food to the customer service of this restaurant is just outstanding. When I went with my family me and my sister ordered agua de horchata to drink, but there was only enough for one glass left, and the cashier gave it to us for free. After we placed our order, a minute later I went back to ask if I could change something on one of the orders (my sister wanted to add chicken to her salad), the cashier was very nice about it and did it with no problems. Everyone loved what they ordered, it really is authentic Mexican food, has good presentation, and a lot of flavor. I got the cheese enchiladas with green sauce, I really recommend those over the red sauce ones!!! Not that the red sauce ones are bad, but the green sauce is so much tastier.  I will definitely be back.",5 star rating,Nora R.

Be sure to double check the specials board above the cashiers! The girl who rang us up was also super friendly and helpful.

10/28/2015,"Tustin, CA",Ok los agaves is pretty damn good for an attempt at mexican food. Ive never had anything really bad to say about the food here and i love the unlimited chips and variety of SALSAAAAA. But do not eat too many chips or else youre gonna be too full for the actual meal. The enchiladas are good and so are the tacos. I dont know why but their rice is bombskies~~~ i love spanish rice like ugh yes and the beans with it yummmmm. Get the horchata too if u like cause its good~~ Price is definitely doable and if youve lived in sb for a while youll know it aint cheap for food.,4 star rating,Jane K.
11/19/2014,"Stockton, CA","The way I figure it there are three main food groups to hit while in Santa Barbara: beef, seafood and Mexican. We had just arrived in town on a Thursday evening and needed someplace for dinner that was close to the hotel, casual, not too expensive and something we could agree on quickly. Mexican it is. I used Yelp to select Los Agaves. The restaurant itself is just the right of everything. Not too big, not too small. Not too fancy, not too casual. It was a little pricier than we wanted, but I also accept responsibility for over ordering. You order at the counter, get a number, and the food is delivered to your table. I was really craving fish tacos, so I ordered the Baja tacos off of the specials board. I also couldn't pass up the zucchini blossom quesadilla appetizer for $5. I had way, way too much food. But it was amazing. I'm certainly OK with any Mexican food standards (cheese enchiladas are my fave), but they really kick it up a notch there. We were all especially happy with the salad that comes with the entree. I just wish my stomach was bigger, because it saddened me tremendously that I couldn't eat everything I ordered. I would definitely come back if/when I get back to Santa Barbara.Service was very good, except a weird bit where after the other entrees came several different staff came to the table to find out what my order was. No big deal though. It arrived and it was hot and delicious.",5 star rating,Amy F.

2/23/2017,"Laguna Beach, CA",I have to try and eat somewhere different when choosing where to have dinner because this place is so good.

1/6/2014,"Encino, CA","Everything is yummy.Totally crowded with lines all the way to Los Angeles. I remember the days when only a few people knew about this lovely side street on this end of town. I have to admit customer service was great as was the food but the lines and noise was a little much. Great menu and their vegetarian selection was actually very good. Bright - clean - semi-comfortable dining area make this place fairly nice for a casual mexican place. If you are looking for a more traditional sit down and enjoy yourself kind of place, you might want to try someplace else.  Los Agaves was rush rush all the way and then stuff your face so the next customers could sit down.",4 star rating,Brian C.
7/5/2014,"WINNETKA, CA","This place gets packed! It's worth the wait, though. The food was flavorful and delicious. I went with my family so I was able to try a variety of their dishes. The ""cochinita pibil"" packs a punch; definitely not your typical Mexican hole in the wall dish. This thing is more authentic. The carne asada nachos are a great and filling appetizer. Also, I'd recommend the ""carne Azteca"" and the ""Tampiqueña.""",5 star rating,Jesse C.

8/25/2014,"Peoria, AZ","Absolutely exceptional. Absolutely. It's busy here for a reason; the food is divine. It's one of our favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara, and one of our favorite Mexican restaurants of all time. The salsa bar is exceptional, and we've enjoyed every dish that we've ever gotten here. So, you grab a menu, order, get a number and wait. ven though it feels like you're on your own, staff is walking around cleaning tables and checking to make sure you're happy. Once, my very picky son got a burrito with no cheese, and it ended up with cheese. He looked at the long line going out the door and looked forlorn.  We mentioned the cheesy burrito issue to staff, and he took care of it for us without having to get up from the table. Pretty sure he made the second burrito even bigger to compensate for the issue. All of the staff we've encountered here are really helpful, kind, and friendly.",5 star rating,Katie Z.
3/27/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","This classic, affordable, Mexican restaurant was packed on Saturday night.  Though the line was out the door, it moved fast.  Order your food at the counter, then you'll be given a number, which will allow you to choose a table in one of the three rooms. (They frown on selecting one before you order.) Creating your own combo with rice and beans is a great deal (1 item $8.95    ~    2 items $11.25    ~    3 items $13.50).  I ordered a delicious soft beef taco and a beef enchilada.  The food was beautifully plated, and the portions were ample.  Take advantage of the free salsa bar, and try a variety of sauces with the hot chips that arrive while you're waiting for your meal.  Make sure you receive the right one!  My friend ordered a cheese enchilada, and they brought her a beef one twice!  It was so busy that my other dining companion was given another customer's burrito.  My pals, who frequently eat here, were surprised by the mix-ups since they've never happened in the past.  The friendly servers promptly corrected the mishaps, and we all enjoyed our dinner.  They also provided take-home containers for most of us, who became too full to clean our plates.  Even the hungriest person at the table was satiated.  Fun and filling!",4 star rating,Kathryn L.

10/11/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Yum! This place has some really delicious Mexican fare! After trouncing around the zoo a friend and I came here for our lunch, and it was definitely the right thing to do.I had the chile relleño burrito and a horchata, and both were scrumptious. The burrito had the perfect blend of beans, chile, and cheese inside and the pink sauce on it (the ingredients of which I'm sure are a coveted secret) was mouthwateringly good. The horchata was cool and refreshing, and not the least bit gritty (unlike others I've had).The setup is a little reminiscent of a fast food joint: you order and pay at the counter. The major difference (besides the food being good) is that then a server brings it to your table. Additionally, the parking is a little cramped, however, there is a lot so if you can get in it it's convenient. The bathroom was a single stall, which is terrible anywhere, but especially at a place where most of the meals include beans. If you're in Santa Barbara, and a fan if Mexican food you should definitely check out Los Agaves!",4 star rating,Elle E.
9/16/2013,"Thousand Oaks, CA","This place is rad, and it's the perfect location to grub on amazing Mexican food before a concert at The Bowl. I always judge a Mexican joint by their tamales and this place delivered the goods. The batter was not too heavy and had just the right amount of sweetness. I love that they offer chicken tamales if you're not in the mood for swine. We also shared the enchiladas suizas and the sauce they used was fantastic. They have an enormous specials menus, so you are certain to find something that makes your taste buds cha cha. Cheers",5 star rating,Reed T.

7/17/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Amazing food and before I gave them 5 stars, but their burritos have been getting smaller and smaller and were VERY salty in my last several visits. Their prices have been skyrocketing as well, which has made me less-inclined to go as often. Also, there's too much of a rush for them to ask to take your plate away before you're done with your food, which is a bit annoying. I understand they need to have turnover to make more money, but with their restaurants doing as well as they are I wish they could be a bit more classy and courteous in this regard to their customers.Giving 3 stars for their good food and overall good service though.",3 star rating,Sam M.

8/29/2013,"San Diego, CA","Best Mexican in Santa Barbara... there I said it.This place has a great charming atmosphere, excellent food and good service. It has become my once-a-week place to eat.The food:My husband and I order the Burrito Mojado with Steak and the Enchiladas Guadalejaras with steak- both are fantastic. On the Enchiladas there is a delicious verde sauce that is so flavorful. The burrito comes with a rojo sauce that is equally good. We order our food with black beans (instead of pinto) and it really compliments the food well. Everything is super tasty and large portions.The service:You order your food up front, then sit down with a number and they bring it to your table. They usually come around with chips for you to try their salsas. Salsas are good, but many of them are ""roasted tomato"" which I'm not a fan of. I go for the verde tomatillo/avocado salsa that is spicy and delicious.Overall- excellent place to eat. Food is not expensive and you get what you pay for.",5 star rating,Megan T.

The cashier told us we should have called in our order and we told her we didn't know it was so busy and she said, ""we're always busy"" in a rude way.I suppose if you were a local you would know that, but we were from out-of-town. It left a sour taste in our mouth, but we paid and waited and waited. After about 25 minutes we got our food.

9/20/2016,"Santa Clarita, CA","Great food given other choices in Santa Barbara but we experienced terrible service/attitudes. We ordered food at the register and the person taking the order was a middle aged Hispanic guy, wearing a nice shirt with one too many buttons undone, little glasses placed at the end of his nose and a big attitude problem.  I am guessing he was the manager or maybe the owner. There were 4 of us. 2 of us placed the order while 2 of us got seats. We ordered a lot of food. For some reason this irritated this guy. He looked annoyed and the tone in which he spoke to us was obviously one of irritation. He didn't smile and was generally rude. No clue why, our ordering was seamless with no hiccups or special requests. I ordered an horchata, which was luke warm. I asked him for a small cup to put some ice in and the guy just stared at me. I repeated my request at which point he just pointed to the small plastic cups, signaling for me to take one. Didn't say a word. I guess I wasn't worthy of him using the energy to speak. I honestly don't know what this guys problem was but his attitude was totally uncalled for and unprofessional. We just dropped $120 on food and we get an attitude just because he was annoyed to take a large order?  Moving on....There were 4 of us. We ordered 2 appetizers and 5 entrees. The wait staff brought us other customers orders THREE TIMES, while failing to bring all of our order at once. I assume our orders were being brought to other people's tables by error during this time. One of our orders was wrong all together and had to be remade.  The wait staff was completely discombobulated and unorganized. They let empty plates pile up until we had to ask them to clear space. I get it. It's small. It's packed. It's busy. We've all had bad days that test our patience with other people. I feel like the lack of Mexican food choices in Santa Barbara is limited and that is why this place is rated so well. Having such a great rating causes them not to care about their service and how they treat customers filling their pockets. They're one of the only good spots in town and they know it. Having said that, poor service always trumps good food for me. I wouldn't return here based on a terrible attitude problem by this guy and the poor service to boot.",2 star rating,Joel S.
3/15/2014,"Tokyo, Japan","A Santa Barbara institution. Los Agaves always offers a variety of freshly prepared menu items that pack a real punch in terms of flavor and seasoning. My only complaint is that the portion sizes are far beyond anything I could hope to consume in a single sitting. But that doesn't mean they skimp on the flavor or quality. When I crave some good California Mex, this is where I go.",4 star rating,Matthew S.
12/28/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Don't sit in the table by the window in the afternoon. Scorching hot!!!Other than that we LOVED LOVED LOVED the food!  I really wish there was one of these on my side of town.  It is so unassuming in it's cafeteria style-esque ordering, it's numbers for the tables, and it's salsa bar.  Don't be fooled.  The long lines don't lie.  The food is fantastic.  Some of the best guacamole I have ever had and the fish tacos are outstanding. My husband had the chicken chimichanga and it was out of this world.  He ate it all with the exception of the gigantic couple of bites I had.  The beans and rice were perfection. In case you haven't read my other Mexican restaurant reviews, that is my gauge for a good Mexican restaurant.  Your food is likely to be subpar if you can't even get the beans and rice right.Just go here.",4 star rating,Kat H.
9/18/2016,"Chattanooga, TN","Javier's was recommended to us while staying in Newport Beach.  I tried to make reservations by phone, but was told they won't reserve a table for two on the weekend and that the wait was likely to be an hour or longer.  Since it was so highly recommended, we decided to show up and wait.  Low and behold, we got there, went up to get on a list, and the hostess said, ""oh, no wait, where would you like to sit?""!From the time we were seated at our outside table with a view (the outside is completely enclosed, but since it was during sunset, it was still a pretty view), to the time we left, the experience was outstanding.We started with a couple of outstanding margarita cocktails....fresh ingredients, and great combinations of flavors).  The only app we got was guacamole, which was very good.  But our entrees were both really good.  Hubby got carnitas and I got steak pidio",5 star rating,Toni M.

12/22/2016,"Ventura, CA","I eat Los Agaves about two times a week on average because I crave the Enchiladas Guadalajara with green sauce like nobody's biz. The salsa is always amazing, the chips are never greasy, and as someone with a dicey stomach for Mexican food,  I never feel sick after eating Los Agaves. I attribute this to their fresh ingredients. Everyone who works at this location is very accommodating despite the fact that the line is out the door most of the time. We usually order take out and our order is always correct! I have eaten Mexican food my entire life and Los Agaves is my favorite for authentic, delicious Mexican food.",5 star rating,Sarah A.
9/13/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","To start, after ordering at the counter and being brought chips and salsa (even though it was technically breakfast), the service was incredible. No less than three people came by to ask how everything was and not in an annoying way. As for the food, I tend to eat very healthy and Mexican isn't my favorite. I can't say my meal was healthy but it was good. I had the Huevos Rancheros with Chile Verde. They had a salsa bar and it all seemed pretty fresh. The side of pinto beans that it came with was great. The breakfast potatoes with bacon were also pretty amazing.",4 star rating,Taylor S.
6/13/2015,"Port Hueneme, CA","My heart is both overjoyed and saddened on this day for my beloved city of Oxnard has finally met its Mexican food match. Before last night, I could say without a doubt that you could choose nearly any shopping center in Oxnard, no matter how small, and find a Mexican restaurant that could best your city's finest. Then... I walked into Los Agaves in Santa Barbara. My first thought... ""Here we go again. The overrated, over priced Mexican food of the unknowing."" My next thought was, ""Order at the register?...ok...I'm really good with that but not what I expected from an overpriced spot."" Next, ""damn, these prices are reasonable and these pics on yelp look damn good."" Everything else from there was outstanding. I had the land and sea molcajete that several people raved about in other reviews and it was one of the best things I've ever tasted. A couple of items we ordered came out a little off (soft taco instead of crunchy, etc.) but in every instance the mistake was corrected swiftly and with a smile. In the end, it was A+ service, A+ food and A+ prices. The valedictorian of Mexican food.Try it or diet final word:This one is a no brainier. 4 point O status. Do it. Eat here.",5 star rating,Michael R.

10/20/2013,"Irvine, CA","This review is solely based off of two dishes. First dish being the Alambres, which is a fresh corn tortilla topped with carne asada, green peppers, onions, and cheese. Actually, saying it's topped with cheese is an understatement....it is smothered in cheese. I scraped off a big glob of cheese, and the tacos were still too cheesy. For me, the amount of cheese really kills it because the whole dish became a little oily. Couldn't finish it. GF got some kind of chicken torta, which was very good. Lightly breaded chicken with beans, avocado, lettuce and tomato. The chicken was cooked very well and the bread was awesome too.",3 star rating,Joe V.
12/14/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Oh my god this is literally the best Mexican food I've ever had. I'm usually into street tacos (the lighter side of Mexican food), but their steak burrito mojado is to die for. Every bite is just gooey rich creamy goodness. What the fuck is in that sauce I need to know. Even the steak is gooey and rich and creamy. Oh my god I want to eat five of them. Also comes with bombass Mexican rice and perfect guacamole. And when you're waiting for your food to come out the salsa bar has goodass avocado salsa and pico de gallo. I'd get onions and cilantro from there too and sprinkle it all over my wet burrito for that extra crunchy oomph.I'm coming here everytime I go to SB no joke. Come at unusual meal times cause it gets crowded. I love that you order at the counter and get your salsas and drinks on your own so you can eat at your own pace. Pace yourself. You will die of happiness. And then sadness when you eat all your food and hate yourself.",5 star rating,Shawna C.
8/19/2013,"Carlsbad, CA","What a revelation! This is the kind of Mexican food restaurant that could thrive in Mexico City. Everything from the Nachos to the Sopes to the Molcajetes was prepared with an almost artisinal flair. The sauce enrobing the enchiladas was sublime. The husk on the tamale was like your abuela made it for you at Christmas. The guacamole retained the nutty goodness of the avocados it was plucked from.  The tortillas de maiz were so chewy and of such a consistency that they tasted nothing like the corn tortillas we are so accustomed to north of the border. They soaked up the various salsas (beware...there was one at the salsa bar that would make a vaquero cry) with a sponge-like quality that only added to the greatness that was our meal. They accomodate vegans well and the service was up to par for such a busy restaurant. This was one outstanding meal and I'll count the days until I can get back there for another run at the menu. If you're in SB and you want Mexican, GO HERE!!!",5 star rating,Larry C.
4/9/2009,"Santa Barbara, CA","""Pear soaked in sangria, girl.""That, and a photo of this alleged pear soaked in sangria, was about all it took for me to make the slog over to Los Agaves. I wasn't the only person feeling that inspiration, either. At 8 pm at night, the place was packed with diners. Lots of families, couples, and even a few couger packs. I don't know, maybe it was book club night or something. Or they were there to ogle the owner's hotness. His hotness even chatted with me. It went something like, ""Hi, what would you like to order?""Har har har. Joking aside, ordering at the counter was a daunting task, not just because the menu has all sorts of exotica you don't see at bog standard Mexican restaurants, but also because the passageway from the kitchen to the tables is this teeeensy little opening next to the register, so ordering is like, ""aaaaah, I'll have....oh, am I in your way? Okay, can I get....oops, I'll move back over here. Oh, question, what comes in the....ouch, my foot."" And so on. But I survived the song and dance. And I ordered a molcajete, that lavarock mortar thingie heated to volcanic temperatures and filled with a rich stew and fillings of your choice ranging from vegetables, meat, or seafood. I opted for the ""earth and sea"" combination. I like that phrase, much better than Surf n' Turf. The salsa bar is delish, even offering nopales, or cactus, salad. Chips were light and crunchy, a little heavy handed with the salt, but that didn't stop me from eating them. I was accidentally served someone else's molcajete, but that's okay, because it was still BOILING and untouchable when the misdirected dish was discovered and whisked away many minutes later. My own molcajete was indeed stuffed with all sorts of goodies - shrimps, white fish, chicken, beef and pork. Absolutely stuffed. And served alongside soft freshly made tortillas.All this for $13 and I took home over half of it. My friend got the chicken salad, and while nobody would call it ""authentic"" it is perfect for Santa Barbarans. Fresh mixed market greens, dried fruits and nuts, a sweet tangy dressing and yes, that pear soaked in sangria that was ambrosia in my mouth. A few other notes:Interior is well-decorated, with sellable art on the walls. Think Fresco of Mexican food. You can bring your mother-in-law types here.Cannot have a quiet chat to save your life in there, it is LOUD.Axxess card deal! Portions are big. Too big for me, frankly, but I know some people love that gut-busted feeling.Bullet holes or something in the window, I don't know, to keep you grounded.",4 star rating,Lemonjelly L.

6/27/2013,"Irvine, CA","One of the recent reviews said this place ruined Mexican food for me, and i couldn't agree more. This place was so delicious that is has become the new measuring stick for other mexican places. Its seriously so good that as i write this im eating the leftovers of my room temperature burrito because my hotel room has no microwave, and its STILL DELICIOUS. I got the fajita burrito, and it was amazing. Some people prefer more steak in theres, (my girlfriend thought it had too much beans/cheese) but i still had steak in every bite. The freshness of the veggies, guac, sour cream and steak was amazing. You could literally taste the freshness. My girlfriend got the mojito burrito with green sauce on top, and that was also delicious. The only things I did not like about this place is the rice (it was mediocore) and the prices. The prices are intimidating at first for  aplace thats not a sit down place but the food is well worth it!",5 star rating,Mitun S.
6/13/2011,"Santa Maria, CA","We had dinner at Los Agaves, as we were in the area for a concert at SB Bowl, and we wanted to limit our pre-concert festivities to some place close by for our convenience. Our friends heard Los Agaves was a decent place, and La Super-Rica had a line out the door . . . good karma, as we had an excellent meal at Los Agaves! PROS: Festive environment--the diners seemed happy w/ their environs; friendly staff who were more than accommodating to help our foursome get a table on a very busy Saturday; pretty damn good chow--better than any Mexican I've gotten in North SB County--we all shared, and the beef taquitos were tasty and perfectly done, the seafood burrito tasted fresh, not fishy; nice and flavorful salsa selections CONS: this place is a little loud, and you may have to strain to hear and raise your voice to be heard; be prepared for a line, albeit not too bad a wait Food was yummy, service was very good, beer was cold, and our fellow patrons helped combine for a lively and enjoyable atmosphere!

2/18/2014,"Portland, OR","This was a bust for us. We were visiting SB for the day and came here based on Yelp reviews. The line, although manageable, was out the door and the restaurant was extremely busy on a Sunday night. My husband ordered the enchiladas agave which came with a spicy, creamy sauce - delectable. My dish, the molcajetes with shrimp, was impossible to eat. It came out *boiling* as if it had actually been cooked in the molcajetes (rather than the cooked ingredients being placed in the pot to remain hot). Just not pleasant or enjoyable. After 35 minutes, it was still searing hot and I repeatedly checked underneath for a heat source - it just didn't make sense that something could retain heat for so long as to be inedible.  Everyone elses plates looked great, so I might consider Los Agaves again when I'm back in SB.",3 star rating,C N.

What we got totally exceeded our expectations!I got the Garden Burrito and though not the most ""ethnic"" item on the menu, it was pretty damn good. Their guac was super fresh and totally made dinner all the better. LOVE the decor and setup! Their customer service was incredible and you can tell they legitimately care about their patrons. There were two busboys in particular who went above and beyond in terms of kindness and service (wish I'd gotten their names!).

6/6/2013,"Irvine, CA","I was craving Mexican food on a visit to Santa Barbara, so I asked my family for a good spot and Los Agaves was their recommendation.Even though I lived in SB for years I never knew this spot was tucked away on Milpas.  We came around one, and it was pretty busy but they moved fast, The staff was great with assisting us in finding a table in the busy lunch rush.We were seated and served fresh chips. This was a nice touch, as you typically do not get fresh chips in a fast food type restaurant. They have a nice salsa bar too with a variety of mild to hot salsas.We all ordered something different and everything was great. I had a chicken enchilada with rice and beans which was absolutely delicious. It tasted authentic and the sauce had a great flavor. My dad had chicken and beef tacos, and he loved them. My mom had a chicken burrito (that was huge btw) and she said it was excellent.Overall I was very impressed with this place. the food was fresh, and tasted like authentic homemade Mexican food, not like your run of the mill places (*cough* Acapulco *Cough*)Staff was very friendly and moved things along fast despite being busy.

4/15/2013,"Newport Beach, CA","This is one of the busiest restaurants I have ever been to, especially considering Santa Barbara is not a huge city!The restaurant itself is located a little off the beaten path with a small parking lot. Luckily we were able to find parking on a side street, which was just a short walk away.The place was packed, and I mean so much so that there was almost no room to stand. It is good that the staff does seem to have a system in place for seating patrons and they seem to turn over tables quickly. The food itself is very good. I had the mole enchiladas with a side of chips and guacamole. The mole sauce was rich and flavorful and the chicken in the enchiladas was seasoned excellently. The guac was also very fresh as were the chips and salsa. The salsa bar actually has a multitude of choices from mild to hot which is nice.The only reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel because of the small dining area, and the enormous crowds, they should switch from order at the counter and get your own drinks to table side service. It is just too chaotic and hectic as it is and it is a struggle to even get yourself to the soda/water fountain or salsa bar when it is a packed time of day.Despite the crowds, this is a 5 star establishment based on food alone and is worth coming back to.",4 star rating,Sandy M.

I came here with my g/f for dinner and while she was getting close to the front of the line I went and grabbed a table because the place was super busy. I had a worker ask me if she was close to ordering to which I said ""yes"" and she proceeded to leave me alone. Next thing I know there's another worker there telling me I need to give up my table because there are other people who need a table. I tell them that's too bad and not my problem they didn't send someone ahead to grab a table. He continued to stand there and that's when I made the decision to not give this POS business a dime of my money. I've never been so offended at a restaurant in my life.A word of advice to the managers/owners, figure out how to run your business....1. You're either a sit down restaurant or a fast food restaurant, not both. If In N Out is busy, common practice is you send one of your party members to grab a seat so you can sit down and eat. Same thing applies in your restaurant...2. Teach your employees some manners and tact, your employee was lucky I didn't lay him out on the way out of your shit hole establishment.This place pissed me off so bad it's a month later and I still remembered I need to leave them a bad review.",1 star rating,Aaron S.

12/20/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA",We have had a great dinner last night steak burrito and crispy tacos. The best party was the FREE warm and tasty nachos. The variety of sauces were awesome.

9/11/2014,"North Vancouver, Canada","Amazing food with a huge selection of daily features. A nice basket of tortilla chips and wide variety of self serve salsas while you wait for your food. Hubby ordered the fish tacos (he wanted the beef tongue special but they just sold out), which was one of the best we've had. The battered fish held up whereas most places ends up soggy halfway through. I ordered the sea and earth Molcajetes and it was everything and more I expected. Good amount of heat in the sauce, the giant prawns were fresh, got to taste a variety of their meats. Highly recommended!",5 star rating,Cathy C.

My husband was waiting in line to order so I asked one of their staff if we could sit in a table of four, he seemed to be ok with it, but suddently another staff sat another party.. I was amazed how rude and unprofessional they acted.. Food was very cold and bad.. I def give them 0000 stars, I do not recommend this place at all!! Too expensive mex food. Not worth it~",1 star rating,Early Bird Flea Market C.
5/12/2014,"Oakland, MD","Came by after work to find out what is so great about Los Agaves. The reviews made it seem like it was a fine dining establishment. It was pleasant to see that it is fine-dining without the pretentiousness of ""fine-dining"". You order at the register and they bring the food to your table. The restaurant interior is Spanish adobe style and just an overall nice place to relax and enjoy your meal because the food here is worthy of your attention. Every occupied table seemed to have a delicious dish that made it difficult to decide my order. I ended up ordering the Land and Sea Mocaljete. It's one of those dishes you see someone eating that make you say, ""Oh, I wanna try that."" It was delicious and fun going through the mocaljete and finding out with each spoonful what you're about to eat. It could be a jumbo shrimp, chorizo, or fish. The mocaljete also comes with fresh, warm tortilla. All orders come with complimentary chips; and there is a salsa bar with 7 different salsas, as well as fresh cilantro, lime, chopped onions, and jalapenos.This is one of those restaurants that you should try multiple times because there are a lot of different dishes that look really good.",5 star rating,J C.
4/22/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA",Only been here once and ordered just plain chicken tacos.  Everything tasted very fresh and would definitely eat here again.  The only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is the price.  It is a little pricier than I would like for the portion you receive.,4 star rating,Kaila P.
8/17/2014,"London, United Kingdom",Long walk away from the busy downtown of Santa Barbara. There was long line to get in which is not always the best for people who have been starving.Good informal restaurant with basic Mexican fare. The grilled Mahi Mahi was a wee bit over done and therefore chewy. Seafood fajitas were great. Cleanliness definitely not a strength but the staff is really helpful and friendly.,4 star rating,Jalaj H.
5/9/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","One of the best two Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara.  Food is fresh, healthy, and full of flavor.  Salsa bar is amazing (Chipotle salsa is the best).   Check out the specials board as well as the regular menu.   Pork Shank is worth a try if it is on the specials board.  Also, the mole sauce is the best in Santa Barbara.   Carne Azteca...so good and low carb!It gets super busy on weekends and parking is a problem, but worth it.  Great value for money and great food every time.",5 star rating,Van H.

2/14/2016,"Palmdale, CA","Been to this place twice now, and it is absolutely amazing.  I've had a LOT of Mexican food, and this is hands down the best I've ever had.  Flavors are absolutely unbelievable.  Only issue is that requesting extra rice or beans costs an extra $3, which is pretty ridiculous.  But I'll keep the 5-star review, seeing as they have a massive unlimited salsa bar of some of the best salsas you will ever taste.  Prices are very reasonable as well, with most non-special meals being under $12 (including chips and the salsa bar).  100% recommend.",5 star rating,Sean M.

2/21/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Had a horrible experience here on Monday for lunch. I come here all the time and have never experienced such rudeness, disrespect and lack of service. There were 4 of us for lunch and 2 of us were served within 10 minutes. The other two orders had not arrived after 20 minutes. Half the table were almost done. I got up, found a server, and tried to explain what was going on. The server couldn't have been less concerned and was annoyed that I was bothering him. Unbeknownst to me, another person at my table had approached a different server to lodge a similar complaint. Come to find out that she responded in the same way. Five more minutes had passed and we were about to ask for our money back when the server arrived saying, ""Careful, hot plates"". Not only were the plates cold, so was the food. When I flagged down the server again, he was beyond pissed off at my complaint. He took the plates away and returned them 5 minutes later saying ""Hot plates"". Again, the plates were not hot but the food was. Great! Nope. The restaurant must have stuck our food in the microwave or something because while the food was hot, the seafood was over cooked. I have been dining at the Milpas location since it opened as I live down the street. The owners know me by sight. My guests and I will not be returning.",1 star rating,Alison G.

10/6/2013,"Burbank, CA","YooHoo..Me and my friend, we went here today (Sunday) at 1 PM, we came from L.A. btw. It wasn't too crowded but by the time we got there, in the next half an hour, yes, the line was way too long up to the front door. Good stuff, as we come from LA, they have their own parking lot which I believe it fits for around 12 cars. They dont serve you from the table, you have to order it from the counter, and get your water/soda from the side of the counter. They have different menus, they have their menu on the board right on the top of the cashier table and the foldable menu.They have complimentary chips and also you can get free salsa sauce and spicy green chilli sauce, which I always mix them up together with the chip, and taste much better. The food came up pretty fast, like 10-ish mins, less than 15mins. I had Agaves Enchiladas (around $13 with tax), with shrimp and fish inside and the sauce taste sooo delicious.. I am not a really big fan of Mexican food because I don't like beans, but this food rocks my mouth..yums! Served with salad on the side with some fresh oranges and the yummy rice. So delicious.. My friend couldn't finish her food, I don't really remember her order, she got burritos and she really enjoyed and liked her food. I finished my food but that's because I didn't have breakfast that day and had been walking around at the Santa Barbara zoo. They have restroom but just one for each. The place is divided to 2 sections, good enough to pack all the crowd..up to 75-80 people probably...The atmosphere is casual, located around the corner, the sign of the restaurant is pretty small and the parking is located on the back, kinda tricky. There is no sign of parking, or..maybe I just didn't see it.",4 star rating,Michaela A.
6/2/2015,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",Food is OK.  The people are great and it's in a wonderful part of town.  Would much rather have had drinks and apps.  The meals are a bit bland and not really worth the moderate pricing.  In California you gotta be spot on with your Mexican food or just go Italian.,2 star rating,Jason L.

2/3/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I am giving it 4 stars because I have nothing bad to say (taste wise) about the restaurant.I have a confession to make, and that is I am not fond of Mexican food... but didn't grow up in Cali, so never got used to the taste... Our friends that just have moved to Boston missed good Mexican food, and I couldn't say no...I have tasted Mexican food many times and only have come across few dishes that I like... definitely the seafood dishes are my favs.So, like a good seafood fan I ordered ""Los Camarones a la Diabla""... I was bold and asked if they could do it without the diabla (which is female for diablo, devil) meaning without being spicy. They said yes... but BEWARE, no Authentic Mexican understand the meaning of no spicy.So, I wasn't able to really enjoy the dish (the shrimps were fresh)... the salad in the other hand; was incredible delicious.My husband ordered the Molcajete with Chiken. The restaurant forgot his order, so the poor hungry bast*** had to wait longer... (and didn't come with the molcajete anyways, which is a kind of stone bowl). it was pure punishment 'cause he likes Mexican food, and it is never an option between the two of us.",4 star rating,Cela V.

2/13/2018,"Hawthorne, CA","2/8/18 we went to Los Agaves at 8:30pm they close at 9. They said you made it in time you can order and eat and stay as long as you want, but we close and lock the doors at 9 so no one else will come in. It's a nice little spot. You order and pay for your food at the counter, then you get all of your different salsas at the salsa bar, then you have a seat and someone brings your food to your table. I loved all of the art work they had displayed, the flooring and light coverings are beautiful. The  service was good, they were very attentive and kept asking if we needed anything else or more chips. That was really nice that they let us in. Especially since a lot of places close at 9 pm in Santa Barbara. The food was really good and the salsa bar and the guacamole is out of this world. If you don't get anything but guacamole and chips and salsa accompanied by a blood orange margarita you would be very happy!!! Although their tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, and molé are very good. This is a good place to have Mexican Food!",4 star rating,No W.

You place your order at the register and your food is brought out to the table when it's ready. The food is fresh and good size portions. They also have a salsa bar which is necessary at a Mexican restaurant. Too bad they only have one restroom each for men & women. You'll have to wait if it's occupied.

I went to go to the salsa bar, and the line was out the door! I guess we were lucky to find a parking spot in the back.The only downside, I felt really rushed. I had two people ask me if I wanted a box while I still clearly had a fork and knife in my hand, and was in the middle of a bite.

Immediately someone came over, corralled us to a table, took our order, set us up with chips, brought our drinks, took our credit card - AWESOME service. Already loving this place before the food even arrived... Then the salsa bar - usually tired, expected offerings at other places, but not here. The four of us each had a different favorite - all were phenomenal. Then came the food: mole, mahi mahi, carne asada - home runs, all.

We came during the peak time and it was so busy that it was hard to see if there was any available tables after ordering at the counter. I ordered some vegetarian tacos, and the guy who made the vegetarian suggestion had way too many peppers and onions in it. I was kind of craving avocados, but I didn't get any in my food. It made me really miss the cheap Bushwick spot I go to in NYC.The food did come out fairly quickly and a man brought it over to our table with our coordinating number.

12/28/2018,"La Mirada, CA","Had lunch here about 4 years ago and really liked the food.  Decided to brave the 3 - 4 hour drive to Santa Barbara during the holidays for the sole purpose of dining here again.  Was terribly disappointed.  Ordered the Agaves Enchiladas (which I had the last time) hoping to re-live the sumptuous meal... took more than 15 minutes to get the order.  Repeatedly asked the waiter to check, and when it finally came it was cold and soggy.  Last time, I ordered the same and the enchiladas were so soft and creamy you could slice thru it with a plastic fork - this time the shell/covering was chewy and the edges were hard.  The fish (?) in it was hard and chewy as well as if it just came out of the freezer, and the shrimps just didn't look like - well shrimps.  Had to use a knife to cut thru the enchiladas and when that didn't work ended up using my hands - it was just a mess.  The salad and rice that came with the meal was all over the plate.  It just seemed like the whole meal was just slapped together and flung at your table.  My wife and son (ordered enchilada and burrito) weren't too thrilled with their meals as well.  Looked over some of the orders at the other tables and it just seemed like - well like I said, as if the food was just slapped together on the plate.  Really didn't look very appetizing.   Also - and this became a game with us - the servers had this masterful way of avoiding eye contact with the customers so that they don't have to respond to any of your requests.  Their main job was to plunk the order on your table and that was it.  Needless to say nobody won the game of hailing any of the servers to cater to our needs.  Maybe it was just the horrendous drive to Santa Barbara (and the equally tortuous drive back)...  but we paid good money to drive and re-live and enjoy the dining experience and it was a 100% disappointment.    This place no doubt has earned its reputation and success... but I think it has outgrown its success and has become a classic example of ""success spoils"".",1 star rating,J V.

9/26/2010,"Goleta, CA","I have come here 4 times now during late morning on a Saturday, so it was not yet crowded. The salsa bar is excellent, and the free chips are hot and fresh--so much so that you could get too full on 'em even before your order arrives.The place is casual--order at the counter, and they bring the food to your table.I have enjoyed:chile relleno-fresh, yummy, cheesyshredded beef sopeschicken enchiladasflavorful rice and beans (but I think the little crispy corn tortilla cup the beans are served in are tacky and look like they came out of a package--please stop serving them)I did not enjoy the huevos rancheros served with chile verde. The eggs, ordered over easy, came out medium well. They re-made my order fairly graciously, but the dish lacked flavor, mostly due to the fact that the chile verde consisted of lackluster sauce, and a single large chunk of un-tender pork. I would have preferred smaller chunks of tender, flavorful meat in tangy, spicy green chile sauce. Service is pretty good, but again, I have only been there when it was less than half-full, so there wasn't an opportunity for staff to be over-worked.Overall, good food, good value, pleasant surroundings.",4 star rating,Trish W.

Normally I don't finish all the rice, but this time I finished it up. It was fragrant and had a seafood flavor in it. Hubby got the Agave burrito.

I'm sure this place won't let you down. Yeah people can get a little frustrating with seating but honestly its worth it and having worked in the food and beverage industry for 7 years trust me the team is doing the best they can to sit you down ASAP and give you chips and salsa for your dinning pleasure so just grab a beer when you order and learn to relax if a table does not open within 5 minutes.,5 star rating,Lili M.

I'd rather be seated first so I don't feel rushed to order and get a table afterward, but don't get me wrong they did a pretty damn good job getting everyone's food out as quickly as possible and it was great quality food. Don't think I waited more than 10 min and I don't think multiple parties of 7+ waited any longer than 15 min.

5/28/2013,"West Lafayette, IN","3.5 Coming from Northern California, we definitely wanted to get some Mexican food in SB and this place had the best reviews.   The line was out the door when we came but it moved quickly.  You order at the counter, are given a number and your food is brought to you.  My husband had a beef chimichanga (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) and I had a tostada salad (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  The prices are quite reasonable, the total for both was around $19.  The dishes here are beautifully presented.  As we were waiting in line to order, every dish that came by looked postively mouth-watering.  Our food itself was tasty but not particularly amazing.  I thought my husband's chimichanga was pretty average, although I did love the spanish rice that came topped with crumbled cheese (all rice should be served with crumbled cheese on top).  My salad was ok.  I didn't care for their version of refried beans, which had the beans whole in some sauce, instead of mashed up.   Also the advertised avocado in my salad was instead gaucamole, which was too cilantro-y for me.  I got my hopes up for avocado slices, which I prefer.  The salad was also a little too layered.   I wish they had tossed it more so I could have had more bites that had more than one ingredient.    The chicken slices were nicely marinated though, and very plentiful.   Service was very friendly and they bring you baskets of complimentary chips (there's a salsa bar for you to choose your own salsas).   I thought the chips were a little stale.  I have no doubt that this is very authentic Mexican as others say, I just like my Mexican a little more Americanized I guess.",4 star rating,A M.

At first I was a little thrown off by ordering at the counter because that usually means you have to fight for a table, but they way they do it is great. You wait in line and order your food and when it is difficult to find a table, the staff helps you and everyone who works there is really quite lovely.

9/11/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","This review is specifically for their online ordering failure and management lack of customer service. Last Monday I ordered to-go from their Yelp page. It said 55 minute ....a while but we waited. My husband goes to pick up, waits in the line out the door and is told they don't have the order. Angry, he leaves. He arrives home upset and I confirm that the order was sent to the correct location and I was charged. I call, speak with the manager and he apologizes and says he'll issue a refund that day. Fast forward a week, no refund. I call back...I'm put on a long hold and speak to manager Ray. He apologizes and tells me he'd have the corporate office call me the next morning. More days go by, nothing. Today, I call and speak with Manager Alex who quite very unapologetically tells me to call the third party who Los Agaves uses to process online orders. Unacceptable. Your customer should not be given the run around for your error. This is horrible customer service and 1 of 3 managers should've been able to correct their error. I was told, sorry these things happen because we're really busy. Again, unacceptable. Turn off your online ordering if you're unable to fulfill your customers orders. I've been a regular customer since the beginning and I'm very discouraged to think that with growth you've lost what used to be phenomenal customer service.",1 star rating,Sal S.

Layers of flavor all the way through with different sauces inside and out. And the final cherry on top was the salsa bar. There were like 10 to choose from and everyone was flavorful and standalone.

And the severs will keep on coming around asking if you're okay, and if you need anything. ... So their sevice is good despite how crowded it was. I made sure to leave them a tip.The food is really good. And they have several types of salsa u can choose from their salsa bar. Their definition of ""mild"" is way different than mine. ... The ones that were labled ""mild"" were extremely hot for me. Maybe I just don't take to spicy food well.All in all, i really enjoyed myself here. I'll come back next time i'm in santa barbara.",4 star rating,Anne F.
8/3/2014,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA","Maybe we ordered poorly and/or came on an off day, but our experience here was very disappointing considering all the rave reviews. Came for Sunday lunch. They were not accommodating to my boyfriend's vegetarianism. This place is NOT vegetarian-friendly. When the cream in my coffee curdled, the server told me nothing was wrong with the coffee and he didn't know what I did to it.  Sorry for messing up your coffee, bro. Found the food bland and unremarkable. The generous guacamole serving and tasty salsa were the only redeeming qualities. Not coming back.",2 star rating,Megan D.

5/7/2017,"Anaheim, CA",Stumble on this place accidentally. We were visiting Santa Barbara and we were getting hungry. Searched for a good restaurant and this place had lots of reviews. We tried agave enchiladas and fajita burrito. Boy!! From the salad and rice to salsa and the main dish.. it was phenomenal. The salsa mild is my fav. Tried the habanero.. but that's way too hot for us. The other green salsa is good too. But let me tell you about the enchilidas. It came w/ chipotle sauce on top.. oh my goodness. It was perfect. The fish/shrimp had good portion. They weren't stingy on the amount of fish they put in. My boyfriend had the burrito and on his first bite .. he goes.. you gotta try this.. it was good too but I really like the enchilada. But he looked like he enjoyed it and finished the whole burrito and kept raving about it as he was eating it. :) but man the salsa and chips - ahhhh pure goodness!!! Will definitely come back if we are in the area again. Nice staff and good service too!! 2 thumbs up!!!,5 star rating,Joy S.

Beer and fountain drinks. I ordered the Gringa el Pastore, my husband had the gigantic molcajetes dish, and my son the Agaves Burrito.

Since Los Agaves opened I haven't been back because, well, for the price, it's just the best damn Mexican cuisine in Southern California.

All their salsas are extraordinary.  The food was cooked to perfection.  A must eat at when in Santa Barbara.,5 star rating,Aaron P.
2/2/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","It's excellent.  Many dishes on the menu that you don't see other places.  There's a variety of freshly prepared salsas that are all really good.The format is you order and pay at the counter and they hand you a number that you take to your table.  This is critical, because THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A TABLE AVAILABLE after you order.  If you plan on eating there (vs. take out), make sure you have these logistics figured out to avoid a last minute table panic.Of course the fact that it's hard to get a table should tell you something about this place...a Mexican restaruant on a street with many other Mexican restaurants....it's GOOD.",4 star rating,Jarrett G.

2/23/2013,"Silverdale, WA",This place is awesome and the food is great as well.My only gripe was how crowded it was and how people just packed in.  They will keep selling food until people are literally standing over you waiting for you to leave.... Watching you eat.... The whole time.... and forget after dinner conversation or going back for more.. Eat your food and get out or they will stare at you until you do.This place will be on my list of places to go in the future but towards the bottom.

I'd eat salads every meal if they always came with their mango dressing.  Every plate I saw in the restaurant had generous portions.  Friendly staff and quick service with their sit-down / order line hybrid.  The only negative was the embarrassment I suffered leaving the restaurant with a raging erection from the amazing meal.,5 star rating,Aaron B.

Salsa bar was really tasty too - Caution the hot is ""ridiculously hot"".  Meals come with delicious guacamole and the rice wasn't just a 'filler' 'add on' either.

Beans and rice was very good.Ceviche Tostada-Halibut seemed dry and not fresh. The seasoning was sparse and not up to par. It almost seemed like it was premade and sitting in the refridge.Tacos Del Mar-Halibut was over cooked and dry, and the cabbage and mango didn't seem to help with the taste.Salsas-Green avocado sauce, too much cilantro, almost watery.Service-Excellent, long lines move very fast!

10/24/2012,"Venice, CA","I find no fault with these dudes. It's a nice restaurant, but you order up front, like in a taco shop. Then they give you a card for your table and you are served by waiters. That way you can leave when you are done and you don't have to wait for someone to bring you your bill. Nice. They will bring you some of the best chips around, and you get your own salsa from the salsa bar. The salsas are not run of the mill. They're all different and they are all special.I had the carne asada tacos. These tacos stand with the best. There's a period after that sentence.

The tortillas seemed to be homemade and were really soft. We both enjoyed our food. They have a salsa bar that they were continuously refilling.

We left with all the salsas bc we couldn't just throw them out. The free tortilla chips were great as well! We also got free guac bc the owner (at least we think it's the owner), asked us to move when we were already seated and eating tortilla chips and we did so she gave us free guac for moving!

3/17/2012,"Long Beach, CA","After a very long work day and before hitting the road back to LA, I decided to ""sit the traffic out"" and grab some dinner. I quickly accessed Yelp and found Los Agaves; read a few ""best Mexican in town"" comments and that was enough for me.Not knowing what to expect, I went with the Baja Tacos; one shrimp, one fish. As I waited for my meal, I shuffled up to the salsa bar and sampled a couple different salsas; very tasty.My food arrived a few minutes later and I was pleasantly surprised. The presentation was very upscale and colorful. My two nice size tacos also came with a fresh salad and rice. The plate had a contemporary feel to it. This is not old school Mexican, this is new skool foodie Mexican.I started with the salad which had an awesome, creamy dressing and was topped with mangos and dried cranberries; excellent. Then, I dug into the fish taco, which was very good. It was fried, which was a slight bummer, but it was an entire fillet and very hearty. The rice was also extremely good. By the time I actually got to the shrimp taco, I was stuffed. I ended up simply eating the shrimp vs the entire taco; this was a good size meal.Overall, I was very happy with my meal and never would have found this place without the help of Yelp. I will be back in SB again shortly and look forward to discovering more finds like Los Agaves!",4 star rating,Scott G.
7/28/2012,"Austin, TX","I was driving through SB and gave Los Agaves a try based on the great Yelp reviews.  Pollo en mole poblano is one of my favorite Mexican dishes, so this is what I ordered.  When it came to the table, it looked amazing.  It was a half chicken covered in the mole and served with generous portions of rice, beans, and corn tortillas. I will start with the chicken and mole.  To say it was incredibly bland would be a gross understatement.  The chicken itself seemed like it had no seasoning whatsoever.  I understand that the chicken is covered in a sauce, but that is not an excuse for not seasoning it.  Perhaps I would be more willing to overlook the chicken if the mole was better, but it, too, was pretty flavorless.  It had a very slight hint of chocolate and not much else.  I could not taste the chiles, the nuts, or any other ingredients I presume went into it.  Maybe using salt would have brought the flavors. This was highly disappointing.The beans were pretty average.  They were not great but far from bad.  The rice was actually pretty flavorful and good.  The best part of the meal was the tortillas. They were great handmade corn tortillas.  I would say that they are the best tortillas I have found in a restaurant in the US. It is a shame that I didn't have any food worth putting in the tortillas.",3 star rating,Matthew B.
4/1/2013,"Avila Beach, CA","Good solid 4.5+ spot. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Had the loaded nachos with cheese beans, salsa, guacamole, etc. Was so filling I hardly ate any of the meal. This is a truly authentic Mexican place. The food is prepared in an open kitchen. Not too Americanized, but comfortable enough for anyone. When we were there most of the customers spoke Spanish so that was a good sign.Good salsa bar selections. The food comes out really fast too.I had packed up a few things in to-go boxes, and was getting ready to leave. Stood up and took two steps and the guy behind the counter was already coming out with a bag to put them into for carry out. Never even had to ask, and they were very busy.",4 star rating,Dave P.

1/1/2013,"Huntington Beach, CA",Dinner time as we drove from Huntington Beach to Cambria.  Trusty yelper had great thing to say about Los Agaves so we stopped for dinner.  Fun spot for a casual dinner. You stand in line to order. The line moves very quickly so don't let the line discourage you. As it was our first time there many helpful suggestions from other in line who had been there before.  We went with the shrimp and fresh fish enchiladas and a carnitas burrito. Given how busy they were I was a bit nervous about finding a table. But a server pointed us to the back and an open table. When you go be sure to make several trips to the fresh salsa bar!   The burrito was good. But the enchiladas....delectable!  Fresh ingredients seasoned just right!  Highly recommend!,5 star rating,Samantha R.

I typically go to this restaurant once a week. That said, the line is always long, and it always takes a long time to order, which is frustrating and ruins the experience for me. Also, the employees seem to goof around with each other - which is not necessarily bad, but when you've been waiting for 25 minutes to order your food and the two cashiers are flirting with each other instead of taking your money, it gets upsetting. I love this restaurant, and if you have the time to wait, it's an excellent value.",4 star rating,Matthew F.

All their food is made fresh, hot, and consistently delicious! I've had most of their burritos and they are excellent. They are big and filling, and their meats are excellent! I love that their burritos and dishes come with sides of rice, beans, and guac/sour cream. I've also had their enchiladas and some of their special dishes, all very good. Price is average but 100% worth it. For the quality of the food, the value is absolutely there. Fast, competent, friendly service, great atmosphere, and their salsa bar is amazing.

8/15/2015,"Aloha, OR","Had lunch here today with my family while on a short trip to Santa Barbara. My daughter ordered the chicken taquito combo. The taquitos were good. They had cheese inside which was tasty and unexpected. The portions were big on her order. I had the combo with a chicken sope, chicken enchilada, and crispy beef taco with rice and beans. My food portions were also large. The shredded chicken and beef was moist and flavorful. I loved the sauce on my enchiladas. All the flavors went really well together. Husband had the bistec Azteca. Portions were small, especially compared to mine and my daughters plates, but he said the food was tasty. Although we all agreed the rice was a tad too salty. We mixed it with beans for our 2 year old. The salsas from the salsa bar were all delicious. The habanero salsa was hot!! Parking lot is small and a tight squeeze but we managed. I disliked that there were some flies in the dining area and the soda fountain looked like it was in need of a good wipe down. Otherwise, we enjoyed almost everything and would come back here.",4 star rating,Addie A.

4/22/2017,"Torrance, CA","My mom and I decided to try out this place since a friend of hers spoke highly of this place and recommended it to her.  I had the Huarache (with steak) and my mom had the Mole Enchiladas.  Food was good and so are the salsas.  Customer service though, that's a whole 'nother thing!!  Apparently, you get in line to order.  Then, you order and pay.  Then you get a number and THEN you can get a table.  Mind you, today is Saturday (we just left the place), it was super busy.  I stood in line and asked my mom to get us a table.  One of the waiters turned her away because she didn't have a number.  I made eye contact with the waiter and told him I was in line to order.  He said, ""I can't set up a table for you because you don't have the number"".  Fine!!!  My mom came back and stood in this looooong line until I got the number.  Well, not everyone plays by the rules, though.  Other customers were coming in and helping themselves to an empty table!!!!!!  WTHeck??!!!  By the time we were ready for a table, my mom approached ""Alejandro"" (not sure if this guy is a waiter or what- he wasn't wearing a uniform but was bringing food out from the kitchen) and asked if we could get a table... He said not until she had a number!!!  AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  At this point, I had had enough of this STUPID number thing!!!!  I snatched the STUPID number from my son's hand and showed it to Alejandro!!!!  I was so upset I wanted to just leave but I had already ordered my food and my son and daughter were hungry.  One of the waitress' walked by and asked if we wanted more chips and we said yes.  She emptied the basket of chips we already had into the one she was now giving us.  The way she did it, almost hit my daughter on the head!!!AHHHHHHH!!!  Another waitress walked by and we ask for two boxes... She left to make those boxes because she never came back!!  We were able to get the attention of another waiter and we finally got our boxes and left!!  Customer service is important for me, therefore, I won't be coming back or recommending this place to anyone I know.  I had a MUCH better experience at Casa Blanca... It's only about 5 minutes from here.  Should've gone there instead!!",3 star rating,Bee D.

We also had a side of nachos and these were probably the best nachos I ever had! Portion size is pretty big!",4 star rating,Shamsher S.

9/19/2014,"San Diego, CA",Great food and salsa bar. They definitely do not wimp down their hot sauces. The avocado salsa is the mildest aside from the pico de gallo. I had the mahi-mahi dish and it was cooked with love! The burrito Mojado is also very good!,5 star rating,Chris S.

12/21/2015,"San Jose, CA",This place is hopping.  Friendly service.  Bit noisy but good vibe.  Wide choice of food.  It is a casual place where you walk up to order food and they will deliver to your table.  Food is good but not extraordinary.  My review would have been 3.5 where I am not necessarily a fan of the place but I would probably try again if I am near the place.  Parking can be bit challenging.,4 star rating,Aden G.
8/10/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Delicious but didn't blow my mind. As it's usually the case with texmex, portions are ginormous.

3/25/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","This is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara.  What I love about Los Agaves is that their food is prepared using fresh ingredients and they provide generous portions that'll fill you up without making you feel sluggish or guilty for eating it.  The flavors are really tasty and light. Also, the people that work there are all nice.  I've never had a bad experience at Los Agaves and I've been there at least 15 times.Things to try: Sea & Earth molcajete to share and the Agaves Burrito.  The burrito comes with a salad and the mango dressing that they put over it is delicious! Note: -Order at the register before seating yourself.-They have a small parking lot behind the restaurant but you're better off finding street parkingWarning: going around noon can be quite crowded!",5 star rating,Phoenix Y.

12/18/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I'll first start off by saying that I absolutely love Los Agaves' food!  In fact, it's my go to spot for Mexican food and one of the top spots in Santa Barbara.  In my opinion their Nachos and Burrito Mojado are the best items on the menu but they also have delicious specials and also typical Mexican delights that are all full of flavor and very unique.  This uniqueness is what separates Los Agaves from other Mexican restaurants.  Their Salsa bar is a great side kick to their delicious food and provides a foodie's palate with plenty of options i.e. Avocado Salsa, Salsa Verde, Habanero, Salsa Fresca, Chipotle and many more.   I regress with my food love fest and will now focus on why I'm given them a 3 start review......SERVICE!!  Los Agave is a BUSY restaurant that pumps out food very fast, TOO fast.   When you first walk into the restaurant you'll have to deal with a long line just to order your food.  You'll start to sweat and get a little anxious like you're back in line waiting to get on Viper at Magic Mountain.  But it gets better.  Once you're finally able to order your food then it's time to fight a crowd in order to find a table.  Almost like you're in a mosh pit at a Korn concert but not as crazy.  First tip...once you order your food ask an employee to find a table for you, they are trained for this and will find a place for you to eat.  Second tip.  If you place an order to go by phone skip the wait line and hover around the register to pay and pick up your food.  When picking up this To-Go order make sure to check your food thoroughly.  I will repeat this again, check it  thoroughly because if you don't you'll probably go home with the wrong order.  Almost every time I place a to go order there's always something wrong with my food.  There have been multiple times where I've had to drive back to the restaurant and have them correct it.  So please do yourself a favor and check your order.  With all these issues with service, Los Agaves hands down is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I will continue to enjoy their food but will use my street smarts that I've leaned over the years of eating here to make it an enjoyable experience.  My final tip....If you ""can shower in a rifle barrel"" then you'll love Los Agaves because the portions are large and so are the tastes.",3 star rating,Brent W.
10/2/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA",This is not your typical greasy Mexican food restaurant. They have authentic quality food with many different items on the menu.

2/20/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA",Los Agaves is a hidden gem off of State St. for locals.  My wife and I have been bringing friends and family to this location since it opened up a few years back.  I love their nachos and carnitas burrito.  And their salsa bar is a nice touch.  The staff is extremely friendly there too.  We took our friend and his son for dinner one evening and the owner swings by and gives our friend's son a special cup of juice and came back later and asked if he wanted a refill.  This is a great spot for authentic Mexican food.,5 star rating,Gabe A.

4/9/2014,"San Luis Obispo, CA","My brothers, a friend, and I stopped here on the way up to Morro Bay for my brother's wedding. It was a typically warm, beautiful Southern California day and Mexican food sounded good (so did a Corona). We dropped in and seats were easy to come by. We waited in line for a minute or two before we ordered, pondering the chalkboard menu. Everything sounded so good! Because I'm on the pescetarian side of vegetarianism, I opted for fish tacos, salmon to be exact. The plate (with two tacos, rice, and salad) with a beer was around $11. Not too shabby. They have a salsa bar and their best is the avocado (aguacate) salsa. It was also the spiciest we had. I also grabbed the habanero salsa and their medium salsa. All had great flavor, but when there's avocado and it's spicy, that's where I'm hanging out. We got chips almost immediately.We waited maybe 7 minutes and the food started coming out. My salmon tacos were incredible! The salmon was cooked perfectly and charred just right so it was slightly crispy. The pineapple on the tacos was also grilled, adding a sweet and caramelized crunch to the tacos. the rice was very good, and I don't really like Spanish rice. This rice actually had flavor :) The side salad was good. It felt a bit out of place (mango and strawberries and a sweet dressing), but it was very good. I'm definitely bookmarking Los Agaves for future stops on the way up north!",5 star rating,Kevin L.
2/14/2016,"Phoenix, AZ","Let me just say first, I was a server for 7 years, so I know what service is supposed to be like, and that's how I know this place is utter crap. I also know how restaurants work, so there's no fooling me. So, with that out of the way, the food was good, but only half the order came out...until I asked about the rest of it. The table next to us sat down 15 minutes after us and ordered the same thing as my gf, but their food came out first with my gf's nowhere to be found. I had a carne asada burrito and she had shrimp tacos. There's no reason steak should come out before shrimp. So they obviously forgot and I obviously knew what was up and nicely inquired as to where my gf's food was after waiting 10 minutes after mine came out. I got a ""I'll check on it."" Five minutes pass with no word, so I get up and ask again and the server gave me attitude and said ""do you want it or not?!"" No, I don't want the food I ordered you asshat. I love going into restaurants hungry then ordering food I don't want and complaining when it doesn't come out. How did you know my hobby?! A goddamn clairvoyant you are!  Ok really though, I didn't say that, but I should've. Of course I want the food I ordered for my gf who is sitting there waiting for it and now my food is cold because I'm not gonna eat it in front of her. What an idiotic thing to say. So I keep my cool and refrain from choke slamming him ala the Undertaker and return back to the table assuming it will come out.  5 minutes later it finally did and without a peep from the same waiter who gave me attitude earlier. Aye dios mio! You've got me speaking Spanish I'm so pissed. Jesus Christ, say sorry for making us wait or something. It probably wouldn't of even come out if I didn't ask. Food was good, service was utter crap. Get your act together guys. Many restaurants are busy, so you don't get a get out of jail free card. Because you're busy you should be a well oiled machine, but trying to get any kind of service is more like trying to tackle a well oiled pig instead. I'd rather eat a goddamn quesalupa than deal with this terrible service. A quesalupa for Christ's sake!",1 star rating,Brent G.

WOW - 6 options, all delicious I'm sure. The halibut was so fresh - melt in your mouth amazing.

7/18/2017,"Bellflower, CA","Came here with the lady on a week day and it was still pretty crowded (lunch time). There were people of all types inside eating. The decor was nice nothing too fancy. Pretty small inside of there and you can only sit at a table once you order, not before. Let's get to the food and service. To start, they have a wonderful menu with a lot of variety, from their food down to their salsa bar (unlimited). They have about 8 different types of salsa ranging from non-spicy to very spicy. Wonderful selection of salsa's and all of them were fantastic. I got an asada burrito and a chile relleno, the lady got a carne asada plate with rice and beans.All three dishes were a 10/10Service our first time there was 9/10. The second time we came here our service dropped to around a 6/10 (and it was less packed than the first time).Salsa's were 10/10.Margaritas were 6/10.Price is $$ out of $$$$.Overall this is our favorite restaurant to eat at just because of their flavorful food and it isn't like your everyday Mexican spot where all of the food is dripping with grease. We have yet to try something from here we do not like. We highly recommend trying this if you're in the area!",5 star rating,Justin W.
6/1/2015,"Silver Spring, MD","Love the food here! When I first walked in through through the door, I wasn't very impressed. The place felt too warm, the room was filled with smoke from the kitchen, and the line to order was long. I was tempted to just go to another place but it was almost 2pm and I was hungry! You have to order your food first before sitting down. After ordering your food, they give you a number that you place on your table. Once you sit down they'll bring over some chips for you. There is a salsa bar that has about 7 different salsas with various spice levels. I sat down in a different room apart from the main room which wasn't as stuffy or smokey. The chips were fresh and delicious. And every salsa I had was amazing (I tried them all except for the hot one). I ordered the Tampiquena. The steak was very tender with an amazing flavor. The taquito was nice and crunchy with the filling cooked perfectly. The corn tortilla was okay - I've had better homemade corn tortilla. I also wasn't a big fan of the chicken enchilada with red sauce. There wasn't anything wrong with it. The other food was just so much better it didn't leave much of an impression on me.The portions size here are huge. So I would suggest splitting a meal or be prepare to enter a very happy food coma afterwards.I would recommend this place if you are looking for a casual Mexican place with great food.",4 star rating,Mary H.

Turns out...that wasn't the greatest optionSINCE then, I've become a Los Agaves fan! It is my go to restaurant in SB. Those fantastic Agaves Enchiladas with that sumptuous mango salsa makes it soooo good, with enchiladas of shrimp and halibut!!They definitely do their seafood well here, and its kinda their focus.Then again the do have some great land creatures!Chicken in Poblano Mole: I'm a sucker for mole sauce, and this isn't the godliest of moles but its pretty damn good. The chicken is cooked well and stays juicy. This dish is pretty hearty, but its a good option on a colder day.Looking for a cheaper dish? Get the Chile Poblano Campestre, which is just a chile relleno filled with your choice of meat (pick steak!), and its a HUGE chile that will fill your tummy for only $7Either way, dig through their menu and specials too. I've had their lengua tacos which were pretty good too, though a little meager on the meat.Don't forget to try the array of salsas which are all great, and dump some of that habanero salsa on everything!!

What happened to thanks dad for paying for the electricity so I can read at night. How about thanks dad for paying the mortgage so I have a roof over my head. Nope. Us guys always get the raw deal. I'm not a dad but I'm echoing what I heard from Chris Rock, ahahahha""I'm a feminine, I stand for women's right. But I want my guy to pay for the mortgage, my car, and $1000 allowance"" ""Huh?"" I love getting out of LA. For one thing, I can't stand LA traffic, the people, and its dreadful economy. Yeah I'm bitching! We ordered a Mojectie sea and earth, seafood and beef. It's a soupy dish with fragrant veggies like onion, bell pepper, and green onion. I like that  they have open salsa bar, self serve drinks, and fast service. I wish they have fresh chopped onion, and cilantro but no big deal.What's not like? This is the go to place for tourists and SB residents alike. I wish I can try there other food as well. Recaps:Food- a-ok. It didn't make me go wow or anythingService- if you're a hot chick you'll get lots of attention here.Ambiance - Traditional Mexico decor with earthy tones of orange wall, past harvesting pictures, donkey pictures, rice seeds on the wall.If you're in SB and wanted Mexican food this is your first stop.""Thanks Dad for picking me up so I don't have to walk home.""",3 star rating,Joe C.

4/3/2014,"Brooklyn, NY","Please do not eat here unless you would like to projectile vomit on your boyfriend. Food was bland and mediocre and on top of everything, the service was bad. I got food poisoning after eating the agaves burrito which has fish and shrimp in it. No flavor on seafood and possibly the fish wasn't cooked.

8/4/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Went to Los Agaves at Milpas last night with my husband and we were very disappointed. Our last visits there have been disappointing and we go at least once a week.We ordered Griga ao Pastor, paid for it, grabbed our number and set down to wait for the food. Few minutes later the guy who took our order came to our table saying they didn't have Griga ao pastor anymore and we could order Gringa with steak or chicken. My husband chose steak. I asked for a menu and ordered a shrimp quesadilla which is what I usually order. My husband's food arrived way before mine and I told him to start eating otherwise his food would get cold. I was hoping to eat some chips while waiting for my food but the chips only came when he was done and I was half way through my plate. The table next to us asked for chips 4 times and nobody brought their chips. My shrimp quesadilla was completely different than usual, had a spicy sauce in it, not great.We are very disappointed because we used to love Los Agaves but I guess it's time to eat Mexican food else where.",2 star rating,Rachel P.

Salsa bar is great.  Definitely recommend.  Place gets busy early for lunch.  Service is good.",4 star rating,Bill M.
10/25/2012,"Sunnyvale, CA",I thoroughly enjoyed eating here. The quality of Mexican food is at its highest in a casual atmosphere. You can taste the quality of their food and beverages down to the simplest things like their rice and horchata. It's the best I've ever had! They also have wonderful customer service. I was holding my box of food amidst the busy restaurant and one of the owners took the time to notice and get an bag for me without me having to ask. I'm from Northern California and I will eat here every time I'm down in the area. They totally deserve five stars,5 star rating,iyra t.
3/12/2014,"San Francisco, CA","Two of us went for dinner.  The line was long, but we had checked the Yelp reviews prior so this was not a surprise.  Parking in the area was a pain, and it did take awhile since there were many other cars circling and looking for spots.  After you order, you seat yourself.  This is also a little stressful since there's not always an open table, leaving you awkwardly loitering and trying to gauge how far along people are in their meals.  There were a few employees that were trying to help people find tables.  Some people forgot their manners and were sniping open tables before people who had been waiting for far longer.  Now, the food: we both ordered the molcajetes and had no idea what we were about to get into.  It was good though, the portion was huge.  I found a couple salsas at the salsa bar that I liked.",4 star rating,Amber M.
4/22/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Beautifully presented food that unfortunately lacks flavor. The core menu items of enchiladas, tacos, sopas, and beans and rice have all been disappointing. Horchata is on the menu but has been sold out both times I've been to this location. It would be nice to see some dessert offerings in addition to flan (sometimes you want something sweet, but risking the eggy potential of badly-prepared flan doesn't make it a compelling choice). Some of the special and entree dishes should come with soft tortillas to help soak up extra sauce but don't. Like others, I experienced painful digestive issues after eating here and won't be coming back again.Crowds make navigating the interior space of the restaurant a pain and table service after you've ordered is pretty much non-existant (you just can't get tortilla chips, silverware, or napkins). Part of the issue is that waitstaff at this location don't seem to have any standard uniform or name tags and are hard to identify.The physical space itself has issues the management really should address:(1) The main entry for the restaurant needs to be clearly identified. The door on the corner above which the restaurant name is painted isn't it. This confuses lots of people who wander in, stop awkwardly when things don't seem right, and then turn around and leave to sort things out outside. It can't be pleasant for the people who sit by this door that's not a door either. Putting up some good directional signage and keeping the door closed would fix this.(2) The bigger issue is that the door that's not a door has very odd and downright dangerous paving. It's nicely done, but the angles are so wonky that no one can stand/walk there and feel like she's got her footing. Someday someone will trip and be hurt badly here.(3) Is the restaurant accessible for people in wheelchairs or with other significant mobility issues? To parents with kids in strollers? It doesn't look like it. There's the wonky entrance that's not an entrance and then stairs just inside the real entrance. Are disabled people supposed to enter through the sketchy, barred kitchen-ish door in back in the parking lot? It looks like it and, if so, that's downright sad.Another reviewer really hit it spot on -- this place is overhyped. Don't be fooled by the reviews (the sheer number or the high overall rating). This is absolutely not a place for a romantic dinner, for a leisurely meal with friends, or to bring out-of-town guests. If you can tolerate crowds and tight interior spaces, La Super-Rica just a few doors down is better for taste and price.",2 star rating,Minna C.
11/16/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is the BEST MEXICAN FOOD in Santa Barbara, and one of the best Mexican Food restaurants in the world.

My girlfriend and I stopped here for lunch while on weekend trip from the LA area on 9/14 and after a stop at the wharf we were looking for some good Mexican food and fellow Yelpers did not do me wrong. In fact I thought no way this place can be THAT good. Let me tell you, It IS that good.I ordered the Carne Azteca plate and she got this Cochinita Pibil. My plate came with cactus, a cheese stuffed chile, small piece of chorizo sausage, a thin cut steak, tortillas, rice and beans. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and was super tender. Everything was full of flavor and so well done. It was like we were eating at relative's house that spent all day making everything from scratch.Horchata and Jamaica were homemade - not from a fountain! 100 times better.Salsa is great, but medium is really hot in my opinion.Her slow cooked pork was amazing - never seen cochinita pibil at a mexican restaurant before. I've only seen it home cooked.Bottom line this is the best Mexican food I have had in a restaurant setting in my entire life. I don't think you can compete with this place. I doubt many high dollar place could compete either. It was so good we came back on our way back Sunday for burritos - again, amazing.Probably the only bad things are that 1, parking can be a pain. 2, we live so far away from this restaurant.Well done Los Agaves",5 star rating,Tim H.

We went on a Thursday night and the kitchen was pumping! Even with a packed restaurant with a line almost out the door, we were able to find a great place to sit, and our food came in less than 10 minutes. The decor is very beautifully authentic-feeling, with separate ""rooms"" to sit in, and the salsa bar is great. Easily one of my favorite restaurants. Kudos!",5 star rating,Ryan H.

Did I mention the food was good?",5 star rating,Scott R.
4/16/2012,"Calabasas, CA","Stumbled upon Los Agaves on the way to the SB Bowl.  The place had a line out the door at 5:30pm, and many people were waiting for their dishes to come out and had no place to sit.  We opted for take-out for this reason.  I ordered the molcajete with chicken, and my friend ordered mahi-mahi with chimichurri sauce.  About 10 min later, we squeezed out the front door, noticing that the line had grown longer.  Well, there's a reason this place gets mobbed - it's excellent authentic Mexican food.  The molcajete was a new dish to me (and one I wouldn't order again, even though it was very good).  My friend absolutely loved the fish dish, and we vowed to come back if we go to another show at the Bowl.  Their chips and salsas were also very tasty.  Don't miss the handmade corn tortillas - thick, fluffy, and flavorful.",5 star rating,Amelia S.
4/15/2012,"San Jose, CA",Driving through SB and HUNGRY for Mexican food. We ate here based on Yelp reviews and were very pleased. Crowded on a Tues night but the service was friendly and fast. The Chile Nortenos and Agave Enchiladas were both muy delicioso!,4 star rating,Melissa R.
1/18/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","Pretty freakin' delish food!!! So glad that La Super Rica was closed so that we could have the chance to try this place. I actually liked it a little more than Super Rica.We went tonight at about 5.30 and got a table right away (for 4). We came in at the perfect time, because right after we got our table, it got really busy! We did not have to wait in line to order, which was nice.Hubby and I got the Mojado Burrito (mine with steak, his was chicken), our friends got the Fajita Burrito and a Steak Taco with rice. Salsa bar was a hit and miss, I had some Mild Salsa which was just right for my taste buds, my husband got the Habanero and the Avocado salsas, he said they were watery. The servings are pretty big, so either eat a small lunch or be prepared to take it home.  My burrito was pretty good, lots of meat! The rice is tasty, I wish it came with beans on the side too. Service is fast, and as soon as we walked in, several servers asked us if we needed a table and offered their help. But, they didn't bug us during our meal. Good stuff.Since it's just down the street from us, we will be back for sure.",4 star rating,Astrid S.
10/22/2011,"Burbank, CA","My husband and I often visit Santa Barbara for day trips and we were getting bored with the State Street scene so I yelped Mexican food and found Los Agaves. I was a little surprised at how far from the main part of town this place was but when we arrived (on a Sunday  night) there was a line OUT THE DOOR! I was intrigued so we tried it. Customers are asked to stand in line and order at the register much like a fast food joint, i tried to grab a seat while my husband was in line but was politely asked to wait until I had ordered to reserve a table. After ordering you are  given a number asked to find a seat and the food is brought out to your table. The restaurant is decorated much like an El Torito or Acapulcos with hints of Santa Barbara mission history. The food is authentic Mexican and I would liken it to the aforementioned restaurants. There is an all-you-can-serve freshly made salsa bar which is FANTASTIC. The food was hot, the beers were cold and the service was friendly. $30 = dinner and drinks for 2.Recommended.",4 star rating,Karina S.

You get to choose from extra spicy, spicy, medium spicy, etc.I've tried the Chicken Fajita Burrito and the steaming hot Fajita Del Mar. All entrees/ burrito comes in a pretty big portion with a side of rice, and chips. I mean for 10 bucks or so for ONE order, I basically have 2-3 delicious meals set for the rest of the day. Pretty big portions, but most importantly, great quality. :)Possibly the BEST MEXICAN FOOD in Santa Barbara thus far.",5 star rating,Ada C.

1/10/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","This restaurant is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant as well as one of my top casual restaurants period! Excellent, fresh food. Never greasy, interesting and inventive menu options as well as the basics. Good prices for the generous portions served. This is a restaurant where you order at the counter, pay first, and are seated with a number for service. i love this format for a quick or even leisurely lunch or dinner. No waiting and waiting for the check. My favorite dishes are  Chile Rellenos Norteno (roasted-not fried-poblano chiles filled with incredible creamy sauce and grilled shrimp atop fresh handmade tortillas accompanied by a pyramid of rice and a delicious and unique green salad with housemade sweet dressing); quesadilla de flores de calabasa ( quesadillas filled with tempura fried zucchini flowers, cabbage, salsa...delicious!)Anyway, I could go on and on about the menu which is perfectly balanced, always has numerous things to crave and is executed with perfection; great chips, a multitude of salsas and lastly but most important an AMAZING, efficient, friendly staff....the owners are always working their restaurant with impeccable grace and elegance. AWESOME in every way.",5 star rating,J P.

8/26/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Hit or miss? I've only been here twice and the food's been on opposite ends of the spectrum. The first time I was very impressed and was looking forward to coming again. My boyfriend and I had the gringas al pastor and the agaves enchilada. The plating was beautiful, everything was fresh, flavors were there, and it all tasted so good! Definitely 5 stars. The second time I was embarrassed to have taken my friend here especially after her long drive to visit me! It all looked very lackluster. The greens in the ceviche tostada looked sad. The enchilda suizas I am sure they reheated an old plate!! The ceviche may have had the texture of rubber, but the cheese that was 'melted' on the plate looked like rubber. And it didn't look so appealing on top of the green sauce that looked like old pea soup. The enchilada tortilla itself was dry. The plating was not good, it looked messy and dirty. I can tell you that I eat with my eyes first and this just wasn't cutting it. Oh and the chips weren't that good either this time. Not as light and crispy.That said. The service however was very attentive. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. But after looking at all the yelp photos I thought we couldn't go wrong with anything. We were wrong. it also wasn't super busy so I don't know what the excuse is.I will try coming back again, but I don't eat out very often. Some consistency please!",2 star rating,Lillian M.

5/4/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","As far as Mexican places in Santa Barbara go, this is one of the best, if not THE best.  It is NOT the most vegan-friendly place, but what they lack in options, they make up for in flavor and an extensive salsa bar.  The rice and refried beans are not even vegetarian-friendly so if you are veg, your only option really (other than salad, and honestly - who goes to a mexican restaurant for salad?) is the garden burrito with whole beans (no cheese no sour cream for vegan) sub salad for rice.  I clearly have my order down.  Can you tell I've eaten here a lot?  The grilled veggies are delicious and you better come hungry and prepared for a food baby afterwards because it's a LARGE burrito.  I recommend trying everything in the salsa bar but the avocado one is my absolute favorite.  Not a full service restaurant but they are generally pretty quick to bring you a fresh basket of chips.",4 star rating,Katrina M.

They tasted like they were sitting out on the counter for a few days.One of the ladies in our table ordered the shrimp enchiladas that were drenched in their chipotle sauce...

The manager went around every single table THREE times asking how their food was and if they needed anything,meanwhile, i was ignored on every occasion. I felt that i was discriminated.

I had some enchiladas, which were not spectacular.  The salsa bar was very good, plenty of choices and fresh.

11/14/2013,"Beaverton, OR","After all the great reviews and reading Julia Child liked this place, we had to try it the one night we were in town.  I wish we hadn't.  The fact there were no Hispanic people dining there though the restaurant was in a Hispanic area should have been a red flag, but we went in anyway.I ordered the enchiladas suizas special and it was disappointing.  The chicken inside was roasted - not the moist, shredded chicken I'm used to - with no sauce or anything.  It was really dry.  The suiza sauce was a bit spicy for my taste but maybe that's the traditional way...?  I've ordered enchiladas suizas at several other restaurants and they've always been mild.  Not sure which is more authentic.  The enchiladas were topped with two slices of Swiss cheese which just seemed odd, and the beans and rice were nothing to write home about - pretty average.  My husband ordered a chile verde burrito, which wasn't on the menu but they were nice enough to make it.  The chile verde was also really spicy, which, again, we're not used to - it's mild pretty much everywhere else we've ordered it.  The side of guacamole we started with was also spicy - it didn't bother me, but my hubby wasn't a fan.  Maybe spicy is just their thing...?All-in-all this place seemed over-hyped; I'm sure there are better Mexican restaurants in the SB area.  I won't be back.",2 star rating,Andrea W.

Excellent food, decent prices, great service, etc. It's often crowded, which can make things a little hectic because you order at the front and seat yourself, but the staff is often very helpful with helping you snag an available seat. And really, a busy restaurant is rarely a bad thing.  As for the food... everything I've had is great. The cevice is very refreshing and filling; the Agaves enchiladas are great; and the mole enchiladas are very good (on the richer side of things). The mango dressing they use on the side salads is so tasty! Really, nothing but good things to say about the quality of the food.",5 star rating,Lauren S.
12/17/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA",We love coming here although it is often crowded because many others share our opinion of the place! The food is excellent and the portions are huge.  The guys behind the counter are very willing to explain the menu items to you and give great suggestions when asked. We even have friends who drive up from LA just to come here for a meal!,5 star rating,Cary Z.
6/19/2016,"Pleasanton, CA",Went there when visiting my daughter at UCSB. This is a very busy restaurant. The people at the counter and the servers are attentive and welcoming. The food was served piping hot. We had Steak Picado which cooked well. The kids enjoyed it. Wife had the nachos. They came and asked if we wanted it as an appetizer or entree. We wanted the latter. The portions are really large. Wife had the Jamaica drink. She liked it. Overall a very good dining experience. Will definitely be back.,4 star rating,Somnath M.

9/4/2016,"Chino Hills, CA",My daughter and I came here yesterday with some friends and ordered the mole enchilladas and agave enchilladas. The agave enchilladas is the bomb! My daughter doesn't normally eat Mexican food but when she tried the spanish rice she said it was really good! The chips and salsa that came in free were really good as well....The service was also superb- one of the owners even cleaned our table and he is cutie! LOL,5 star rating,Esmie C.

12/12/2016,"San Diego, CA","The food was amazing! Passing through Santa Barbara, we decided to stop for lunch. Off the beaten path where most restaurants reside, we were enticed by the volume of Yelp reviews - and we were not disappointed. The service was quick and the dining area was kept clean. The salsa bar is fantastic, and our food was prepared to perfection. The servings were generous, and the side dishes at most Mexican restaurants are a mediocre after-thought, but not this time. The rice was excellent and the salad was fresh and a pleasant surprise. Parking was limited, as anywhere in Santa Barbara, but at least they had a parking lot -which is more than some places can offer. My only complaint is that I won't be passing through Santa Barbara again anytime soon enough to dine here again!",5 star rating,J M.

6/11/2014,"San Diego, CA",The food was really good and fresh! Not too expensive either for what you get. The grilled shrimp were huge and the shredded chicken enchilada with green sauce was my favorite! I would recommend this place. The only thing I don't like about these types of restaurants is paying and tipping before you even sit down and get your food. I would prefer to tip after we have eaten and get the entire experience.,5 star rating,Grant V.

Huge portions and you can take advantage of the salsa bar!",5 star rating,Lauren H.
8/23/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","Pros: good food, some of the dishes are pretty innovative. I wonder if they make the mole from scratch. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to mexican food, because I make it myself. I was impressed by their spread, and the salsas were pretty damn good. Cons: I made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday night. There's usually a long line to order food, which is not uncommon for this area and not so bad really, unfortunately, they don't have a lot of seating. So if you order your food, you're required to find your own table, once again, not so bad, unless there's no seating at all. Then you have to stand around waiting for a table to open up. If people linger at their tables conversing after finishing their meal then it just gets awkward. If the waiter brings you your food and you still don't have a table, then you're just up the creek. A table finally opened up, after we got our food though. Summary: Good food, but due to their seating is not worth a repeat visit.",2 star rating,Paula R.

6/24/2009,"Santa Barbara, CA","Just as I was beginning to consider a positive re-review my last visit was super lame, and now I shall never return and tell all who ask why that place sucks! The food, still good, but not great and over priced.  The staff- lost my love!  I ordered take out,  I waited, sat, waited longer, sat etc.  About 20 min of that, in a 60% full dining room, still no food.  I asked, got some smart ass response about how he thought he was waiting for a call in order, I was sitting in a chair about 5 feet away obviously waiting for something.  Half my order was sitting, getting cold.  The other half, the cashier had not rung in because he was watching the rest of the dining room instead of listing to my freeking order, so more waiting.  Then when my second half of the order was finished (45 min. later)  the guys gave me attitude about my order like somehow it had become my fault for not getting my food.  They accused me of taking the first half of the order out to my car like I was trying to get a second burrito, for free.  Overall, they made me feel like a stupid gringo girl, that was really unprofessional and crappy.Not a great way to make friends at a new business!  Maybe they will hire some more people and work on their customer service, but I will not be back! Don't bother eating there, plenty of other great Mexican food in Santa Barbara, especially on Milpas.  Try Los Arroyos for pricier food and good atmosphere, Super Cucas for burritos or any of the other places up and down Milpas for a better experience.",1 star rating,Holland H.

10/27/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","I discovered this little gem a few years ago and am now addicted. Both the food and the service are impressive. It is counter service but the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. They are also very good about picking up dirty dishes and bringing by anything you need. As for the food it has always been wonderfully delicious. I have tried several menu items (camarones al la diabla, chicken taquitos, enchiladas, guacamole, agaves burrito, sea bass, and salmon) and they all have been hot, fresh, and excellently prepared. It should be noted this is not entirely traditional mexican cuisine, rather a modern interpretation on classics. So for some if it isn't an exact replica it might be reviewed poorly. However as a Mexican (among other ethnicities) I am impressed with the attention to the tradition and equally satisfied by the creativity of the dishes. Keep up the good work.",5 star rating,Chelle Y.

9/29/2013,"Goleta, CA","Los Agaves is my favorite Mexican food in Santa Barbara.The salsa bar is the best I have seen, with tons of delicious salsas including an impressively spicy habanero salsa, along with unlimited chips of course. The seafood enchiladas are to die for. They come with a fruity salad that is shockingly flavorful (coming from someone who usually doesn't care for salad much), great rice, and enchiladas filled with tender seafood and topped with a rich creamy sauce. The chicken mole is also amazing. If you are feeling particularly hungry, try the queso fundito. It is basically cheese melted with chorizo and peppers, served with homemade tortillas. It's definitely not for those looking to eat healthy but it is delectable.This place can get busy but the service stays pretty good regardless. The restaurant is well furnished and feels like a nice place to enjoy a meal. The dishes can get a bit pricy, but you definitely get what you pay for.",5 star rating,Matt S.

7/8/2016,"San Diego, CA","Not what it used to be. The food used to be a better quality but now it just tastes like it's mass produced. That was my favorite part of this restaurant, the food tasted like it had been made by a Mexican grandmother. It doesn't taste healthy or fresh like it used to. The salsa bar is still good, but my usual dish and other food items are not as good. I guess you get what you pay for, still pretty inexpensive and a lot of food per dish. I have noticed that prices have slightly gone up since their initial years. The level of customer service has also gone down. I have been to the Milpas, De La Vina, and Camino Real locations and no one smiles or greets you. This is important for me as a customer and what keeps me away. I understand there are good and bad days but I guess the days I eat here are all bad days. My parents still like coming here and sometimes when I visit them, we will settle for Los Agaves as it is a fairly safe, inexpensive choice.",3 star rating,Miss M.

9/12/2011,"Mount Pleasant, Charleston, SC","This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara, if you take price, quality, portion size and ambiance into consideration. I think they are slipping - badly.  I loved their seafood burrito and enchilada, both of which used to have very generous portions of shrimp and halibut. I got in a rut and ordered them every single time. The last 3 times there was very little halibut in them - once NONE whatsoever - just a few shrimp. I thought it was a fluke and told the owner, so he could re-train the staff person who made it. He very nicely offered to bring me a piece of fish, which I refused, since I was finished at that point. Ordered it again last week - if there was any halibut in it, I couldn't find it - just 4-5 shrimp. I won't be ordering it again - $12 is a lot for a shrimp burrito which is mostly a big white tortilla. The salmon-colored sauce they put on the burrito is fabulous, and I really like the refreshing change of serving a mixed green salad with mango, oranges, & cranberries alongside the entree. I do wish they'd correct the menu which say everything comes with beans and rice, (""or"" rice?)  - whatever, it is confusing and the order- takers are clearly impatient explaining it over and over to customers. Put a sticker over it or something!  Their guacamole is excellent and fairly priced - only $4.95 for a large serving. Ours had two many unripe chunks in it this last visit. (Again - more training required for the kitchen - if the avo's aren't ripe - ""86"" it!)  Complimentary salsas and chips are excellent.Other ""irritants"": customers routinely walk in and put a cell phone on a table when they walk in (to hold it) when is a line of people waiting ahead of them. How about letting go of the ""it's all about ME!"" attitude, be polite, and wait til you've ordered? The staff should enforce this, as they do get pushy about seating at times, so I know they aren't afraid to push customers around.I appreciate the heavy rustic wooden furniture, colorful art and brightly painted walls, and the fact that they opened up another room for additional seating. (Wish they could do something about the acoustics, however - it can be deafening.) I hope this place gets back to it's very high standards and returns to the gem it used to be!",4 star rating,Nancy R.
2/12/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Everything was perfect, and I truly can't wait to come here again!I ordered the fajita burrito combo and a Corona. The total came out to be around 14 dollars, which I think is very reasonable.The Fajitas burrito was made to perfection. The steak was tenderly cooked, and the oozing flavors had a profound effect on my taste buds.  Aside from burrito the meal also came with rice, sour cream and guacamole. And of course the Corona was a perfect complement to the whole meal.I especially enjoyed the salsa bar and tortilla chips. The batch of tortilla chips they gave us were hot and fresh! The Chips felt like they came straight out of the oven! It was of the best and freshest chips I have ever had. Aside from the quality of food, the quality of the service also stood out. The Manager/Owner would survey the floor and ask everyone in the restaurant how the food was. The couple next to us replied to ""Todos Excelente!""

Los Agavas also has a salasa bar with habanero, avocado salsas and to my surprise was stocked with fresh nopales. My only problem with the place is the waiters/waitresses. There doesn't seem to be a lot of organization in the dining area and I realized that they had forgotten to bring me an extra sour cream that I ordered.

8/21/2010,"Bronx, NY","The best thing about Los Agaves is the salsa bar, probably my favorite in Santa Barbara.  They have five or six, including a quemada which is excellent and one flavored with avocado which is also very good.  The others (habanero, chipotle, chip salsa) are above average, and the bar had pickled cactus, jalapenos, and some kind of bean mix.  I wish it had fresh onion and cilantro as well.  Chips are free.The services is also good and the dining room is pleasant.The food here is the real issue for me.  Some of the sauces they use are very good but everything I've had here is a little bland -- the type of place I might want to go to if my stomach was a little off but I was craving Mexican food. To be fair, I should note that my partner, who has been with me the three times I have been here, is critiquing my critique as I type -- she usually tries to steer us here on Saturday mornings while I try to steer us to Lito's or Alta Mirano.  Even she admits that the heuvos rancheros came with a paltry serving of meat (albeit a flavorful one).  She also had to send it back once because she wanted the eggs over easy, and they weren't.  They were very nice about this and the eggs were fine the second time around.  She would give them three stars, if not four.",2 star rating,gonjobi j.
1/17/2014,"Oxnard, CA","Overall the restaurant was an awesome find. The salsa and chips were delicious. I ordered the ""Tacos del Mar"" with halibut. It didn't take long for the food to arrive and it look very good. I took one bite of the taco and was surprised. There was no overpowering fish taste but there was really no taste to the taco. There was sauce under the fish that had plenty of flavor when I tried it alone, but I don't think there was enough for the whole taco. The rice on the other hand was amazing, it had the perfect amount of saltiness. The best part of the meal was the salad. Everything about the salad was perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant as I'm sure it was a fluke about the fish. Last thing, I don't recommend sitting by the window facing the main road during sunset, it can get pretty hot.",4 star rating,Graciano L.

4/19/2013,"Oxnard, CA","Came here based on impressive yelp reviews on a Thursday night & this place was hoppin'!  We had called ahead to ask if would be easy to seat a party of 8 soon & phone person said yes.   Difficult parking options were a bad sign, though.  The aesthetics were cool but space inside appeared limited with the volume of people here.  It's Counter Service here & the long line crawls right beside tables with customers trying to enjoy their food.  Cramped conditions are not a great place for my energetic kids to be waiting in line.  Had to apologize a few times :(  Although the phone person said finding a table would be easy, with the crowds present @ the time, I was stressing about whether I could find seating for my party of 8.  A few of my party were new to the country & never had Mexican food before.  Didn't want to end up at different tables while eating.  After 10 minutes in line, we left, for fear of having food but no place to enjoy it together.  Ended up having a wonderful experience @ El Paseo Restaurant.  Food looks good but this place is probably better for small groups & non-energetic kids if you're interested in eating there.  We'll plan for takeout if we have a chance to come back.  ""Hakuna matata"" my kids said as we left.",2 star rating,Dave A.

1/14/2012,"Paso Robles, CA","Pros - Fresh corn tortillas, Original creative menu. Great staff. For large groups they will take your order from the table. If you are passionate about your food you will be satisfied. Cons - I & my brother in law found the food (Verde Burrito & The Poblano Compreste) poblano to be hotter than I expected (and I do like things hot).  But fresh chiles can vary in hotness when I do my own mexican cooking. The Guacamole had an overripe one in the batch (bummer).  I would go back there if I am in the area. I am rooting for this place and expect a better experience next time.",4 star rating,Scott K.

6/8/2011,"Irvine, CA","Amazing!!!Cheap food.  Got a huge garden burrito and big pile of rice with pico, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  Full off only half the burrito.Also, complimentary chips to accompany the huge salsa bar (about 10 salsas).Only con for me (but I know others might love) is that they pack the burritos (and especially the chile relleno/pablano) with cheese.  For me, it was so much that I had to pull some of it out.  However, if you like cheese, you'll love this.Pretty good beer selection too.  Get here around 7pm to miss the lines because apparently, the line travels out the door throughout the day.  It's just that damn great!!!Try to park on the street.  The restaurant is pretty big, but their private lot only has about 10 spaces.",5 star rating,Burrel V.
8/6/2014,"Beaumont, CA","Well this place is amazing!!  The best Mexican food I've had and trust me I've had my share of Mexican food.  I walked to this place from downtown SB and it was well worth it. I had the enchiladas (beef, chicken, and cheese) with three different sauces. The salsa selection was great, some were very spicy so beware. Not sure why some reviews complained about service, you walk up and order your food and five inured later they bring it to your table. Service was just fine but even it had been horrible the food would have been well worth the visit. If ever in SB, this is a must visit!!!",5 star rating,Dwyane H.
2/4/2014,"Goleta, CA","We went to Los Agaves with a group of friends for our buddy's birthday lunch. The food was amazing! I had the Chilies Rellenos Burrito which was one of the best burritos I have had in a very long time. Between the group we ordered probably half the menu and everyone loved their food. The customer service was great, everyone was very friendly even though it was super busy. The owner was working the register and mingling with the customer. The salsa bar has a ton of great salsas, a little of everything. I guess the only real down side is that it is very busy and thus very noisy. Oh and parking can be kind of a pain. But regardless I am coming back!",5 star rating,Maggie A.
1/19/2013,"San Francisco, CA","Don't let the line in front of the restaurant turn you away!THE LINEAfter finding out that the boyfriend and I would be making our way down to Santa Barbara, I turned to Yelp for the answer as to where we should eat. Thank you Yelp for not failing me. When we got to the restaurant, we were lucky enough to find parking in that teeny lot in the back of the restaurant. As we turned the corner to walk into the restaurant, we were stopped by a line. BUT it didn't turn us away because after reading all the good reviews on Yelp, I was determined that this knocked off my list of restaurants to try. JUST SO YOU KNOWAfter waiting 20-30 minutes we finally made our way inside the restaurant. How this place works is, you order before you sit, you're given a stand with a number that's associated with your order, then you hunt for a table. Oh, and don't worry, you'll get your tortilla chips. Just be sure to get your own salsa by the soda fountain.HOMEMADE TORTILLASIt didn't take long for the food to arrive at our table, thank goodness because we were both hungry and tired from driving and standing in line. The best thing about this meal were the HOMEMADE tortillas, which are pretty damn good! The beef was tender, not overly but perfectly sautéed. I don't usually compliment restaurants on their rice, but there's always a first time for everything (almost everything), and with that being said the rice was pretty darn tasty (I'm still in shock that I said that =X)! SERVICEThe service was GREAT, all of the employees were super friendly and walked around with smiles on their faces. I'd say this was the best service I've received at a restaurant throughout my trip! CONCLUSIONI left the restaurant happy, as was my stomach. What more can you ask for? So with that being said, I'd definitely recommend anyone making their way down to Santa Barbara to make their way to Los Agaves. Remember, DON'T LET THE LINE TURN YOU AWAY.",4 star rating,Heather C.

7/29/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","We went here wanting Mexican food, since we hadn't had any during our stay in Santa Barbara. We saw this place on yelp and the relatively high rating of 4.5 stars. I have to say, after going here I have no clue what the fuss was about. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The rice and beans seemed kind of reheated or something.... The tortilla chips they give you were pretty good though, crunchy and salty. Hard to recall what we ate, probably because I can't pronounce stuff.My sister got the chicken fajita burrito. It was like eating a little baby it was so big! I had a bite of the chicken and it was pretty tasty (nice char, good seasoning). There were waaay too many peppers though. I got some shredded beef taquito kid of things which were alright. My brother got some shredded beef enchiladas but with out sauces. And I can't recall what my mom got but it was chicken in some kind of a soup with avocado on top? I don't know. It was kind of weird.That was my first time in SB and when I come back I won't be coming to this place.",2 star rating,Victoria R.

I'm coming back just for the rice! Not to mention the beans, the house salad, the nachos, the agave burrito.... The list could go on and on! I have to say a major kudos to them.

The homemade tortillas are excellent, you can't go wrong with anything on the salsa bar, and everything tasted super fresh.Someone, who i believe to be the owner, came up to us during our meal just to make sure all was okay. Un-obtrusive yet totally attentive.

5/3/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","I always thought ""YAMR"" was just a phrase I heard from the British kids leaving the bars at 2am...Until I found out Yet-Another-Mexican-Restaurant entered my lexiconFortunately, Los Agaves breaks out of that unfortunate stereotype in a huge way.Some serious meals can be had here especially if you enjoy Mexican seafood or salad dishes. Across the board, the food is amazing along with the salsa bar. Salsa beats anything in town including Los Arroyos.... The Pico is hot, yet amazing... I'll throw in on anything.Favorites are chicken (really!), various pork, and seafood - haven't had anything that's not worthy of eating way too much.Give this one a shot if you're in the mood for something with a slightly more upscale ambiance than La Super Rica, without the line.",5 star rating,Garrett L.

Ambiance, service and quality. I cant mention too many specifics, but I had some family in town from the east coast and they LOVED it. For folks that dont really have decent Mex where they are from, they got fajitas and were over the moon on how fresh and well seasoned everything was.On a side note, I also liked the location as it took me off the beaten path and gave me some sense of normalcy for an other wise touristy area.

The thing that really made this place amazing was it's wide varied of sauces. All of which were really damn good.

As a Korean, I love it when dishes come to the table sizzling so hot that it singes my tongue. The prices are not cheap, but definitely affordable for the budget conscious consumer who wants delicious mexican without the bells and whistles of live mariachi music, white-frocked waitresses and dark lighting. I will definitely go back again and try a different hot salsa and indulge myself in some more mole.p.s.

If you have a huge party, I suggest the nachos con queso. They come with salsa, onions, and tomatoes. The food is very fresh here. The only issue is that you may have to wait a while for a table. Tuesday's are taco Tuesday, so be sure to come early. If you order vegetarian tacos, make sure you tell them to add frijoles refritos or else you will end up with cheese and veggies in a soft taco - highly unappetizing!

7/9/2010,"Brighton, MA","Driving through Santa Barbara on our way to Solvang, we were in the mood for mexican food.  I yelped fish tacos, and Los Agaves was one of the places that came up with the best reviews.  And it did not disappoint!In addition to helping ourselves to fresh salsa bar, we ordered ""earth and sea"" molcajete, fish tacos and side of black beans.  There was ample food and it was all delicious.  I would definitely go again.  Another win for me was the airy/breezy/fresh environment.  I would love to visit again.",4 star rating,Branka S.

2/17/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA",Heard that this was the best Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara and my boyfriend and I had to pay a visit. I got the crispy chicken taco combo and an horchata. The wait for food wasn't too long. Their rice and beans are presented in a rice pyramid and a little taco shell bowl of refried beans. The ambiance is nicer than most mexican restaurants! 5 Stars,5 star rating,Davyana S.

9/1/2014,"Laguna Hills, CA",Regardless of my following comments I gave this place a 5 because the food was Grade A and the price was reasonable for the servings and great quality. I was very happy with the fish tacos and my wife enjoyed her Mole Poblano. On a side note I *thought* this place was self seating. Since it was packed my wife went to order food and I grabbed a table. I was promptly kicked out of the table to stand in the hall because another party already had a # and I didn't. This does seem a bit fair but it was a little embarassing and uncomfortable.,5 star rating,Joshua S.
2/6/2011,"Yorba Linda, CA","Favorite Mexican place, ever. I heard this restaurant was making other ones around it close down... and for good reason.Love their enchiladas here - whenever I come I order two beef enchiladas with extra rice (instead of beans - though their beans are good) and extra sauce - without even having to think twice. Fajitas here are great. Their burrito mojado is also delicious.Order at the front, then you get a number, go to the side and get your salsa/utensils and find a table to sit down. It can get kind of packed here, so it's better to split and conquer (some stay to order and others find a table). Chips are endless (but delivery can be a little slow, depending on how busy it is) and salsa bar is endless and serve yourself. Negatives are perhaps how busy it gets, and also the parking. There is street parking up and down Milpas, and there's also one TINY private lot behind the building, but navigating in, through, and out of it is a pain. It's not enough to stop us from coming here though!Just thinking about this place makes me drool a little.",5 star rating,Sarah S.

The place is really nice, and the staff is really friendly. My favorite thing about walking into a restaurant is the staff acknowledging you and making you feel like a friend and not just a customer. I really liked that. Anyway, I got the nachos plate loaded with chicken, and that was was one mean plate. My date and I shared that, and we were quite full on it. Pretty awesome food, will definitely come again!",4 star rating,Sara T.
4/19/2015,"Pleasanton, CA","We were a group of eight and overall we had a great experience and lots of great food. The one story I want to relate is about the service we received. There was a hostess at the door when we walked in, but she doesn't seat you, it's not a full-service, be-seated-and-order type of place; you order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Nevertheless we noticed that we were receiving very attentive service once we sat down. The food was served quickly, and multiple staff kept checking to see that everything was ok, which it was, everyone enjoyed their food. I spoke to the hostess just before we left to compliment the service we received; she said that when we walked in it looked like we hadn't been there before so she asked the guys to look after us, which they did really well!",5 star rating,Richard T.

I ask for these tacos all the time even if there not on the special board and there always happy to make them for me with the exception of one time the cashier said that it was not on the specials.

Agave Enchiladas.Also unusually good, but I might consider just a tad more carefully before I drove 100 miles: Chile Nortenos.

9/20/2010,"Santa Monica, CA","3.5 StarsThis was my second visit to Los Agaves. My friends live down the street and it's on the way to the Santa Barbara Bowl.We got there around 5:30 and it was packed. We waited in line for about 10 mins, once you've ordered they have people that start getting your seating set-up. They've got the process down.I ordered the special Seafood Molcajete, other items at our table included the lengua special and the Tampiquena. I prepared for my meal, by getting some salsa from the salsa bar. Some really nice salsas, the avocado sauce and habanero salsa are fantastic. As each plate arrived at our table, there was one thing missing, my meal. Some how they didn't get my order in, so I had to wait...and wait. It seemed like an eternity, but my meal finally came. It was delicious, the fish was grilled and placed on the top with sliced avocado, the clams, mussels and shrimp were in the simmering lava rock bowl. The tomato based broth had a nice spice, it reminded me of a Mexican style cioppino. Dipping the fresh tortillas into the broth with the melting cheese was great and the portion was big.Besides the delay with the meal, everything else was on point.",4 star rating,Peter C.
1/6/2011,"River Forest, IL","Thoroughly enjoyed myself. I ordered the popular molcajete dish with chicken. I honestly didn't know what to expect with regard to ""format"" based on the ambiguous description of the dish. But it was basically chunks of chicken sitting in a yummy soupy tomato sauce/salsa with the avocado and cheese ingredients on top. You scoop the ingredients onto an included corn tortilla and munch away. It was good but I wouldn't say that it blew me away. Also, I thought they could have provided more corn tortillas, as I ran out of them well before I finished the dish.We also ordered Queso Fundito, which was quite good. One of the better ones that I've had! Recommended!One of my companions ordered the Chiles Nortenos poblano dish and commented that it was quite good. I didn't try it, but it certainly looked delicious. Another companion ordered the carnitas (marinated pork) taco daily special, but was a bit disappointed when an attendant came back to our table and let us know that they were out of carnitas. How does that happen? Oh well, she went with carne (steak) instead, and was happy with the substitution.This place is counter service, and seating can certainly be a challenge. It was definitely packed full of customers. We ended up sitting in the front near the windows, which I would probably advise against... between the hot food and the sun, we were a little uncomfortably warm.Overall, a very good experience. Would definitely do again!",4 star rating,Frank L.
12/19/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","This was my second time eating here as I don't live in the city. First time I got tacos, they were very good, but this time I brought my husband and we tried seafood dishes on the menu (the stuffed peppers with shrimp and shrimp and halibut enchiladas). They were exceptional. Everything tasted so fresh and the shrimp in the peppers were huge and bountiful. We loved the side salad -- that mango dressing is unbelievable.  Ambiance is surprisingly nice for a place where you order at the register (they bring your food to the table). Staff were super nice, the owner's mother came out from behind the kitchen to ask how we enjoyed our meal. Salsa bar is great.My hesitancy in writing such a glowing review is that the lines will start forming such as at La Superica (which I also love) down the street.

After several months Los Agaves has become the lynchpin of my weekly routine. All their food is exceptional. It's ""upper crust"" Mexican food, which is to say they take an already delicious cuisine and give a very sophisticated five star treatment; the flavors in every dish are complex and explode with intensity and freshness but are still very reasonably priced. Clearly a lot of thought and culinary expertise was put into each item on their menu - and it shows with every bite.",5 star rating,Michael V.
8/26/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","We took my partner's sister here when she was visiting this past weekend. I've had plenty of delicious mexican food, but this place blew them all out of the water!! I had the burrito mojado with steak (so incredible, I don't even eat sour cream but I was smothering that delicious burrito in salsa, guac, and sour cream-heaaaveeen), my partner had a combo chile relleno (eh), crispy taco (delicious), and soft taco (delicious and stuffed to the brim with chicken), and it also came with the standard rice and beans (the refried beans were definitely high up in my top 5 best beans ever), his sister had the burrito mojado with chicken (also amazing), and I can't remember what her friend got, but she seemed in love with what she had as well.Salsa was incredible. I mixed the mild salsa with the very spicy, because their mild salsa is sooo good but I wanted a little kick. They are NOT kidding when they say ""very spicy"", just so you know!Unfortunately, I was less than pleased with their ""homemade"" horchata-I got some from the bottom of the container before it was refilled, and it tasted weirdly powdery, not like any actual homemade horchata I've ever had before. The service was also not too great-one of the owners came by to ask us if we wanted anything else, but then told us because we had just finished, they needed out table in 10-15 minutes. WHAT? I know you're busy, but I've never asked a table to leave-especially whe they finished their food ~5 minutes ago.However, the food made up for any lack in service.

8/23/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Sally Spork (local SB foodie) reviews Los AgavesAtmosphere: Mexican-ish decor: not flashy, not fancy. Rustic appeal with wooden tables/chairs and colorful art posters/wall decor. There is quite a bit of indoor seating.Service: This is an eatery where you order from the counter, like many Mexican cafes/restaurants, and given a number to place on table. I was with Sam and has an aversion to this setup of ordering: higher end prices but less customer service. I don't have a problem with it. However: the restaurant was packed seating all taken, you do you have to scope out where to sit while staying in line and when a spot opens up quickly grab it (I put my sunglasses/phone book on table) When we went to sit at our 'saved' spot we found someone had put their number on it (and yes my sunglasses/book was right beside it.) Hmm. Food came out quickly, but we only ordered a cold dish. Food/drink: We ordered a beer and verde ceviche. It was so hot that we could barely eat it., too bad as there was plenty of seafood and avocado. In fact we didn't finish it, choosing to take it to go and give it someone we saw on the street. We told a passing server that it was extremely hot and can't finish it she said, ""oh, yeah: three other people told me that."" We said it would be nice if there was some indication of 'heat' by each item (as they do in Thai food), she agreed as that was a common problem. She also went on to say, 'it really depends who is cooking in the kitchen: one chef cooks a more tropical way another with more heat.' Boo on this! She also said, ""just to let you know green sauces are hot, and red ones are more mild."" Again Boo! Is this an insider secret? Consistency and clarity are key for a satisfying experience.Summary: Los Agaves has an interesting menu and I've heard many good thing from Anglos and Latins alike. The place always looks packed, usually a good sign! I'd go back again,  I do know that we will have to be scrutinizing about the dishes ordered in terms of 'heat' every time we order.",3 star rating,Sally Spork S.

1/19/2016,"Alta Loma, CA","This place is fantastic! Stopped here after a long road trip and so glad we did. You order at the register, they give you a number and then you find your own table. It's super crowded because it's really popular so you might want to keep that in mind if you are in a hurry at peak dinner time. Once you find a table they bring you warm chips to enjoy with the salsa. They have a salsa bar with so many choices and every single salsa tasted delicious! The food portions are large and tasted amazing! Wish We lived closer to this place, we would definitely make it our regular spot for incredible Mexican food. Go here if you want delicious food in a casual atmosphere.",5 star rating,G C.

1/4/2014,"Las Vegas, NV","OMG the ratings don't lie. (Sorry such long review, but they deserves detailed review) I love ceviche & guac & it's really hit or miss on whether it's delish or just mediocre. I'd say more often than not, mediocre. But I still get it all the time cuz I hope it'll be more on the delish side. THIS PLACE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT, THERES IS THE BOMB!!! No fishy flavor, good quality fish that didn't have chewy pieces & a really good balance of flavors from the lime juice to the onions & peppers & seasonings. (I can't handle hot & unless I bit into a jalapeño it was not) As for the guacamole, a lot of times places use under or over ripe avos & either I was lucky to get a good batch or this place always serves it ripe. Once again good balance of all the seasonings (also not spicy). So many times I get guac & I feel like it's missing something. The food was so delish I ate it all even though my tummy was hurting from over eating, but I know I won't get it this good for a while!

I am a Los Angeleno native...tacos, burritos, tamales are as ubiquitous as hamburgers...had one..had them all....until today. This is some ridiculously good, fresh food. The rice is so flavorful and the shrimp stuffed relleno was better then any stuffed chili I have ever eaten. The chips were hot, fresh, and light, not a hint of oil(they must bake the chips)... and the salsa...so good but some of them are very, very spicy.. You have to drink water after you try that green one...Loved the dressing on the salad... with the fresh mango's...this is some good food.  the service was friendly, and quick...the restaurant clean and pleasant.

There was a wonderful salad that came on the plate and the flavors were unbelievable. Loved it all EXCEPT the chips that came with salsa were a bit stale, but since they were free no complaints.

To me this place was just like any decent Mexican taqueria in California but its a TAQUERIA period!! Clearly anyone who gives this place 5-stars has not eaten much mexican in California as this was just about average. I would have give it 3 stars but the reason for my 2-star review is for this deep fried empanada like appetizer with Oaxaca cheese and other stuffings that was recommended by the cashier (since it is a self service joint) and it was just super disgusting. I could barely have a bite of it and when I provided my feedback to the cashier that I really didn't like what he recommended, he just shrugged and didn't seem to care one bit.",2 star rating,Binoy G.

Stumbled across this place and was wowed. The food is amazing . I ordered the chile verde burrito which is my go to dish. I'm pretty sure it was the best I ever had. I give it 4 stars only because there's no Margaritas/ Liquor. Beer only. with this food you need a delicious Margarita . The parking and bathroom situations aren't the greatest. Also you stand in line to order your food. Although nowhere near being a taco shop this restaurant felt like it to a degree. If I'm rating the food and service only its a definite 5 stars.

12/30/2011,"Long Beach, CA","Went to Santa Barbara after Christmas to visit long time friends and make new memories....Had ""yelped' and ' Trip Advised' restaurants and found Los Agave's at the top...Was impressed w/ the reviews and will be entirely in your 'debt' forever!!!!.....Decided it would be our first place to eat during our Santa Barbara adventure...It was also so very close to our hotel (we stayed in the East Beach, JUST down from State St. so this was also very convenient.....Had forgotten the 'instructions' of some of the fellow reviewers regarding getting line for to place an order and then getting a seat, but quickly figured it out.....I thought their system was a little odd, and a lot of work for them, but obviously by the amount of people that kept coming in, ordering,  (sometimes taking out)eating, and enjoying, I think Los Agave's  has a system that works just fine....If you are going to be impatient, order wine or a margarita and just be grateful you're going to have a wonderful meal!OMG, the food was sooooooo worth the short wait !!!!! This is absolutely OUTSTANDING Mexican Food !!!!!! Currently it is my FAVORITE Mexican Food !I had the Quesadilla de Flor de Calabeza (had a choice of grilled or fried zucchini flower--chose grilled---YUM)---since I would be ordering the Enchiladas Suizas, I only got one (choice of 1 or 3)...THIS was heaven...so very delicious! and the corn tortilla was thick, chewy and ever so hand made!!! I was on the moon w/ this dish alone! All portions are generous......I have to admit that when my Enchiladas were placed on the table I was initially prepared to be disappointed....The plate was NOT attractive....Two LARGE enchiladas covered w/ a big piece of Swiss Cheese,the pale green Suizas sauce, plus a healthy serving of rice and beans....The beans had a 'reddish' hue, kind of like Lola's in Long Beach (that was a good thing).....But once I tucked into the yummy, cheesy, bite w/ a perfect Suiza sauce, I didn't care what it looked like.....Jim gave me his guacamole, so I had some additional natural 'lipase' (enzyme naturally in avocado that digests fat!).Jim ordered the Tacos del Toros special and was in carnivore heaven....A taco combo of carnitas, sausage and beef....He loved it and would have it again....Pauline (my mother in law) had the Quesadillas w/ steak....came w/ all the usual goodies.....This was a HUGE order, and also totally above average....Jim was pleased that there was a piece left over for him.....Salsa bar was excellent ! LOVED the chipotle, and the habanero was great (in small doses---as it should be!)As to those who gave so so reviews (really? what shape are your taste buds in), OR for those who grumped and complained about the standing in line or waiting to be seated, THANK YOU ! since you won't be back ! Have waited much longer in many other restaurants.....and it's heartening to see a place where the recession obviously does not have any effect on !The staff was polite and helpful.....did not witness anyone being rude.....This is in a mixed neighborhood (old school / new and trendy), across the street is a  Mexican Market, and down the street is a Trader Joes,Los Agaves was filled w/ a combination of locals and tourists.. Quite a blend of  categories of diners---.Trendy ,upscale (locals AND tourists), students, cutting edge of all ages as well as mom and pop.....Heard Italian and  French spoken and British accents....Since this IS Santa Barbara, quite a broad range of tourists, both home grown AND European is normal.....Los Agaves reputation is quite appealing to many....Already planning another Santa Barbara adventure, and will definitely make this one of my 'musts'....Cannot wait to go back....so wish I had something from Los Agaves right now!!!!!so don't forget like I did----------------------------Get in line to order asap...(look up to see the specials, or ask for a menu while in line.Move out of the line and Hold up your number---tell them how many in your partyWait (it will be brief) patiently.Savor the deliciousness of your meal!!!!!",5 star rating,Jim M.

They get you a table the moment you place your order at the counter and service is fast. They serve hot out of the oil tortilla chips.  I ordered the Agaves Enchiladas.

A waitress greeted us and placed a couple of menus on a table said we could sit there as we figure out what to order. Just then more people started coming in. Not more than three minutes after we sat down, a male waiter approached us and asked whether we ordered yet. When we mentioned not yet, he berated us for taking a table without ordering. Mind you, I would have never sat down if it weren't for the waitress, so I thought it was super rude of the staff to have treated us that way.

7/12/2014,"San Diego, CA","The food here is fantastic.  Really.  On a recent trip to SB, we ate at Los Agaves and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the diverse menu.  We had the Agaves Burrito and the Mojado Burrito.  Both had a rich flavor that you can only get in Mexican food that is slow cooked and uses many of the great spices and flavors of Mexican cuisine.  The salsa bar is great as well - they are certainly not afraid of using a variety of chilies, which made for an awesome selection - and the service was excellent as well.  We had eaten at Super-Rica on a previous trip to SB (just up the street from Los Agaves) and it did not even qualify in the same league as Los Agaves, even though it gets a lot of hype.  We liked Los Agaves so much we went back to get some more fantastic food for our drive out of town.  We'll be back.",5 star rating,Neuro T.
11/14/2012,"Buckeye, AZ","Finally got to try this place because the line wasn't out the door. Holy smokin' mole!  Absolutely lives up to the ratings, and then some. After being at a wine bar for longer than necessary I can't remember the dishes we had. It doesn't even matter. They have Mexican food I've never even seen before. Although my wife orders the best meal 99% of the time I think I won this time. But I do remember her plate because I've never seen big chilies filled with shrimp look so amazing. I normally get a taste but she bogarted the whole thing. Every dish being served looked amazing. Let me close with the salsa bar. They have more selection than I've ever witnessed. They have hot, really hot, spicy caliente hot, and then mucho caliente, this is what I'm talking about, HOT!! But flavorful. If this place was in San Diego I'd eat here so much I would look like a stuffed Anaheim Chile.",5 star rating,Les C.

11/19/2012,"Phoenix, AZ","Hands down, the best Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara.  If you go on the weekend, be prepared for a crowded place, but the service is fast and friendly.  The bussers and food runners are extremely observant, always going the extra mile to make sure you have a great experience.  The food is amazing, with perfect quality and great consistency.  My favorite dish is the Agaves Enchiladas.  Be sure to hit up the salsa bar.  Great prices, too!",5 star rating,Lauren L.

Great salsa selection, the chipotle has just enough ""smoke"" to be wonderful.  Good for the kids too.

10/14/2015,"San Francisco, CA","For a Mexican restaraunt that's not mom and pop, this place wins, hands down.  I don't usually eat the Spanish rice, but this was really good.  The pinto beans were to die for.  I also had a chicken sopa and a beef tamale.  Both were great.",4 star rating,elsa z.
3/30/2013,"Pasadena, CA","Crazily Good Food-We've been there three times and each time it gets better.  The shrimp tacos are the best ever, ever.  The huge, crispy shrimp taste like they are battered to order and the slaw that comes on them is unbelieveably good.  That salad with the fresh greens and the fruit, with that amazing dressing is sooo good, also served with very decent rice, shaped in a pyramid and topped with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese- is also way above average.  If they had table service they could charge twice as much, so I'm happy to go to the counter and place my order.  The salsa bar has a great variety of salsas, and the interior of the restaurant is decorated with paintings and fixtures that look like they were custom made in Mexico.  This is no taqueria!",5 star rating,Fan B.
3/26/2013,"Alameda, CA",Delicious Mexican food that isn't pretentious. I had the special halibut burrito and it was tasty and very filling. The chip and salsa are definitely some of the tastiest I've ever had.  Restaurant was crowded - to be expected by the high ratings - so the queue area was tricky to maneuver around to get the salsa and drinks.,4 star rating,Dennis K.
1/3/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","There's a reason this place was voted SB's Best Mexican restaurant of 2012: they consistently deliver great food at great prices with great service. However, who knew they made FANTASTIC TAMALES ?!   I don't know if they are a regular item on the menu but our family was treated to the most delicious bundles of joy, in the most sublime red sauce on Christmas Eve. For all you Tamale aficionados out there, even the ones who are up for hours making gramma's recipe, save yourself some time - order them from Los Agaves. You will get rave reviews since they are cooked to perfection (an ""over the top"" pork, tender chicken and outstanding flavorful vegetarian).  Keep these in mind for the holidays or Super Bowl Sunday ;)P.S. The guac ""rocks"" too!",5 star rating,Carrie C.

4/6/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","Just went here for lunch, it was great! Although it was 2 pm it was pretty busy, but the service was great and handled all of the customers very efficiently. We were greeted at the door by an employee who gave us two menus, showed us the special board, and explained that you order at the counter but then sit wherever you like and they bring you your order.A man in a nice shirt took our order from the counter (owner or manager?) and gave us a number. We got salsas from their salsa bar and sat down. Someone brought us chips instantaneously. The avocado salsa was delicious, my friend tried their ""hot"" salsa which she liked a lot. Our food came out after only about 5-10 minutes. WOW it looked good. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas, and they were delicious. The mole had such deep flavors with just the right amount of spice and hint of cocoa. The chicken was cut into small pieces and was extremely moist. Every bite was a tasty combo of chicken, cheese, tortilla, and mole sauce. The beans and rice were very good too. My friend got enchiladas with shrimp and halibut on the inside, with a chipotle cream sauce on top. I tried a bite and the sauce was pretty spicy but also had a rich depth of flavor. It went very well with the seafood. Hers also came with a little salad that was very different from a salad you would typically expect from a Mexican food restaurant. It was a spring mix with fresh orange slices, crumbled cheese, dried cranberries, and a fantastic mango creamy dressing. The dressing was unlike anything I've tried before - it almost tasted like it had condensed milk in it. While we were eating the nicely dressed man that had taken our order came to check on us, and was so nice and polite. I thanked him for suggesting the mole, and he shared a little bit of the recipe with me. I complimented the restaurant and he was very humble and even complimented some of the other restaurants in the area. Although the restaurant was busy, I saw him take the time to ensure that every guest was happy with their food.This is definitely superior to many other Mexican restaurants in the area because of their delicious sauces, hospitality, and quality of food and dining experience. The food was fresh, there was many options, and I didn't feel ""weighed down after. I have heard it gets very very busy at peak hours but they offer takeout, which I will have to try. 5 stars for sure!",5 star rating,Jean G.

I had the fish tacos and my mom and I shared the ceviche. Tacos were amazing and it was served with a salad with a mango sauce on it, or it had mangos in there somewhere... but it was so good.

1/30/2015,"Red Rock, AZ","We loved our experience at Los Agaves... We went due to the reviews on yelp and took their suggestions, we had a much better experience than the first time we went and since we only live a few blocks away, this is perfect. I had the combo and chose the shredded beef taco which was amazing, the chili relleno also amazing and the chicken enchilada which I could have been just as happy without... I would choose the 2 items combo next time which is plenty for the dinner... we the staff that delivered and served were wonderful and helpful, the person taking the order was not, she did not get it correct on the choice of beans and salad... an honest mistake but we were clear and mentioned to twice what we wanted ( I don't do pinto beans only black) not that it matter as there was too much food anyway, my suggestion would be to have someone taking the order that had a better understanding of the English language as she seemed confused which is why explain what we wanted twice.. The Salsa Bar was delicious and had PERFECT choices.",5 star rating,Faith H.

This spot really is an authentic from scratch  Mexican restaurant with great tasting food.So good I had to introduce myself to the GM and let him know what I do for a living. He lead me in to the kitchen let me know some secrets & preparation techniques. There are NO par-baked , pre- cooked  or frozen fully prepared products used here at Los agaves. There's a chef & full on hands kitchen staff preparing fresh batter, sauces, rice-beans, chips, salsa..etc. I am especially impressed with the marination steps used for there Organic chicken. Most restaurants  including myself at home; will use concentrated orange juice for chicken & skirt steak marinade Not  Los Agave here they use Only fresh whole oranges & lemons squeezed for juice.

10/22/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","The first few times I ate at Los Agaves I thought their Pico De Gallo salsa was great and loved the place.  I have eaten there many times and lately it seems like they are really cheaping out on the  portions. I ordered a Carnitas (neck bones) ""Special"" and it was terrible! I think I paid about $14.00 for a plate of bones. The only meat I could scrape off the bones amounted to about two pinky sized chunks. It was about two small mouthfuls of meat. There was a pale white cooked ear on my plate as well. It looked too small to be a full pigs ear and was totally disgusting!! I fed it to my dog. I stopped ordering their ""Specials"" after that and stuck to the menu. The last Chicken Burrito I bought barely had any meat in it. That was the last straw for me. I'm not going back there again.  I drive by nearly every day and they used to have huge crowds out front but it doesn't seem that way anymore...  You won't see me there!",2 star rating,Destin T.

7/29/2009,"Green Valley, CA","My son and his girlfriend told us about this place.  Great experience.  Not cheap but not high priced either.Decor is good, but nothing special.  You order at the counter, then find a table and they bring your order to you fairly quickly.  Food is good to outstanding based on what you order.  Beware, the portions are large, so you can share many items.  Below is my take on different items we ordered.Carnitas tacos-TWO STARS-The pork was nothing special, just blah.  No onions, or sauce.  Their homemade tortillas, while tasty, were a tad thick with coarse corn.  Carne Asada Tacos-THREE STARS-The beef was tasty, lots of meat, but no condiments and again the thick tortillas.Giant Salad-FOUR STARS-Not strictly Mexican, but very tasty.Molcajete-SIX STARS-This dish is probably the single best Mexican food I have ever had!  Giant stone molcajete, hotter than the hinges of hell, chock full of the good stuff.  Grilled and cut up chicken/beef in a bubbling sauce that you want to eat with a spoon.  Spicy but not too hot. (Tip-Get the beans and rice and spoon the sauce over them-yum!)   A bunch of large shrimp boiled au juice.  A large chunk of delicious fish floating.  A giant pepper and huge green onion along with some slices of fresh avocado poking out of the goodness.  Three people could eat this with a side of rice and beans and a bunch of tortillas.  Fantastico!Beans/Rice-FOUR STARS-Beans were very good and so was the rice.  Not the best I have had, but delicious.Servce-FOUR STARS-You order at the counter as I said.  Place was fairly clean.  A bit loud, but fun atmosphere.",5 star rating,Gene M.

They were out of horchata, so I settled for water.

I settled for the fajita burrito with chicken. They had some great chips and salsa (highly recommend the habanero salsa for the spice lovers out there) and the burrito came shortly after I re-ordered. All-in-all the food was really tasty.

We were expecting some good authentic Mexican food and a great experience from the many good reviews on Yelp, however, we were met with a terrible one. When we entered the restaurant we sat ourselves at two separate tables since they did not have a table for 7 people and a baby. After we looked over the menus and one of us went up to order, a busser came out and told us rudely that we could not sit down on one of the tables until we have ordered. We told him alright and asked where we could wait with the baby while one of us were in line to order. He then said, ""it doesn't matter where you go with your baby. you have to leave."" To top it off, there was a table of 6 next to us and another table of 4 who were Hispanic that he left alone while they were looking at the food menu and haven't ordered. I'm sorry to say this but this restaurant showed racism towards us Asians and to point out the busser/server who is a short dark Hispanic man. I hope to see that man gone if I were to ever come back.",1 star rating,Andrew H.

9/6/2016,"Covina, CA","Came here on Saturday night about 630. There was a line to order. We were right at the front doors. I expected a wait since it was a Saturday night and this place has good reviews. We finally placed our order about 7pm. The food seemed to be coming out slow and we noticed that the waiters were bringing out 1 dish at a time, occasionally 2. At about 740, I asked the waiter about our food. He went in the kitchen and said our ticket was the next one up. We watched as several waiters brought out food to other tables but not ours. Finally about 5 minutes later, he brings out 1 plate, a wet burrito. My son ate half of it and I asked the waiter where the rest of our order was and why did this plate come out by itself? He said that the wet burrito is easy to make so that is why it came out. Don't understand that one. 3 minutes go by and I said, my grandson ordered a crispy taco, how hard is that to make? He said"" I not in control of the food"". I said, you better go find out where his taco is. he went in the kitchen and brought out the taco. 1 minute later he brought out my wifes food and my food. The worst service I've had in years! The food was tasty though. If I come back, I will order it to go.\",2 star rating,Ed B.

They have amazing guacamole and tomatillo sauce, as well as great salsas. I ordered the molcajete and it was solid, but not as good as my favorite spot in Mexico. Yes, I realize I'm comparing the food to actually eating in Mexico, but still, I always have high expectations. The rice was outstanding and the tortillas were nice and thick.

7/24/2013,"Monterey Park, CA","Recently went back with a friend, i have been avoiding this place because in my opinion it is not good.  I grew up in East Los Angeles so i have been around mexican food my whole life.  My grandma use to make mole poblano from scratch, so on one of my past visits i tried theirs.  I was suprised to recieve only a leg and a thigh for an unreasonable amount of money.  Have to say was not too impressed with the flavor of the mole.  On this recent trip i tried the torta cubana which was okay but cubans usually are comprised of shredded pork etc this one had chicken in its place.  It was pretty good nothing to rave about, a run of the mill torta.  But the service in this place is horrible.  When i asked someone for a basket of chips they rudely told ""I'll bring them"".  When our order came, the waitress, with quite a bitchy attitute, got mad at us for the cashier giving us the wrong order number.  My friend ordered the green chili enchilladas which are not even shredded chicken but just dry diced chicken breast placed inside two tortillas then smothered with sauce.  The best part was the two squares of what looked like white american Kraft singles melted on top.  I mean come on buy a cheese grater!  Authentic i say not.  This is probably the most expensive mexican food around and it is not at all worth it.  Thumbs down!",1 star rating,Andrew Z.

10/12/2009,"Encinitas, CA","La Super Rica is worthy of the hype, but when their lines are out the door and starting to turn the corner around the building, one begins to consider alternatives. Hence, Los Agaves, which is all of a half-block away, but this is a neighborhood that can sustain a few taco shops. It's totally nondescript from the street but those stepping through the doors witness one of the more visually striking Mexican restaurants in SB, carefully adorned with agave-shaped chandeliers and paintings of guys hard at work harvesting agaves. You might get all excited about trying the margaritas, but despite the ubiquitous agave references, it's a quick service, order-at-the-counter place a la Rubio's with no tequila on hand. Were they to get a liquor license and hire some waiters, they could easily jack prices up 50% and host their share of romantic dinners. In the meantime, you can still get in on the cheap.Those not frequenting taco shops for the ambiance will be delighted to learn that the food here is damn good. Especially noteworthy is that this is the first place I've been to in the US that features gringas al pastor on the menu, one of mankind's more savory culinary achievements (essentially a quesadilla with pork, but an absurdly tasty rendition). The nachos were equally impressive, with quality toppings like grilled chicken and guacamole found generously applied throughout the entire mound rather than getting a plate full of chips dressed largely with beans. Plus the chips on top were browned at the edges, indicating that the dish may have been completed in an oven rather than in a microwave or under a lamp. We ran out of room to try one of the signature molcajetes, but they're huge and they bubble so you probably can't go wrong there either. So go eat it.",4 star rating,Junk C.

There is simply no other Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara that I crave more than Los Agaves. Favorite dishes are the Agaves Burrito and their fish tacos. The mango vinaigrette served with their salads is so delicious, and it's actually possible to get a meal here that doesn't feel heavy and fattening.

I always seem to get hungry for lunch the minute I hit the Santa Barbara border, so I was happy to find that this place really hits the spot and is a welcome relief from the strains of traffic. The menu might not be super veg-friendly, but the staff is good about helping you customize your order so you can have a meat-free meal. I got a tostada with no meat and they were nice about giving me grilled veggies instead. I love the open salsa bar-- why doesn't every restaurant have this? I had to dock a star because their chips are pretty unimpressive, even though their salsa selection all but makes up for it. Oh, and they place has great customer service: at one point the manager popped out of nowhere to help fix our table that was lopsided... we didn't even have time to ask for help!This place is definitely a step up from  roadtrip food so I'll be sure to stop by the next time I'm passing through.",4 star rating,Eva V.

The waitresses are friendly and very helpful, graceful dancers.

2/2/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is AMAZING. So I thought it was a sit down restaurant and was a little confused when I got there. You wait in line and order your food at the front. Then you can sit anywhere you want and you display your placard on your table. A server will come bring your food and take away the placard. Yes, they serve beer and wine! Always a plus in my book. THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE! I ordered a tostada de ceviche and some nachos thinking that would be enough to fill me. I didn't finish either. They were both MASSIVE. So keep in mind when ordering that everything on the menu is meal size! My boyfriend ordered the enchiladas and the queso fundito and my friend ordered the shrimp burrito. We all tried all of eachother's food. It was all great. It was all so good that it just became all of us eating everything rather than having separate meals ahaha. We had 4 take out boxes of leftovers. We ate it all today before work. It was still super yummy next day. Definitely going back to this little gem. Have not been this pleased with my dining decision since Katsuya! Would recommend to ANYBODY. And I'm from Los Angeles, so my Mexican food standards are fairly high. They make their own tortillas.

The staff is very friendly and busy as the place was crowded. My group of 4 was holding our order number and another group walked in a took a seat before ordering.

We found Los Agaves and are we glad we did!  At first, we were surprised to see that you order at the counter and get a number on a stick like at Carl's Jr. However, the resemblance to any fast food restaurant ended there. Even though the restaurant was packed, the staff was cleaning tables as soon as people left and we found a table immediately. Before we could fill our cups at the serve yourself salsa bar, our food had arrived. We had the house guacamole which was good, but nothing special. My husband had the Agave Enchiladas with seafood and mango. It came with rice and an amazing side salad of spinach, mandarin oranges, dried cranberries and mango. He said it was the best enchilada he had ever had. My son had the Poblano Burrito with steak. It came with rice and a salad with guacamole. He said it was excellent and was only able to eat half. I had the Poblano Chili Companero. I ordered it with chicken, but it came with steak. I was going to send it back, but I tasted it first - good thing, because it was amazing!

When we finally got a table after waiting around for a while, we waited for over 30 minutes for our food- just to figure out they gave us the wrong number. They were nice and apologized but my boyfriend got a tortilla with chicken on it and he didn't get chicken. Good food but they need to figure some stuff out. Ugh!",2 star rating,G B.

Their meats are grilled to perfection and they serve generous portions with classy presentation, fast and affordable. You can't ask for any more.

The food was fresh and delicious and staff were very friendly and hardworking (as opposed to the sloths at Super Rica). I felt better eating at a place that not only looked cleaner but gave a damn about your business. Only bummer was no margaritas (yet called Los Agaves??). Delicious, fresh tortillas and plentiful salsa bar.",4 star rating,ginger f.

11/10/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","I used to eat here all the time because it was close to where I worked. The food is fantastic and you get alot for your money. I always knew that I would eat half for lunch and save the other half for later. Initially, I didn't have a strong opinion of them one way or another. It was just really good Mexican food. However, one day they made a mistake and it actually made me love them more because of they way they handled it. On my lunch break I ordered 2 burritos to-go, paid for them, and then waited to pick up my order. When they handed me just 1 burrito I told them that I paid for 2. They said to wait a moment and would fix the mistake. As I stood there with a to-go bag in my hand, another employee came up to me, asking what I still needed. I told them I was waiting on another burrito. Then ANOTHER employee came up to me to see what I was waiting on and promptly went to check on my order!Look, every restaurant is going to make a mistake from time to time. Maybe you have to work in a restaurant to understand this, but there are alot of people rushing around to coordinate food service. I can't fault a restaurant for making a mistake from time to time, so what I'm rating them on is how they HANDLED the mistake. And Los Agaves handled it beautifully. I appreciated that so many people were taking responsibility for checking on their customer. They completed my order and handed me a free bottled Coke, which was unnecessary but greatly appreciated since my lunch break was a short window of time. It was in the middle of their mistake that I realized how great their service is!",5 star rating,Gretchen W.

The salsas are fantastic and we hardly had to wait for our food to come.Only downsides were that the guy taking our order ignored me and was blatantly more interested in my girlfriend, he couldn't really describe the dish when I asked about it, and one of the workers rushing to clean a table flicked her towel right by me and sent specks of water from the rag across me and my plate (totally understandable for how fast and busy the place was though).All in all a great meal, quick service, and one of the best mexican meals I have had.",5 star rating,John C.

The place was small and it looked bla.  We decided to stay anyway.  I ordered some chiles rellenos and they were simply amazing.  The salad was out of the ordinary-with mango sauce- but it was yummy.  Oh.. and I forgot to mention that they serve fresh made corn tortillas! that definitely won me over.  So if you are in the mood for authentic Mexican food -none of that Americanized shit- then consider this place.  I only gave it a 4 because I was expecting a better ambiance and their selection of alcohol was limited... who doesn't sell tequila at a Mexican restaurant?",4 star rating,Yuri F.
3/17/2013,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I hate to burst their bubble, but this is just three stars, which is, as they say, ""A-OK"" and I will tell you why it only rates three stars as we go along.Arrived on a Sunday at around 12:30 for lunch.  Went in the entrance at the corner, which looks like the main entrance, but isn't.  Found our way to the main area, where there was another entrance and the counter to place our order.  There was a line of at least ten people ahead of us.  I knew from reviews that we were to order first, then find a table. When we got close to the front of the line, I found out what TLOML wanted and stayed in line to order, sending him off to find a table, which he did.We got our drinks, chips, salsa (the salsa bar had nice choices with a good spice level) and settled in.  Our order was delivered within a reasonable length of time.  TLOML got the Burrito Mojado with chicken and said it was good.  I had the Agaves Burrito, and though it seemed a bit light on the halibut, it was heavy on the shrimp, so, overall, I was very pleased.  I wanted to order the burrito the first time without changing it.  Next time, I would leave out the lettuce.  Soggy lettuce just doesn't do it for me. The chipotle sauce that finished the burrito was wonderful.  I had the burrito with the house salad and beans.  The house salad was a lovely surprise, mixed spring greens with mango and what looked to be chopped dried cranberries and mandarin oranges.  The creamy dressing was a a bit sweet and the salad had too much dressing, but I was able to enjoy it.  I didn't really think it went with my burrito, though.  The beans were another matter.  Served in a crispy tortilla cup, they couldn't have been on the plate because they were so ""soupy"".  It seemed like they had made some sort of sauce, or blendered some of the beans, something.  I didn't like the flavor or the consistency.   Repellent!  Over all, I would rate my food 4 stars.The biggest problem for me is their routine of taking orders even if they don't have places for people to sit.  This meant that I had someone hovering over my shoulder constantly from the minute I had eaten about half my burrito.  It made the experience very uncomfortable.  Not only did I feel rushed, but I felt like I lacked privacy to talk and enjoy my food.  TLOML felt it as well, since I could see him glancing up repeatedly at the people hovering around our table.  At one point I even said to him, ""Yes, I KNOW I'M FINISHED WITH MY BURRITO.  But I want to sit a moment longer and relax and finish my drink!""  Honestly, I felt like turning around and saying to the vultures, ""WHAT?  Do you not understand PERSONAL SPACE?!""  One woman was no more than six inches away from my shoulder for the last 15 minutes of my meal.Places like Stone Fire Grill don't take your order if they don't have a table for you.  That seems like a reasonable way to handle it.We won't be returning unless we are having a very early or late meal.  While the food value for the money was excellent, the vultures ruined the meal.Just a heads up:  There was a notice in the window saying the ownership was going to change and that they were applying for an alcohol license.  Who knows what changes that will bring.",3 star rating,Allison K.

Was at first shocked that it wasnt a sit down restaurant but an order and then find a seat place. They bring your food and it's pretty fast for a place with a big menu like they have. You will have to search and stalk for a seat so be ready. I ordered off the specials board and my salmon tacos were amazing. Also got a ceviche appetizer and it was huge and loaded with seafood.

4/4/2012,"Long Beach, CA","Mmmm, yum!  I'd call this some good ""fresa"" Mexican food if u catch my drift.  It was quite yummy to me, the Mexican hubby would say it was just so-so.  We had pescado veracruzano and the agaves enchiladas!  We both agreed on the enchiladas-delish!  It came with rice and mixed greens,topped with a not too sweet mango relish (wouldn't call it salsa).  Perfect blend of flavors and spices for me.  Everything seemed so fresh and homemade.  Even the horchata and the jamaica seemed like it.  The perfectionist in me even appreciated the ""mom-like"" woman who seemed to stand in the kitchen making sure that everything came out just right.  The help there was also very nice, even grabbing salsa for the hubby before we realized it was a self-serve salsa bar.  Would definitely come here again if we are in the SB again!",4 star rating,Susan R.

10/31/2013,"San Diego, CA",Clearly I did not have the same opinion of this place as most people.My wife and I were passing through S.B. After a long bike ride and we were very hungry.We were headed to  Playa Azul since we had good food there before but decided to check yelp and this place popped up so we decided to give it a try.When we walked in and looked at the menu it wasn't your typical Mexican food and there were a lot of seafood items. I usually won't order seafood at a Mexican restaraunt because you don't know what the quality of it might be. But I went against my intuition and ordered the Los Agaves burrito with halibut but told them no shrimp so they said they would add more halibut. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas. While waiting for our food I went to the salsa bar which was quite extensive. I brought back a sampling of all of the salsas. For the most part they were just average. The fresca was kind of mushy and the roasted salsas lacked flavor. When my plate arrived the burrito was covered with a thick light brown sauce. There was a small salad that had small pieces of mango and cranberries with a very sweet creamy dressing that tasted liked 50/50 bar. The burrito had very little fish or anything else inside it. I suspect the fish may not have been halibut but bass from the texture and taste of it. Mostly it was a flour tortilla soaked in a thick goopy sauce and ultimately was a failure.  My wife's fajitas were a bit better. The chicken was perfectly cooked and good quality. The corn tortillas seemed to be freshly made and were maybe the highlight of the meal. The peppers and onions that came with the fajitas were totally drenched in oil and slimy. Neither of our dishes came with beans which I thought was odd. I often gauge a Mexican restaraunt by the quality of ther beans. Finally both the rice and chips seemed to be overly salted. We probably won't we returning here and I think There are better options in S.B.,3 star rating,J B.

6/14/2012,"Agoura Hills, CA","My wife and I were visiting Santa Barbara for the first time, and wandering around downtown looking for a place to eat. Most of the places along the ""strip"" weren't rated very highly in Yelp, and so we ended up going a mile or so away to give Los Agaves a try. I'm happy to say, we were pleasantly surprised.First, the staff was helpful and friendly, and actually seemed like they were genuinely concerned about our satisfaction. That was nice to see, particularly in a place that doesn't present itself as particularly upper crust (that's a compliment, by the way).Second, the food was not only better than I expected, but simply downright excellent. My wife's Agaves Burrito was tasty and surprisingly light, with a nice side salad that had a delightful dressing. My nachos were huge and very well done, with absolutely none of the greasiness I've come to expect from anything slathered with loads of cheese. In this case, there wasn't a single drop of grease, indicating quality ingredients and careful preparation. The salsa bar was also nicely appointed, with everything from tasty mild salsa to a hot (but not too hot) habanero version.I highly recommend Los Agaves if you're in Santa Barbara and looking for a good spot to eat. Mexican food isn't always the healthiest or lightest, but we managed to walk away satisfied and not feeling like we just took away a few years from our lives.",5 star rating,Mark C.

There is a great salsa bar so everyone can pick the type they want. The prices were reasonable. My dad and I both ordered the Molcajetes (chicken and beef) and it was delicious. I recently had it in Mexico and this was just as good. It was $13. It came with corn tortillas but if you want flour, just ask and they will bring it to you. The service was great.

Went there yesterday and got the Agaves burrito which has halibut and shrimp as well as guacamole inside and is topped with an aaahmazing chipotle sauce! My absolute favorite dish from here though is their Quesadillas de Flor de Calabaza. It's zucchini blossoms inside of a Oaxaca cheese quesadilla.

6/2/2010,"Santa Monica, CA","We just visited Los Agaves over the weekend after looking at some Yelp reviews by others and we decided to give it a try since we were in the area.As mentioned in other reviews, it was very busy and a bit hectic.  The seating is pretty tight and seems to work in this way: you get in line, you order and the staff tries to help you find a table.  If there aren't any available you have to stand around waiting for one.Once you're seated and have your food, it's pretty good.  They happened to be sold out of the chicken mole which seems a bit crazy given it was about 6pm and it was already all gone.  So my wife got the mole enchiladas instead and I got a chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco combo.  The quality of the meat and chicken was great, no low-grade fatty chunks found.  The mole enchiladas were really good, the mole sauce was excellent.  My taco and regular chicken enchilada were good but not really anything special.So foodwise it's good but you can feel like you're being rushed in there.",3 star rating,Mario C.

I was so full after ordering that and chips + guac (split with 3 friends), it's definitely worth the money.

5/3/2013,"Encinitas, CA","Everyone said this was the place to go for good Mexican food but I was pretty disappointed. I ordered a simple garden burrito, and a salad because everyone said the dressing was great and it was. Unfortunately they came back and told me they ran out the the veggies used in my burrito. I asked if they could please just do a rice and bean burrito or two that were of the same value, nothing fancy. My garden burrito was over $8.00 mind you. They brought back 1, just 1, bean and rice burrito. It gets better. The bean and rice burrito had so much rice in it that I was four bites deep and more than 1/3 of the way through and still had no beans. I called the waiter and told him what was up, and we discussed an alternative. I just said to please bring more of the salad because that was good, but to make it the same price equivalent otherwise I was getting ripped off. Did they? No. It was tiny. At this point they were totally closing Up early because they had run out of ingredients, the staff had sat down to eat and I said f'it and just left. I got ripped off for the cost of my burrito , the service was really not great, I stood in line for over a half hour to get in, and the two tables next to me didn't  get stuff they ordered either so, yeah it was not great and I still have yet to see what all the fuss was about. Make sure you get what you pay for and that they f'ing pay attention to your gosh damn table after the food is brought or you'll never get what you paid for. They also need to move the salsa bar away from the restrooms, because that's seriously like the worst place possible and it's just plain nasty. Put it by the rear door where there's some room. I hope it was a bad night and they read this and offer a redo at their expense but I doubt it.",2 star rating,Jasper T.

3/1/2011,"San Francisco, CA","I think the glowing Yelp reviews raised my expectations a little too high.  We chowed on the molcajete, a yummy soupy cheesy dish that I believe is the precursor to fajitas; carnitas, which were falling off the bone tender and served with delectable homemade tortillas; and shrimp tacos which were fresh, light and tasty.  Everything was good and the service was friendly, but for me the food wasn't quite as flavorful or unique as La Superica.  Nonetheless, highly recommended, especially when you're burnt out on the long lines at Superica or sitting in that funky tent.",4 star rating,Katy M.

After getting sort of lost and driving through a semi-industrial area blanketed with the smell of burning plastic, we emerged from the stink into a cool latin stretch of businesses including this one. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. We had the carnitas tacos and ceviche both of which were great. Salsa bar gave us plenty of extra flavor. Well worth the hunt!",5 star rating,Claude F.

If you love spicy, they have the most delicious and spicy salsa for the free chips they give you. I always order the enchiladas, it will definitely fill you up because it comes with a lot of rice and beans. I believe it was the Halibut enchiladas that really stood out to me, it had a spicy chipotle salsa on top and was overall just fantastic. This place is order at the counter but the interior decor makes it cute and comfortable. The staff are always very friendly and willing to help.",5 star rating,Jennifer Z.

The manager, Armando, was really friendly and runs a very efficient operation.

We came in at about 11 am on a Sunday. Lady greeted us as we entered the restaurant, nice without being overbearing. Explained that we needed to order at the register and that we can sit anywhere we wanted. She gave us the breakfast menu and asked if we wanted the regular menu as well. We ordered from the breakfast menu, hubs had breakfast enchiladas with eggs over easy and I had the machaca hash with an horchata. As soon as we sat down, they brought us chips, still warm from the fryer. Gotta love free chips, but on top of that they have the best salsa bar to go with it. No teeny plastic cups, but actual mini salsa bowls to ladle the homemade salsa into. HELLO! The food came pretty fast and didn't disappoint. Homemade horchata, OMG!

3/28/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Ahh Los Agaves. The one place in town that can charge $3 for a bottle of coke with a straight face, and, likely, some attitude. Overpriced. But they have the best salsa in town, by far. Staff can be kinda rude, but sometimes super nice. I'm so up and down with this place. To the staff's credit, they are always super busy, and I don't blame them for being kinda short sometime. Still, it's not exactly cozy, like a lot of other delicious Mexican spots in town. They have a bit of a 'too cool' vibe goin on. But, again, to their credit, the are super popular.

4/18/2011,"Santa Maria, CA","Don't come here expecting to eat Mexican food like you've never had before.  I agree with the reviewer who said it's standard Mexican food.CONSThis is not a place for a long sit-down dinner.  It's a mix between a fast food joint (stand in line, order, find your own seat) and a sit-down place (a waiter will bring your food to you).  Once you get your food, you will most likely never see your server again.We got there before the dinner rush and still had to wait long enough to finish two baskets of chips and two drink refills before the food came.  It can get very loud in the restaurant, making it difficult to carry a conversation.The tortillas and chips arrived piping hot but all the main dishes arrived luke warm.  The cheese in our chile relleno was so cold it was hard.PROSI highly recommend the sea and land molcajate.  I cannot eat cooked fish so I asked for it with beef, chicken and shrimp and it was excellent!  My favorite is the tortillas though- very doughy- the best I've ever had.CONCLUSIONIt's good food especially if the food could be served at the right temperature, but not exactly sure what the hype is about.  El Torito Grill is just as good and you get unlimited tortillas and an actual server for the same price.",3 star rating,Shilbee C.
5/27/2011,"Alhambra, CA","I usually hate places where you order and then take a number.  It makes me anxious.  However, their Chiles Nortenos is the best dish I've ever had in my life.  Period.  I tend to crave chile rellenos more than anyone I've ever met, and the Chiles Nortenos is the perfect marriage between shrimp, a PERFECTLY roasted chile, the most amazing cheese ever, and some sort of mystery sauce that brings everything together.  It was one of those experiences where you have to keep pinching yourself to see if you're really awake or dreaming.  Pros: Chiles Nortenos.  Chiles Nortenos.  Good and friendly service.  Chiles Nortenos.Cons: I strongly dislike ordering from a line and taking a number to the table.  Also, it was kind of cramped, and too loud.  Read: not great ambiance.  However, all of this is overshadowed by the food...I live in Los Angeles, but please believe the next time I'm even in the vicinity of Santa Barbara, I will be stopping by Los Agaves.",5 star rating,CL L.

2/25/2013,"Denver, CO","This place has really good food. I ordered the ceviche app (which is WAY too big for one person) and a fajitas plate. It was a lot of food, so that shouldn't be a problem for anyone. I was able to take half of my plate home to eat before my ""way too early for breakfast"" flight. Fajitas were good. Nice portions of meat. Lots of veggies to add in. They have the nice salsa bar which is really nice to change your flavors up with. The app was good, but I tried to eat it all (can't take home acid cooked fish) and it got to be a bit much (my fault though). The format of eating can feel chaotic, with ordering from the counter, the specials menu on the chalk board was almost as big as the print menu (but a nice addition), and then having to basically serve yourself, find your seat, etc. etc. I'm not a whiner and after assessing things, I managed just fine. The staff was attentive after that too. Would go again and would recommend too.",4 star rating,Matt V.
7/7/2013,"West Hills, CA",The food was great as one could tell from the long lines. We were there on a Sunday around 1:00 so that could be part of the reason. There is a fresh salsa bar with one of the best pico de gallos salsa I ever had. Clearly freshly made. Really good food at great prices. My only complaint is that once you order your food it is difficult to find a place to sit and eat. I wish there were a way that one didn't have to hover over people who are about to finish eating so one can grab their table. I hate that! But I guess inexpensive good food places can't be perfect.,4 star rating,Lori S.

4/7/2013,"Boston, MA","I grew up in Southern California but I've been living in the northeast for the past decade. The saddest thing about living in Boston is the lack of quality Mexican restaurants. So on my latest trip to the west coast, I was lucky enough to eat here. Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. Very casual here. You order from the counter and then its first come first serve as far as tables. I understand the restaurant can get very busy so I was lucky to come with my family at around 4:30pm. There were plenty of seats. I tried the Chicken Poblano Mole. The best dish I had here was the Molcahetes. Delicious rice and beans as well. The staff is very helpful in coming around and making sure everything is ok and bringing over chips. The salsa bar is also a highlight.

Oh yeah, we sampled the entire variety of salsas available and can report real heat from the Habanero, a lovely lightness to the tomatillo, and an amazing avocado sauce.  (Okay, amazing?  I just like a little alliteration sometimes...  It was very good.)PS.  My vegan companion reported a fine vegan burrito.",4 star rating,jeremy t.

11/4/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","This review is based on 2 really strange experiences I had here.  The first time I went, I ordered the tampiquena.  The guy at the counter told me that they did not have it-- they were ""out.""  OK, sure... my first time... maybe a popular dish-- but it was only about 7pm on a weeknight.  I sat down and noticed that the people who were behind me in line sat down at the table next to me.  My food was brought out to me, and it looked good.  But then I heard the person bringing the food to the people at the table next to me, who were in line behind me, say ""Here is your tampiquena.""  I didn't know if I heard it right, but the dish looked just like what I imagined the tampiquena dish would be.  I let it go, whatever.A couple of weeks later, I went back because the food was decent and the place was close by.  Again, dinner time on a weeknight.  The same guy was at the counter.  I still wanted to try the tampiquena dish, so I ordered it again.  But again, he told me, ""We're out.""  I said, ""Really?  Wow, popular dish, huh?""  No reply.  So I ordered something else and moved on.  But, lo and behold, half way through eating, I heard a waiter announcing the arrival of a tampiquena to another table across the room.At best this was simple misunderstanding (but twice?).  At worst, racism. (And, yes, don't be naive, racism exists in all flavors in all parts of our country.) Regardless, I will not be going back.  If you are one of the chosen that is allowed to have the tampiquena, consider yourself lucky!",1 star rating,Hugh N.

It was bland to be honest. I had their homemade sopes plate and it was weird, chewy, and lacking. The rice and beans, which are usually one of my favorite parts of any mexican dish, were nothing note-worthy. Maybe I caught them on a bad day?? I'm sorry because this place gets so many good reviews, but I will continue going to Super Cuca's on the Mesa...now there's a place that makes me come back the very next day!SIde note: great place for kids although the menu has no kids' menu, order at counter and seat yourself.",3 star rating,J K.

1/20/2015,"PANORAMA CITY, CA","Ok...trust me when I tell you that when you are visiting Santa Barbara and are looking for good, authentic, close to home made cooking Mexican food, then you must eat at Los Agaves. First of all, do not be put off by the long line that at times could be out the front door and also the amount of patrons and noise once you are inside the restaurant because once you order your food and have that first bite you will be hooked. My fiance and I tried several ""Mexican"" restaurants suggested by locals who are also of Mexican descent and was not particularly happy or satisfied with their food. Then I decided to not listen and hit the various restaurants outside of State Street and boy what a find. We have ordered out several times while we have vacationed and eaten there several times as well. In fact, we have gone as far as driving out to SB to meet with friends and made sure we placed a take out order to take home back to L.A. Regardless of eating at the restaurant, ordering for take out, or driving back to L.A., the food is delicious. I have had their Nachos (A Meal of itself), The Guadalajara Enchiladas, Tampiquena (Highly Recommend), and Chicken Burrito (Also Highly Recommend). To top it off, what an amazing Salsa Bar. Again, (and I speak from experience) nothing like close to homemade Salsa. If at the restaurant you can select all or few of the many choices of Salsa from Chipotle (Hot) to Pico De Gallo (Low). I sometimes shake my head and wonder why some locals feel as though that most of the great Mexican restaurants are on State Street but take it from me from a Mexican American who has had many of the same dishes that Los Agaves offers, they are pretty darn close to what my Momma cooks to this day. My final take on Los Agaves is that I highly recommend it but beware of the limited parking available, the amount of patrons, and finding a table but once you find parking (usually on the street), you get in line, order your food, take a number to your open table, and have the food brought to your table right out of the kitchen you will be in for an experience that will hopefully have you coming back again, again, and again. Looking forward to my return in February 2015.",5 star rating,Hector C.

6/28/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","My wife and I love Mexican food.  We were tourists in Santa Barbara so we only went her once.  The food was unbelievably good.  We like what we get at other restaurants very much, but this was different.  It was much more like food we would get in a real home, made by a very good cook.  If their food can be so good I wondered why more restaurants don't do it.  I have a theory.  If you go to  a sit down full service restaurant prices are higher because that costs money.  The ingredients are often (but not always) a bit higher quality or prepared to a bit higher standard.  This is what we prefer.  Restaurants where you order from a counter are usually cheaper because they don't have to hire and pay a bunch of waiters, hosts and bus staff.  Los Agaves makes you order at the counter, but has higher prices like a full service restaurant.  So my theory is this is how they make their food so ""real"" and not like typical restaurant food.  The cost savings from people ordering at the counter and getting their own drinks and salsas allows them to spend more money on the ingredients, preparation and training.  All I know is it was unique.  We would probably become regulars, but we only come to Santa Barbara once every few years so that won't be possible.",5 star rating,James P.

12/10/2012,"Garden Grove, CA","This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the Santa Barbara area. Some of my favorites include the Los Agaves enchiladas, Chiles Norteños, and any of the meats. All of their food is incredibly flavorful. Especially their rice. I have no clue how they do it, but the rice is so delicious. This place is a gem. This place is usually pretty packed, and sometimes the service suffers because of this. However, that doesn't mean it is bad service, just that it is excellent service when there are less people. I highly recommend Los Agaves if you are looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Katie A.
11/20/2012,"Boca Raton, FL",I wish I would have read the reviews prior to going to the restaurant because my approach would have been different.  It took over an hour to get our meal.  They lost the order and the patrons never noticed that we were had been waiting for a long time.  The wine was great!  I ordered the chiles rellenos norteños and my boyfriend ordered lengua.  He loved his meal but I was disappointed with my chiles. I think the key for some going to this restaurant for the first time is to ask for the menu while on line and recognize that is like a taqueria where there is no service otherwise it a good restaurant.,4 star rating,Norka P.
2/22/2012,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA","Go. There. Now. Los Agaves is proof that not everything good revolves around ""state street"". It's off the beaten path and well worth every turn you make. Best Mexican food I have EVER had. Start to finish was great. Line moved fast. Service was great. Salsa bar...let's talk about that for a minute. HUGE selection of various homemade salsas, my favorites being the tomatillo and habanero. No (2 oz.) mini containers either. They provide actual bowls, yes bowls, for their salsa. They mean business, and so do I. I filled up 4 different kinds and enjoyed every single bite. FYI. Most of them border on spicy, which I love. But if you are sensitive to spice, beware. Moving along, the guacamole. I have never, yep never, ordered guacamole that I didn't need to doctor up with lime, salt, etc. Their guacamole is fantastic. As far as entrees, hubby and I ordered steak burritos. Delish!!!! Not one bite of gristle, great flavor, cooked perfect, AND a generous amount of steak! Their side rice was a pleasant surprise. Fantastic. I highly recommend this place. It just may make me want to take a trip from Santa Monica to Santa Barbara much sooner than later! Trust me, when you live in a beach town, it's hard to justify going to another one, just for food. But I see it happening! And soon. Can't wait!",5 star rating,Mayada A.

7/30/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","The place was packed at lunchtime on a Monday. Finding a table was an issue, but the wait wasn't bad.Here's what's remarkable:the salsa bar--these are SERIOUSLY great salsasthe chips--served warm and thin exactly as I like 'emthe horchata--best in town, no ice in the waythe quantity of food served--plenty there, you won't leave hungrythe salad--the best salad I have EVER had in a Mexican restaurant!Here's what's not: I wasn't wowed by the main dishes. The sopes were soggy. The chiles nortenos were only so-so. They had plenty of shrimp, it's just that the shrimp didn't have the freshness this dish demands. Plus, this dish was soggy too.Perhaps we just ordered poorly, though the nice fellow at the counter had recommended the chiles nortenos as being very popular. I'm a big fan of the #16 at the joint up the street; the main dishes at Los Agaves we had did not compare and were pricier.I'd return, but I'd make other selections here next time.",4 star rating,A M.
8/20/2013,"Pasadena, CA","As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of mexican food, I can confidently say that this is the best mexican food I've ever had. Born and raised here in So Cal, I've tasted everything within the spectrum of ""mexican"" food, and this place has to be at the top. Their salsa bar has eight-ish different types of homemade salsas ranging from mild to hot and they are all incredible. I had the burrito with shrimp and fish and it was just unreal. The sauce on top was the best I've ever had. My friends got a pork quesadilla thing, the shrimp and fish enchiladas (also with the amazing sauce), and then a fish plate and we were all absolutely amazed by how great our food was. The place was crazy busy, but we found a table relatively quickly and the service was incredible great. Food came out hot about five to ten minutes after we ordered, we had our chip basket refilled very quickly, and the lady taking our order was great at helping us choose a menu item and did so with a smile. I wish there was a six star option for food that is on an entirely different level than the others, but I will unfortunately have to settle with a well-deserved five star rating.",5 star rating,Drew A.

8/19/2012,"Duarte, CA","WOW!!! Kudos to yelp for recommending this restaurant. The food here is so incredible. The chef has really given thought to their menu and how the flavors come together. I first whet here for dinner. (tip... have your partner get a table while you wait in line to order, this is not a traditional sit down and wait for a waiter or waitress. You wait in line to order and then they will bring the food to your table). In addition to their menu they have a board with about 20 more dishes. Everything I saw come out of the  kitchen look fantastic! I decided on the salmon tacos and it was topped with pineapple and some type of sauce. I put on their own avocado salsa (which has a nice kick) and it was delicious! They included Mexican rice which was cook perfect and a side salad that completed the spicy tacos perfect! It had a Mango dressing that was cool and slightly sweet, I ask the Manager about this and he said it was a smaller version of their ""Ensalada Vallarta"". I was so impressed with the food and effort put in by the staff, I went back the next day for lunch... I had to try their ""Molcajetes Sea and Earth"" which is Steak, chicken, 3 jumbo shrimp and grilled fish cooked in a salsa sauce with Mexican cheese, roasted pepper, onion and topped with fresh avocado. It was AWESOME!  (tip order a side of tortillas, It's not included).Make sure to order their fresh guacamole to start off with.I look forward going back to Santa Barbara to visit and this will be one of my stops for sure.",5 star rating,Ron B.

We ended up at Los Agaves by chance after another recommended Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood was closed. The service was great and prices are reasonable. We ordered the Fish Tacos and Agaves Enchiladas with shrimp and halibut. The chipotle sauce was unbelievable! The salsa bar is a nice addition and offers a lot of different choices. I would absolutely recommend eating here. We were passing through Santa Barbara on a road trip and wished we had gone back for dinner before we left the area. Too much to eat at the same twice in one day?!,5 star rating,Julie R.
7/16/2011,"Atascadero, CA","5 stars because I couldn't think of one bad thing to say about the place.  The salsa bar is superb.  We only tried 4 of the many types of salsa on hand, and we all took turns changing out minds as to which was our favorite.  It's a walk up to order, go sit down and get served place, which is fine with me, and They don't have any margaritas, but that's fine because I didn't go there to drink, I went to eat.  Lots of Mexican beers are available to pair with the excellent food, which is really fresh.  I personally had the Mole Chicken enchiladas, and they may have been the best I've ever had, and everyone had exactly the same thing to say about their own dish which ranged from seafood to cheese quesadillas.  My enchiladas where stuffed with lean grilled white chicken, and the mole sauce was amazing.  Now unlike Seth W. I haven't eaten in every Mexican restaurant in a 500 mile radius, so I can't say it's the best mexican food in the world, but I have eaten at most of the good ones in SLO county, and this beats them hands down.

Eventually some very nice lady came over and greeted us & told us (2 adults& 2 children) that we order at the counter and we find a place to sit. We arrived at 12:30 pm on a Saturday. The place seemed busy with no where to sit but we were told by three staff members that they were looking for a spot for us, as their seating consist mostly of 2 person seating. They put two tables together and we were seated.(1)We ordered  3 Tacos and a plate of rice and beans for the kids.they loved it! (2)A chicken mole soft taco special plate consist of 2 tacos rice and beans. generous portions, and I have to say I am a very pick eater but this was delicious. The chicken was great! the rice and beans were also great tasting. Best chicken tacos ever tasted from a restaurant, anywhere!  (3)Last dish was a seafood burrito with rice and beans. It was apparently the best seafood burrito he had ever tasted. He was in awe of the flavors.Being Hispanic and having tasted some of the best tasting foods from many different restaurants, family, friends, etc..this was one the top ones we have ever tasted. It was a great food experience.  The place also offers chips and salsa when you get seated. The salsa was great! I really enjoyed this place and would love to go again. The staff was very helpful and courteous and genuinely kind. Tip Tip Tip they deserve it.  P.S I briefly spoke to a staff member as I stated that it was a bit busy and his response was"" its slow today, we usually have a line out the door and around the corner"". Apparently, it gets really packed but  we know why.",5 star rating,R S.

Once you sit down, you really get great service. I love the decor, the art work is very pleasant to the eye. And the food is amazing. It is actually quite authentic. It makes restaurants like ""El Torito"" look like a joke. Really, this is probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants out there.",5 star rating,Dr. m. B.

7/26/2010,"Spicewood, TX",What a great place.  The food was very unique and the price very reasonable.  The molcajete was one of the best and most unique Mexican dishes I've ever had.   This dish is a must try if you go to this place. My wife had the grilled halibut fish tacos and the quality of halibut was excellent.  You usually don't see that in fish tacos.   The atmosphere is very casual and it's in a section of Santa Barbara I didn't know existed.  Looks very working class.  Put this on your list if you go to Santa Barbara.,4 star rating,Doug W.

3/29/2013,"Goleta, CA","Don't get me wrong, I loved the burrito I had when I went to Los Agaves( my one and only time). But everything else was a complete disaster from the moment I walked through the door.  I stood in line for over a half hour waiting to order food. When I finally reached the front counter to take an order, the guy went through THREE phone calls before he even looked at me to take my order. There was a huge line in back of me, and someone else was taking orders over the phone as well.  I think this is horrible customer service.  So then, I finally ordered and went to go join my bf, who had meanwhile grabbed a seat while we were waiting.  He griped about how several waiters had told him that he couldnt sit there, etc etc. Well, what was he supposed to do? the place is PACKED, there are NO tables available, and when someone asked if he wanted the table, he didnt realize he was going to get several snarly remarks from staff. We sat down, and the food came.  My order was wrong, and they forgot the salad. My boyfriend stuffed his burrito down.  I went to the front to ask about the salad, and I stood there for over 5 minutes waiting for someone to ask me what I needed.  I finally got someone's attention, and they looked at me as if I was lying about ordering a salad, and of course my recepit was only a credit card receipt and did not have an itemized account of what I had ordered. They finally brought the salad, which was delicious. My burrito was great too. No complaints on the food, it was great, but customer service was the wrost I have had in all of SB. I cant rate below a 3 because the food is great, but I'm not sure if i will want to return to be treated like trash again.. HELLO im your customer, and I work in the customer service field and would have NEVER treated or let any other employees treat customers like that. finished off the night basically standing in the los agaves kitchen trying to get someones attention so that I could have a to go box. horrible. I have other mexican places in SB that I will go to because their customer service is excellent, and the food is great too.",3 star rating,Kathleen D.

The salsa bar was a nice touch.  Nothing was greasy or heavy.  I would highly recommend it.,4 star rating,D W.

7/16/2011,"Ventura County, CA","Excellent Mexican Food! Went to Los Agaves on a Saturday just after 5pm. There was a little parking behind the restaurant which was nice and also conveniently located not far from the 101. First, you walk in and order at the counter, we were greeted with menus as we gave our first look. I ordered a cheese enchilada and steak taco combo plate and my husband ordered red and green chicken enchiladas and crispy taco combo plate. We found a table, there were some open spots to choose from at the time we went. There were Unlimited refills on drinks and a great salsa bar with lots of choices (my fav was the avocado-cilantro). Our entrees were fantastic! My steak was delicious with the taco and the red sauce with the cheese enchilada was very flavorful. My husband thought this was some of the best Mexican he's had in a long time, I would definitely agree. We'll be back and we're excited to try more of their very enticing menu whenever we're in the SB area again, hopefully soon!",5 star rating,Cynthia M.

I got the Agaves fish and shrimp burrito, it was the freshest most delicious burrito i have ever had, and it came along with an equally delicious salad. The sauces they use are tasty and they have the most impressive salsa bar I have yet to see. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth the extra few bucks.",5 star rating,Duran R.

I have brought friends in and we never have had all in our party served! Can you imagine the embarrassement of taking friends to dinner in which the guest of honor is never served his meal? Then, we were blamed for the error and asked for more money than the $133 we had already paid! Every time I take friends to this place the food is good but inevitably, someone in our party does not get served, we wait half and hour for the food and all have to eat in shifts or the food that has been served to some in our party gets cold. This is a place that is disorganized and rude to it's customers. Good food, but with a ""soup nazi"" mentality. After many attempts, they have finally lost our business...",1 star rating,T D.

12/9/2020,"Montebello, CA","Was craving some refreshing food and decided to try Los Agaves since we were in the area. There was a bit of a wait (COVID-times) but the line moves quickly. They have outdoor seating the last time I went. We got a margarita and ceviche. The price is a bit steep but the portions make sense for the price. I could probably get full off the ceviche alone and still have leftovers. There was a good balance of all the ingredients and it was so yummy and refreshing, I kinda wish I could order a quart to-go and just snack on it while going home. This was definitely a great choice and I will visit again if I'm in the area and craving pretty authentic Mexican food. The only con I have is that they didn't have hand sanitizer for those who were dining outside. Even though they clean the tables, having sanitizer is pretty necessary in current times.",4 star rating,Irene W.
11/21/2020,"Patterson, CA",Went during COVID so it was outdoor dining only. We ordered inside and took a seat at an open table out back. Each table has umbrellas to keep you cool from the beating down sun. The service was great and all employees wear masks and gloves. Our waitress was very attentive and kept our drinks and chips topped off when needed.The food was so fresh and delicious. The presentation was wonderful and the cold drinks were super refreshing. Especially on a hot sunny day. The freshly made guacamole was so good and some of the best chips and salsa I've tried yet. They had a great variety of  delicious salsas to choose from. They have veggie options and the vegetarian burrito was awesome. Everything we ordered was great right down to the rice and beans.For quality food with the freshest ingredients this is the place. They take pride in their food and are super clean especially during COVID times. Can't wait to return.,5 star rating,Robert W.
11/10/2020,"Upland, CA",I treated my husband to a weekend in Santa Barbara for his birthday and Los Agaves was our first dining spot based off the number of reviews and recommendations from Yelp. I was disappointed in their COVID-dining options but it's evident most people take this food to go or order via Delivery Apps. Guests order from the front and are given a number to find a table. Service was great but the food was disappointing as we were expecting authentic Mexican food. The portions received were not worth the price-tag and the restrooms were putrid (not to the fault of the restaurant). I'd only recommend this spot if you're looking for a hot spot in Santa Barbara otherwise there's a ton of other less-popular Mexican restaurants along State St.,3 star rating,Diana A.
2/9/2021,"Riverside, CA","I was quite disappointed with my meal since I had high expectations based on the high ratings on Yelp. I got the Agaves burrito, which was a fish and shrimp burrito covered with chipotle sauce. It was not hot when it arrived to the table, and the poor burrito was literally drowned in sauce. The sauce was tasty but way too overpowering since I could barely taste any of the other ingredients in the burrito. The burrito was also on the pricey side ($16.50), but I guess the higher price could be because it came with a side salad and some rice. My boyfriend ordered the fajitas, and he also thought the food was average.",3 star rating,Jennifer H.
5/21/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Hi. I tried to look for an email to contact the supervisor or someone but I can't find anywhere so I guess this is the only spot left. I'm a Mom of two kids and have a husband, run a full-time business, so I've got a pretty busy schedule. Thought I'd order out for once and something special so on my way to pick up my daughter from preschool I called at 2:35pm Los Agaves in Goleta to put an order in for two combo enchiladas meals, one kids quesadilla, and chips/guacamole to be picked up, they lady on the phone said they we're not busy so it'd be ready in 10 minutes. I said I won't be there until after that so no worries see them soon. The order came to $49 something and I thought.. WOW. That's a lot for two adult meals, a kids meal, and chips/guacamole, but hey it's special and yummy and we're eating out tonight.... 3:15pm I get to the restaurant to pick up my order with my two young kids (just in time to get home for my daughters 3:30pm piano lesson).. and no customers in the restaurant or front desk, and I get there and they haven't even made my order. Shoot. Anyways I pay for the meal I told my family we were eating tonight, and it wasn't till I left the restaurant at 3:30pm and made it home by 3:40pm, late for my daughters piano lesson. Food was nothing special, wasn't bad but wasn't $49. I wouldn't go back unless they had better customer service and better pricing.

5/18/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Hands down one of the best Mexican food restaurants. All their locations are fantastic so I wouldn't bother distinguishing one from the other. There are other, more famous, Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara but to be honest, they aren't as good as Los Agaves. Los Agaves is the sort of place you crave and keep coming back to. It's the sort of place where you still make an indecent sound with that first bite even if you had it the day before. My personal favorite here is the Enchilada Suizas. I have it far more often than I should for my health but it's just soooooo good. If you have any love for the dish, I guarantee you this is going on your permanent rotation of food to get here in SB. And if they're out of Enchilada Suizas, the Enchilada Guadalajara with Green Sauce and Chicken is a very close dish to fill the craving.",5 star rating,Eben M.
12/2/2020,"Fullerton, CA","This spot is the most reviewed restaurant in Santa Barbara and it lived up to its name! The food was delicious and service was speedy. We came by at 1 o'clock on a Tuesday and just beat the line!We ordered over the phone thinking that they didn't have dine in. The food was ready in about 10-15 minutes, so fast! And when we were picking up, we saw that the outdoor dining was opened. We ended up sitting there (we probably the only people eating in to-go containers).We got the chile poblano and salmon tacos. Both were very delicious! We wouldn't have ordered the chile poblano had we not seen another reviewer on yelp. We gave it a try and didn't regret it! And we were afraid the salmon would be dry but man, it was succulent and cooked to perfection! If you aren't a fan or pineapple, you probably wouldn't like it because this dish is packed with pineapple flavors.Normally we aren't a big fan or Mexican food but this one is an exception. The flavors are good and they weren't too strong-y-mexican-y. The portion is also not very big, so it doesn't keep you full for a whole day. We were able to eat a normal dinner afterwards.",5 star rating,Magda N.

11/1/2020,"Culver City, CA",Not sure why we just barely discovered this place.  Perhaps because we always go to our favorite SB Mexican place down the street from Los Agaves.  We ordered the Agaves enchiladas and cheese enchiladas with crunchy beef taco and boy oh joy where they delicious!  The guava margarita was very refreshing as well. No wonder they have great reviews and earned Michelin star.  A MUST TRY IN SB.  But I'm know that one try wouldn't be enough so we will surely be back here!,5 star rating,Gen C.

The food had a great taste and they served it really fast regardless of the amount of people they had. The place has enough sitting space and it's kids friendly.

1/19/2019,"Newark, CA","Wow. For a sec, I thought many SB restaurants were rated high and it may just be the hype, but not this one.  It looked like a sit down restaurant but you order first to get your number, then proceed to get salsas at the bar and then choose a seat.  They bring the chips to you and gladly give refills.The salsas: what a treat. at least 5 to choose from and they all have a distinct taste.  They each have descriptions too which help.  I tried 4 and liked each.  One was dark in color, near brown, and had a hint of garlic in it.  The typical pico de gallo was there and the red salsa with bits of cilantro.  They had two green salsas but i preferred the avocado based salsa.  The tomatillo tasted just a bit tart and thats all I tasted.  The chips are lighter than I normally enjoy but still good.Chile verde burrito: that filling was divine.  Melted cheese and refried beans and chunks of tender pork morsels..mere perfection.  I only wished it was a bit bigger.  Its smaller than the typical super burrito at taquerias.Huarache: Oh my...I have had them a few times but this has to be the best.  The patty was soft yet crisp.  So good I did not even apply salsa.  It did have some green sauce on top and the tender carne asada was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Al pastor tacos: Truly delightful.  The slight crispness of it was heaven.  It had the perfect amount of seasoning which makes me reminisce of the past..I have had it just like this at maybe one other place.  That rare to find.  The pliable corn tortillas had a slight chew that was a great vessel for the main star of the show...al pastor.  And may I add, they had a generous serving of meat.  RIce N Beans: beans were okay.  I felt it could use some salt.  The rice was perfect. I can't wait to go back one day..Only slight deterrent are the prices which are a bit higher than most Mexican restaurants.",5 star rating,Kimberly C.
8/18/2015,"Torrance, CA","Los Agaves is a must try if you are looking for something different. The food is very light, yet  flavorful. It was very busy when we came, but the line moves quickly. After ordering, you take your number to your table, and the food is delivered to you. Service was super friendly, and the wine was nicely priced.What we ordered:Zucchini Blossom Quesdailla: I'm so glad this was in season and we got to try it. It is not the kind of quesdailla you are used to. The tortilla was very different. It was so light and crispy, it reminded me of really good tempura. The filling was also very light and very subtle. It was almost like eating air, but in a good way. Not heavy or greasy at all.Agaves Enchiladas: Seafood stuffed enchiladas with a delicious creamy sauce. This was by far my favorite dish. Carne Azteca: A sirloin steak, cheese stuff chile, a half link of chorizo, and beans in a cute tortilla cup. The chorizo and stuffed chile were the standouts.If you are ever in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by.",5 star rating,Kyung E.

Man, oh man, did it blow our expectations out of the water. We started with the queso fundido... which had a nice twist with bell peppers inside and the chorizo was different (but awesome) than I expected.My husband had a picante margarita with mezcal (which is not something we normally drink, but YOLO right?). He loved the margarita, but his own personal preference was if he were to order it again he would order it with tequila instead of mezcal since it's more drinkable.Finally he had the ceviche verde and I had the enchiladas ensadas.

They have a diverse menu, ample seating with a charming ambiance and excellent service. Prices are a bit higher than your average neighborhood taqueria but that's because the ingredients are high quality and fresh -and you'll taste the difference. The place is almost always packed (because it's no secret that the food is good) and you order at the counter so be prepared to wait in line during peak hours. But don't worry, it moves quickly and tables open up fast. My favorite dishes include the Mole Enchiladas and the Los Agaves (seafood) Burrito but, it's tough to go wrong no matter what you order.",5 star rating,DJ W.

I've been in the food industry forever and learned this is how you prevent errors on both sides, I talked to an employee Abraham who was totally rude and sure of himself, said they dont go over with guest, that's nuts especially the way things are boxed, things are separated, again this helps everyone  verify things are correct, I had to go all the way to store to get my food, how is guest to know there are multiple bags when one bag has 4 boxes exactly how many entrees you ordered, unless the take out person goes over it with you, horrible service by Abraham, never do take out again",1 star rating,Josh H.

Me, just being on Yelp, found Los Agaves on the Top 3 for Santa Barbara. So I was like...let's go to both places!This place was the clear winner. Seriously.Agaves burrito ($13.50)- Fresh halibut and shrimp, roasted red peppers, onions, Monterey Jackcheese, lettuce,guac, topped w/ chipotle sauce. Served w/ rice, lettuce, sour cream, guac, and pico de gallo. And an amazing salad.Burrito mojado ($10.95)-Wet burrito w/ grilled chicken or steak, pinto beans and queso fresco topped with salsa roja. With salad and rice, lettuce sour cream, guac, pico de gallo.They bring a bag of chips that you can eat and nibble at first. (Sauce is on the side)With agaves burrito- the salad was amazing. There was a mango and balsamic addition which was made by them. Tasted amazing with mixed greens. It was really really good. :O It was a little bit spicy for someone who can't handle at all, but even if you can handle a little... it's okay. The shrimp and halibut crunched in our mouths. Omg so good.Burrito mojado- the wet burrito was really interesting, At first- how do I hold it? Use a fork. Makes life easier. It was muy delish! The steak was really moist and the sour cream and guac on the outside was an excellent addition to it. OH so good MUST TRY. 10/10They have a lot of sauces on the side that you can try and add. Mild, medium, hot, and mas!Oh dear god I was so glad we came here first. When I have a chance to write another review, I'll write about the next taco place we ate at.PLUS 2 burritos make 4 people full. :OWe're still talking about the agaves salad. SO GOOD",5 star rating,Raymond L.

1/2/2019,"Montebello, CA","I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob from Los Angeles and in the past I haven't been blown away by Santa Barbara popular Mexican spots till now. Had the burrito mojado with their homemade horchata. Wow the burrito was amazing! Tortilla was so soft I swear it mush be handmade, plenty of meat and delicious sauce on top. Horchata tasted legit and not overly sweet. Lots of salsas to pick from. They are spicy but to me lack some flavor. Free chips too! Like a fool, i forgot my purse and drove back home to LA without noticing. I called and they graciously had my purse with everything in it the next day. While here again I tried the agaves enchiladas. Wow never had seafood enchiladas but these were just as amazing as the burrito. The SAUCE was so good!!! I must come back to try the mole",5 star rating,Michelle G.

It wasn't similar at all except that it was also tacos and they were also delicious. I keep saying I'm going to try la super rica almost next door and always with a line but I can't bring myself to since I'm only in Santa Barbara once a month or so.I had the substitute Baja tacos which I thought had a little too much sauce on the cabbage but it didn't matter bc it was good and the beans and rice are always so good and I got a cheese enchilada on the side that I intended to sort of graze over and take half of it home with me. In the end there wasn't anything left to box up and I had to take a nap in the front seat of my truck before I could drive another hour and a half to get home.",5 star rating,Jude E.

10/22/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Some of the worst mexican food I've ever had, if not THE worst. The place used to be different, I'm sure of that.  The Agaves burrito is  honestly gross.  It is drenched in a poor quality chipotle mayo sauce that makes you want to gag. The inside of the burrito was just globbs of runny avocado ( not fresh ), some fish, and cheese. This place is not authentic like many other spots in the area. They've lost their way and it shows.  I haven't reviewed anything in years but this place is worth warning about.",1 star rating,Matthew E.

8/23/2019,"Henderson, NV",Stopped in for lunch based on the yelp rating. Extremely disappointed. Food was overpriced and frankly no different than Mexican food you can get anywhere.

12/4/2016,"Camarillo, CA",First of all I have to say that this is the hands-down best Mexican food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I live in California and there is a lot of good Mexican food here--some more authentic than others--but good. I had the Pollo Asado which was really good.  My wife however ordered the Salmon Tropical and wow!I typically never order fish from a restaurant ever but after a taste of that I have officially changed my mind and know exactly what I will get next time.Do yourself a favor and eat here.

3/12/2019,"Encinitas, CA",I love Los Agaves.  I love the mix between authentic Mexican flavors and more Americanized Mexican dishes.  Both are very good!  I often order the steak picado which always impresses me with the quality and tenderness of the steak.  This place is always busy but luckily it is on Doordash which is perfect for those college dinners when you cannot be bothered to actually leave your room.  One of my favorites at Los Agaves is the Molcajete -- it is basically a thick sauce full of meat and veggies.  It is super delicious and definitely something worth trying if you have never tried it before!,5 star rating,John Y.
11/11/2014,"Burbank, CA","The food here is fantastic and there is plenty of documentation in other reviews.My only gripe is that the restaurant clusters too many things in one area, causing a crowd and frankly, an annoyance, to do the following:1. Get drinks2. Get salsa3. Use the bathrooms4. Get utensilsAll four of these things are in the same small space to the right of the cashier/order area, which results in a large cluster of people in a narrow area.Los Agaves  - please either have table service or move some of these areas around. It's also surprising that you have single use bathrooms for so large a restaurant.",4 star rating,Sarah K.
8/5/2016,"San Jose, CA","We tried this place out based on the reviews and it did not disappoint!Atmosphere was very eclectic and energetic. Loves it! Only down side was seating there weren't too many table but the up side was staff would help seat you and if a table was for 5 and you were a part of 2, they'd seat you with another pair. I thought this was helpful because walking in and seeing the long line and packed dining area is a little scary. Not to worry, they told us to order first and they'd help us find a table. It worked! They have it down to a science! Food! Everything was flavorful and fresh!Chimichanga- it was deep fried perfectly. It wasn't too oily or over fried. The beef was marinated well and very tasteful. And the cheese!!! So gooey and delicious! Loved every bite.  Chicken sope- very flavorful as well except the sauce was really watery. So it didn't look too appealing but it was delicious. Guacamole- I have to say this is a must! It was SOOO fresh! And garlicky!!! Lol. It had huge chunks of avocado! It wasn't mixed with a tone of tomato either, which I prefer! And the chips came out fresh as soon as our basket was empty, an employee offered more. Great hospitality!Overall, I would come back. I appreciate that food is served on REAL plates and silverware. Makes for great dine-in without actually having to feel like you're at a sit down restaurant. Ambiance is definitely casual. The funny thing is there was a line out the door as well for La Super-Rica but I do not regret coming into Los Agavos instead!",4 star rating,Debbie Rae N.

8/8/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","First Off- Good food.I must admit I prefer a more traditional regional style Mexican cuisine vs. the creative but very tasty food offered at Los Agaves- But on the other hand the innovation of cuisine and it's unique menu items are some of what makes this place special. I appreciate dishes like the seafood enchiladas with chipotle cream sauce paired with a green salad dressed in a complimenting balsamic redux and a subtle nuance of vanilla (according to my tastebuds). One star off because the ordering situation really lacked in many ways. You order up front and its a mess of people ducking and dodging one another to score a table. The salsas- while delicious, are not maintained frequently enough and disorderly for my taste. In my opinion, the lack of a table side server reduced the overall dining experience of an otherwise nice meal .",4 star rating,Vanessa R.
5/11/2016,"Sacramento, CA","My favorite Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara!  I came to this joint about a few times now and was never disappointed when it was time to bail out.The salsa bar is bomb, the portion sizes are above average, and the service is pretty fast.It seems as if you can't go wrong with anything you order.  This time, I went with the Agaves Enchiladas (halibut, shrimp, and cheese rolled up in two joints with a side of rice and salad).The rice was flavorful and the seafood was fresh.  The chipotle sauce on the enchiladas was a little too heavy for me (too much mayo), but the tasty salad with the mango dressing made up for it since it was really refreshing.If you're craving Mexican food and happen to be in the area, I recommend waiting in that long ass line.  It moves quick and I am sure you will leave happy even though you just gained a few pounds.",5 star rating,Daren L.

Some how some chips will end up on your table and you can enjoy them with your salsa. The entrees here are gigantic and really tasty. They don't skimp. My favorite was their rice. So good.

Not only that, we had chips to keep our mouths busy while waiting.Burrito mojado - they don't skimp out on the meat at all! This value packed, flavorful burritos can compete with the sizeable San Diego California burritos any day.Agave Burrito - the seafood is super fresh and the blend of sauce, rice, and bean is just scrumptious! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water again.The parking lot is very small and the spots are tiny if your car is plus size. There's plenty of street parking but you might have to go a block or two away. Los Agaves is a great find and no wonder it's easily the local's favorite.

On the other hand, my sister choked on a fish bone that was in her fish tacos. She couldn't breathe and my parents told the manager(?).

Recently ordered the molcajete with arrachera (steak) it was delicious! This big smoldering molcajete filled with the most tender and juicy pieces of meat you've ever had sitting in the tastiest tomato based sauce and melted cheese, Slices of avocado, little green onion heads, nopalitos, and chorizo. Not a big fan of their chorizo but that did not hinder the taste of all the other components. My only problem with this dish is that it needs to come with a side of rice and beans, but you can just order that and you're all set. House made tortillas add the finishing touches to a masterpiece of a dish!Went in on a Sunday, lines were not too bad and was very easy to find a table!",5 star rating,Gloria E.

The foods price was decent approximately $10-15 bucks per dish. Drinks were delicious as well. Seating is a bit difficult since it's packed and gets even more packed every now and then.

5/28/2014,"Plano, TX","We stopped by here during Memorial day weekend, and it was one of the highlights of the entire trip.  I'm definitely going to come back here on our next weekend trip to Santa Barbara.The place is one of those ""order up front and they bring the food to you"" types.  They have a nice extensive salsa bar with a lot of types that I've never had before.  My favorite was the avocado pepper one.  All orders come with complimentary chipsWe basically looked at the Yelp reviews and asked the guy at the counter what would be best and ended up ordering the Land and Sea Molcajete and the Halibut and Shrimp Enchiladas with a mango cream sauce.  OMG.  I think I died and went to foodie heaven!!+ Land and Sea Molcajete - What is this?  Well we didn't know when we ordered it but it's basically a mish mash of tomato sauce with meat, fish, shrimp, avocado, onion, pepper, and chorizo in a giant grinding bowl. The mocaljete also comes with 4 fresh warm tortillas and you just basically scoop it out onto the tortillas and chips.  It's got a nice spicy tang and I'd recommend it as it's unique.+ Halibut and Shrimp Enchiladas - This was my favorite.  The enchiladas were filled to the brim with halibut and shrimp, and that cream sauce ... oh man ... so freaking good!!  It was tangy, creamy, and a little bit spicy.  I could eat tons of this if it were local.We went at an off time so there wasn't much of a line and we were able to find a seat pretty easily.  Can't say how it is normally, but I'm making sure to make Los Agaves one of my stops the next time I'm in Santa Barbara as it was the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in a long time.",5 star rating,David L.

6/30/2018,"Santa Maria, CA","I was very excited to try this place after many people have told me so many great things. After viewing the menu, I decided to go with a plain beef taco with rice and beans on the side. I let the order taker know of my allergy to onions. He then let me know that pretty much everything has onions in it, including the marinated meats. I then went for just a salad with shrimp(he said the shrimp was not marinated in onion) and he also put an allergy to onions on my salad.Well when the salad came out, there was a piece of onion in it. I kindly told the server there was onion in it. She came back to the table and said ""they said they didn't put any onions it's probably just one piece."" I'm sure it might have been one piece but that's enough to give me an allergic reaction. Almost making me feel as if this was a preference and not a food hypersensitivity. I asked for a new one, hoping they would take better caution. Some time came, a new one came out and sure enough.. more onions! (See attached photo, there were more through out the salad)I am very disappointed in this place. It is very popular but unaccommodating. If you have a food allergy, BE AWARE.

Boy, that was my favorite. I'd prolly order it as a entree for something light. Taco meat was made perfectly BC it wasn't dry it was tender. Chilli renello with el pastor. It was a huge chilli & good quality cheese. The taste was full of flavor & fresh. It's a causal but elegant place.

3/31/2018,"San Rafael, CA",The best Mexican food i have eaten in a long time. We choose this for our lunch spot during spring break and almost all of what we had was scored 10/10. My 8 year old thought the servings were large! But the presentation and the quality was simply the best! I loved how the servers all made sure there were fresh flowers on each table for lunch. A little detail but defines the restaurant! Mango margheritas were the best!,5 star rating,reva r.
3/19/2016,"San Francisco, CA",I usually do not like Mexican food but this restaurant is so good! We got a Seafood Molcajete and Chile En Nogada. The Molcajete is very tasteful and every detail is well taken care of. Chile En Nogada is very refreshing and functions more like as dessert to me. Totally worth it. Beautiful meal!,5 star rating,Stella D.

5/22/2016,"San Diego, CA","I did not find anything bad with Los Agaves! The place has a nice, rustic and homey feel to it. The complimentary chips were tasty and not overly salted. The salsa bar had a variety of salsas and toppings that were delicious. Some are decently spicy so beware. I got the Agaves Burrito and it was amazing!! The sauce poured on top complimented the fish and seasoning well. The lettuce provided a nice crunchy element to the dish. The guacamole was the silent star of the dish I think. It combines everything well and just made everything right. The burrito came out around five minutes after I ordered it l, which is a plus for me.",5 star rating,Ash S.

10/11/2015,"Joshua Tree, CA","The mahi-mahi with cilantro (pictured) was good, nothing amazing, but definitely good, while the guacamole was creamy, flavorful and delicious. The chips are good, thin and crispy. Good salsa bar. Huge portions. Very busy place with long lines.",4 star rating,Ken L.
5/4/2016,"Chicago, IL","This place is awesome. Mexican food that's fast casual but high quality? I'd drive back to Santa Barbara just to have dinner here again!The salsa bar, while a little cut-throat, is pretty cool. There are about 10 different salsas you can scoop into ketchup-size cups to take with your free chips. I didn't find one I was super in love with, but that's probably because five people were elbowing me out of the way as soon as I got front and center. The food itself was probably the best Mexicanish food I've had. It's not hole-in-the-wall, so it's not the same authenticity. But for what it is, I loved it. The green enchiladas were really good, and my boyfriend loved his nachos, although there were so many they got soggy quickly in the car. Los Agaves, I may live in LA, but I'll be back soon! Next time, I'll dine-in to fully take advantage of the salsa bar and (hopefully) eat my food before it gets soggy.",5 star rating,Kate L.
11/20/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I really enjoy the salsa bar at this place. Something for everyone. I ordered the Chile Relleno which never disappoints, nor does the rice and beans. I will warn you that if you are ordering online, it sends you directly to the Restaurant Connection which adds to the bill. We had always planned to carry out and not have it delivered but missed the ""middle man"" so RC made money on it but FAILED to notify Los Agaves of our order so we ended up waiting a bit and personally were frustrated that we picked it up but RC made a cut. Live and learn! Call the restaurant directly for efficiency. Great food.",5 star rating,Kelley C.
9/18/2016,"Irvine, CA","After touring Santa Barbara Mission we were in the mood for Mexican  food and boy were we happy after going to Los Agaves. You place your order with the cashier and take your number stand to an open table. You will self serve your own fountain drinks, eating utensils and salsas of various heat levels but there are some Mexican soft drinks and beverages behind the counter too.  My horchata was awesome, I can vouch for the Pescado Veracruzano and the Flautitas as being delish!!!Portions were generous, prices were modest.",5 star rating,Pauline T.
12/26/2018,"Santa Clara, CA",Took over an hour to prepare the food. Half hour after the placing the orders for 2 burritos and tacos I followed up and it turned out they forgot what was the order. They asked for the entire order again. 15 mins after that I asked again and they said it's going to take some more time. 3 people came to ask our order again after that and after that they realized that it's a to-go order and we are not dinning in. We wasted an entire hour to get our food.,1 star rating,Vivek T.

3/23/2019,"Montebello, CA",Prices are good and the service is fast - but the food was very disappointing. It lacks flavor. We ordered the Chile rellenos & steak picadillo. The Chile's were TOUGH even with a knife and fork. Rice was good.,2 star rating,Kimmy S.
7/29/2015,"Portland, ME","This place is EVERYTHING. Came here for lunch, and legit wanted it again for dinner. It was that good.Staff is super, super friendly, and the managers came and checked in with every table. Complimentary chips and salsa (at the salsa bar). Salsa bar had so much variety of salsas and extra condiments. My favorite was the avacado salsa. It was so smooth, and was very intense and spicy. What we ordered:- Tacos Baja: 2 fish or 2 shrimp tacos. I asked for 1 of each. If you are a fan of fish tacos... THIS IS IT. Upon my first bite, I was in heaven. Both the fish and shrimp tacos were amazing. They are beer battered, so very crunchy. At the same time, really juicy. I still stare at my IG post of these tacos sometimes (pictured). - Agaves Enchiladas: Fresh halibut and shrimp enchiladas. They are NOT battered. Drenched in chipotle  sauce. It was really, really good. - Halibut Ceviche: really big portion; I didn't even get to try it bc I was busy devouring my fish and shrimp tacos, lol. But my dad and brother said it was good amd really fresh. They give an entire avacado, which is always nice since I love avacado.- Agaves margarita was really tasty! One thing I didn't enjoy, was that the door was left open so there were some flies around the seating area near the huge windows.",5 star rating,Ashley W.

7/4/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I've been day-tripping to Santa Barbara for over 20 years. My routine has been relatively the same each time...visit the farmers market, walk the pier, lunch at Super Rica, ending with a leisurely drive around town.   During my most recent visit I thought about changing it up and trying Los Agaves (just a block from my beloved Super Rica).   We decided to try the breakfast menu and were initially disappointed they didn't have any pozole.  Eventually we settled on the chilaquiles and stuffed poblano.Service was friendly and efficient. We liked the self serve salsa bar (lots of tasty choices).  Our food arrived relatively fast accompanied with a basket of tortilla chips.  Portions are huge and overall our breakfast was tasty.  The salsa bar won us over with the guacamole sauce and salsa fresca.  Although we were the only patrons for about 15 min, soon the place was packed with what seemed like regulars.  I'm glad we tried something new.  Sometimes change can be good!",4 star rating,Kelly K.
9/28/2019,"Fullerton, CA","SoCal native. This may be the best Mexican food I've ever had. Huge portions, decent price, friendly staff.

2/9/2019,"Milpas, Santa Barbara, CA",Disappointing dinner tonight. Haven't been to Los agaves in a few years and tonight's food made it a regrettable choice. The positives--hubby and I loved the margaritas and of course the chips and salsa bar. The wait and line move quickly which is nice. Hubby said the ceviche was delicious. The rest of the experience was negative. My chicken taco and enchilada both had terribly dry chicken. Husbands steak was over cooked. He asked for medium rare and got well done. I wish we had just gone to Rudy's tacos. At least that place is good and consistent. Service was meh. Friendly at the order counter but I was waving my arms like an air traffic controller to get their attention at the table.,2 star rating,Michelle S.
7/22/2013,"San Francisco, CA","Came here with a group of 9 before heading out to State Street for the night. You order at the counter and then find a seat, so they don't take reservations, but they were nice enough to gather several tables together for our large party.Food: I ordered the Los Agaves salad with chicken and dressing on the side. The chicken was delicious! Flavorful and very moist! Probably one of the best places for chicken ever. The salad itself was also tasty! They gave us chips and they have a pretty good salsa bar. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food also. Drinks: A good majority of the girls ordered margaritas to go with their meal, but we ended up with a couple extra being delivered to our table! Oh well, the more the merrier! Apparently they make them right out there, fresh each time and they are tasty!Would I return?

7/1/2018,"Buena Park, CA","Probably one of the best testing Mexican food that I ever had. Overwhelming Yelp reviews brought us here while my wife and I were visiting Santa Barbara. When we got there we were confused with the place being fast-food or a seat in restaurant. Don't let this get to you if you are in for amazing Mexican food. We ordered two plates (2-item combination and garden burrito). Both were amazingly delicious. Though bit expensive for a fast-food/restaurant, quantity was for more like 4+people. Chips were fresh and warm. Salsa bar was amazing. Our favorite was the green salsa..yum yum!!! Overall a must go to place if you crave for yummy Mexican food.",5 star rating,Vishal B.

The restaurant is extremely busy but the line moves quickly and you are served in a timely manner. You will definitely drive right by this restaurant on the corner of the street so pay close attention when approaching the intersection. What can I say about this food? So, so flavorful! The enchiladas with red sauce blew my mind, crispy taco shells were nice and crunchy and portion sizes were huge. Did I LOVVVVE the baked beans? Not really, but the rest of the meal was so so good that it didn't matter. The RICE? I would like to eat that everyday! The chips I previously mentioned are served without any salsa but they have a fresh salsa bar with green/red salsa, pico de Gallo, etc, fill your boots on mild, hot varieties! This is a must when traveling through Santa Barbara. I can't wait to go back!!",5 star rating,Camille P.
5/18/2018,"Goleta, CA","This is probably the best mexican food in all of santa barbara. The food is incredible, the service is top of the line, and the dining experience is always very fun! I remember when this place first opened and I didnt think anything could beat Los Arroyos in montecito, however this place does it. The best part about this place is the consistency with the take out orders. They ALWAYS get the orders right and the same cannot be said for other restaurants around town. I think this is one of the more underrated qualities in a restaurant today and this place at ALL of their locations, nails it. Bravo!!",5 star rating,Tim W.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were excellent. Good size portion of seasoned chicken along with three tortillas and a ton of veggies. Everything tasted fresh and was very good. Also tried a sample of a friend's nachos and they were very good as well. Prices were reasonable given the portion size. Service was a bit of a letdown (not overly friendly, forgot to bring out another friend's entree). That's the only thing keeping it from being 5*. The place certainly met the hype.

3/29/2016,"Ventura County, CA","A religious experience. The burritos, the molcajetes, the mole, the a la carte menu, the salsa bar - all amazing. My wife and I discovered this place a year or two ago while enjoying a romantic getaway. The line was out the door and down the sidewalk, but we waited and determined this would become our ""spot"" as we love Santa Barbara.Yesterday, we came back for lunch after a short outing. The line wasn't as long, but it was just as crowded. The bustle of people moving around makes for a loud experience, but it doesn't matter as you're nom, nom, nomming yourself into a trance as you enjoy your meal. There were no left overs. The lines move quickly as does the service of your food. The wait staff is courteous and gladly answers menu questions before you order.Truly authentic flavors that will keep you coming back again and again. I was glad to learn there is a location in Westlake Village. I'm going to gain 30 pounds....",5 star rating,Marcelo B.
1/16/2016,"Redmond, WA",This is probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. I ordered the Los Agaves Enchiladas with the shrimp and halibut. It was cooked perfectly. The salad that came with it with the mango dressing is one of the best salads I have ever had. It was very fresh and the dressing is just so right when it comes to the flavor and the texture. Their rice was also on point! They have the BEST rice among all the places I've tried. I'll definitely be back here the next time I visit Santa Barbara. This is a gem. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's visiting this lovely city.,5 star rating,Gretchen Q.
1/29/2014,"Santa Maria, CA","Yelp never lets me down! Came here in between a day of appointments and only had 90 minutes to lunch. I needed comfort food and they didn't let me down. We got the avocado salsa and what I thought might have been the mild salsa from the chip bar. There are so many to choose from but I didn't want to be greedy. I ordered a chimichanga which I might add was HUGE and came with beans, rice and sour cream and guacamole. The beans were not like most Mexican restaurants but I loved them. The chicken was shredded so finely that there was no chucks. I like it this way best. My husband got the green chili enchiladas and they looked heavenly. His too came with beans and rice. The rice was good. Usually I don't eat the rice or pile it on my sons plate.

1/3/2016,"Oakland, CA","Unfortunately, the just-adequate food combined with the ordering/seating system equals a fail in my book.One lines up to order, then finds a seat to wait for said order. As a party of five, we probably waited in line on Friday night at 5:40 for about 25 minutes just to order. While in line I observed the system and saw that once you've ordered, you can ask one of the servers to help you find a table. So I did that, and we got a table right away. Unfortunately, when our food came, only 4 of 5 people got their food and by the time I could flag down someone to check on the 5th, we were all just about finished. The teen boy let them know he ordered fajitas, but unfortunately didn't tell him which kind, and he wasn't asked, so the server just went and brought him chicken fajitas....he had ordered beef. Teen boy didn't want to wait so just ate it....as we all watched since we were done. They also didn't bring an order of guacamole (we had ordered two separate orders of it and they did bring one). Getting a 2nd drink is also difficult - you can flag someone down and then pay them, apparently, but again, flagging someone down is difficult at best.I did enjoy the ceviche tostada...although at $11.75 I found it super pricey. Teen girl had a chile poblano, hubby had mole enchiladas - can't recall what dad had. They all consistently thought the food tasted just okay. Definitely wouldn't return.",2 star rating,Laurie H.

The shrimp quesadilla we ordered for my toddler son and it was delicious, but spicy for him (great for adults though!).

10/19/2016,"San Diego, CA","This place is delicious!I placed an order to go as I was visiting Santa Barbara on Business. They have the full menu online which made it a breeze to order. The only thing i was not a fan of was parking. They have a tiny parking lot and street parking can be difficult. Since i was just picking up, i ended up parking across the street at the little market. I ordered the enchiladas suizas, an order of guacamole and an Horchata. It was a ton of food! The enchiladas were huge with huge chunks of grilled chicken. And I mean literally grilled chicken, not that shredded chicken you get sometimes. I will say I would have liked the salsa on them to be a little more spicy, it seemed a little plain. BUT, they have a huge salsa bar and since i picked up a few, it was no big deal. The rice and beans were pretty delicious too. The guacamole order was pretty large and they gave me a ton of chips to go with it. Oh, and the service picking up was fast and friendly.I'll definitely come back here on my next business trip.",5 star rating,Mary G.
10/19/2014,"Tallahassee, FL","Maybe the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. We had the ceviche, Los agaves salad and the most unbelievable pork dish. Salad was fresh and good, but was outshined by the other two. The ceviche was fresh, tasty and came in a very generous portion. Lots of tender mahi mahi, pico and other veggies with bright, fresh flavor.I can't remember the name of the pork dish I got - it was a special from the hand written chalkboard and isn't on the menu. Maybe pipin? It featured tender pork that had been marinated with achiote peppers and lime. Fork tender and sooooooooo flavorful. The pork was accompanied by a habanero salsa that had the perfect amount of heat for me, as well as black beans. I made my own tacos with the homemade tortillas that were thicker than any tortilla I've ever had. Perfect consistency and quality for a fat, juicy taco. Awesome!",5 star rating,Jeremy C.

The restaurant was small but the seating system they used seemed to work well. It was also very clean.

The Enchiladas Suizas is #1 on the specials board and #1 in my belly.  There are a couple of pork dishes (can't remember the names) that have always treated me like a queen.  The meat is juicy and so, so tender.  The horchata's pretty tasty too.This is the kind of food that gets me daydreaming.  This is the kind of food that gets me excited.  Los Agaves is my boo.  I love you, boo.",5 star rating,Nakry K.
8/23/2017,"Bethesda, MD","Tasty food! The sauces and all the food we ordered were good. The reason I took two stars off is because of the way the service is set up. You order at the counter and then go wait at the table for your food. It's not a full service restaurant, it's more like a taco shop/restaurant combination. I didn't like that at all!  One person was handling the cash register and bringing out food, it was just strange.  I wish it were either a self serve taco shop or a full service restaurant and priced accordingly.  If I'm paying 18 for a Mexican food plate, I would prefer table service.",3 star rating,Vanessa M.
6/1/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","A lot of Yelpers seem to really love this place. With 4.5 stars and nearly 600 reviews at the time when I checked it out how wrong could they be, right?I had my first taste of this place and I liked it enough to give it another chance. I wasn't wowed but maybe the kitchen was having an off day? Either way, here's my take on this restaurant.Parking is very limited and the restaurant can seat far more than what the lot can accommodate so be prepared to look for street parking. The plus side is the area isn't so crazy with traffic that it would be a hassle like here in Hollywood on Sunset or Melrose. The restaurant itself is very bright and clean. My girlfriend and I had lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was full. I was worried that we may not be able to get a table but that was not a problem. The staff there are very responsive in clearing the tables and making them available almost immediately. Once you get your number after paying, just scope things out. Someone mentioned that they were scolded by the staff for taking a table while their friends were waiting to order and I can totally understand why. This place runs like clockwork and the person who has the number will get the food first and most likely be finished, allowing for another person/group to take the table. If you're holding down a table without an order in the kitchen's queue, you're just going to screw up the ebb and flow of things. The food is tasty and the presentation was tasteful and not thrown together like at a fast food restaurant, however, the dishes we had were lacking in the key ingredients. I had the Agaves Burrito and my girlfriend had the Agaves Enchilada. My burrito seemed to have more lettuce and guacamole than the shrimp and halibut the menu was touting and the enchilada was a lot of cheese with a hint of shrimp and halibut. On the positive side, the various salsa I had from the salsa bar were all delicious and I applied those generously. I love spicy food on the magnitude of ghost pepper spicy and although the salsa won't touch that level, they were spicy enough to show that Los Agaves wasn't going to water things down for the masses. When all is said and done, if you're looking for a nice sit down Mexican restaurant, this is not the place. Although the food is good enough to featured at a nice Mexican restaurant the atmosphere is fast food and I don't see a reason why the owners should change it. All in all, the next time in Santa Barbara I'm going to give Los Agaves another shot if I'm in the mood for Mexican.",3 star rating,Rich O.

6/20/2017,"Pasadena, CA","I should preface this by saying I would give them zero stars if I could. 1. I grew up going to Mexican restaurants in East LA and the food here was OK.2. I should've known this place was questionable when the girl at the counter asked me what kind of meat I wanted on my ceviche tostada. (Hint: Ceviche is only made with seafood). Oh by the way ... they came and told us after we purchased it that they were out of it.3. My husband called to inquire about the wait for a table and the girl who answered said it was a 5-10 minute wait. Yet the place is ""order at the counter"" and you seat yourself. Not sure why she didn't mention that.4. We ordered a kids quesadilla that came out last. How long does it take to make a kids quesadilla? Apparently longer that it takes to make full entrees.5. We reminded three of the staff that we ordered a flan. We finally got tired of waiting and left without it. My daughter asked if we could the place negative stars. I wish we could.We will pass on this place in the future.",1 star rating,Cathie C.

7/19/2015,"Bloomington, IN","Thanks Yelpers for steering us here. If you want a taco dive, go to La Super Rica one block away -- they always seemed to have a line out to the street. Los Agaves is sit-down (after you order at a counter), nice plates, much fancier Mexican food, amazing specials. We loved it. Well, one thing to complain about: the area where you order, get your salsas, get your drinks, and go to the restroom needs to be remodeled! Too many things for too many people in too small a space. But the food -- wow. Fresh Mex -- like if you've been to Taco Mesa in Costa Mesa CA. Everything was delicious. I was so anxious to eat it I didn't pause to take pictures, which is too bad because the presentation is worthy of a much fancier restaurant. So great that we returned twice for more. Even a plain cheese enchilada with red sauce was terrific, but we also had grilled fish tacos, chicken mole, and I can't even remember what else but I so wish there was something even close to this good back home.",5 star rating,Jeremy A.

The rice and beans we're like nothing I've ever had before, I'm Mexican and have eaten my fair share of rice and beans lol but this place blows all that out of the water. The food was just full of flavor down to the salsa and chips! I wanted to fill a cup up with their salsa and take it home... I didn't because I'm not tacky....

The items on the menu have names that were not easy for us to recognize. After ordering, we sat at a table and food was delivered to our table. There was variety of salsa at the condiment bar to grab. I've never seen so many varieties of salsa. Some of them quite spicy.The food was excellent, cooked well, presented nicely and tasted delicious. Will be visiting here again next time we travel to Santa Barbara",4 star rating,Saeideh B.

1/28/2013,"Paris, France","If you're debating between La Super Rica & Los Agaves (like I was), let me break it down for you: you'll pay at least double at Los Agaves for a nice atmosphere and pretty plates. That's it. If that stuff isn't important to you, you'll be perfectly happy eating off paper plates at Super Rica, or anywhere else along Milpas.It was a close call, but we chose Los Agaves for the comfy, clean atmosphere. I was pleased & enchanted by the place up until my food arrived. I ordered the halibut & shrimp enchiladas for $13, fair enough for a seafood-loaded meal. Being the detail-oriented Virgo that I am, I counted 6 shrimp and 1 bite of halibut in my entire plate. The rest? Cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Which would be awesome if I had ordered a cheese enchilada! But I didn't.The dish came with rice and a very luscious salad with sweet mango dressing, which I loved. But still, I couldn't get over the skimpy bits of fish. Also, the menu touted a chipotle sauce, which ended up being a super creamy pink sauce (with chipotle in it, I assume). It was all much heavier than I expected. El chico ordered some nice looking halibut tacos and was perfectly content with his meal. The complimentary chips and salsa bar are also great additions. Bottom line: take your time when you order. Scan the Yelp photos and choose carefully so you know what you're in for. Los Agaves can pride itself on a very cute cantina-style atmosphere, nicely presented food, and the self-serve salsa bar. But if you simply want to get down & dirty with some spicy Mexi-grub, stick with one of the cheap taquerias along Milpas.",3 star rating,Nique F.

1/28/2019,"Mission Viejo, CA","Ordered to-go on Friday night. The Tacos Del Mar are $13.50, not the problem. Unfortunately they were out of the Halibut for the tacos, which was the preferred choice. Salmon was substituted for the halibut. By the way, the market price for halibut is almost twice the price for salmon, so the restaurant was due to profit off of it's substitution. As if that wasn't enough, they charged an additional $3.09 to substitute salmon for halibut. Not the way to run a business to nickel and dime the customer when you make a mistake by not ordering enough halibut to even start a Friday night dinner (or maybe the price of halibut was too expensive to order and maintain costs?) And then charge more for something that costs you less. There should have been a discount if anything, not an upcharge.",1 star rating,D W.

We had the seafood enchiladas (agave enchiladas) with chipolte cream sauce and a  fish taco. They use a bit of mango on some of there fish dishes are sweet but the salsa bar more than fixes that with a spicy selection to match everyone's heat level. Can't wait to get back and see how the mole, molcajete, and lengua is. I have a feeling it will not have  your abuelas flavors but will be every bit as good. The Shoppes in Westlake Village have a real treat coming there way.",5 star rating,Erika P.

9/26/2015,"Newbury Park, CA","Have to remove one star from my review since my last visit there was a disappointing one. I didn't get my food. I was there with my wife and our friend who was visiting from the midwest. It was crowded, we ordered and got our seats. My wife and our friend got their food, and I waited. I understand that the Molcajete takes a while to make, but one after another, I see Molcajete's being served to patrons around the restaurant, and I'm still sitting there without a dish. We finally call someone over and they apologize and of course offer to get the ball rolling, but it was time for us to leave. We were offered a full refund of my meal and a discount on the entire bill. That's nice. We'll still go to this location versus the one in Westlake, but I didn't expect to be disappointed, it was very uncharacteristic, hence only one star gone.",4 star rating,Sal K.
12/9/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Dios mio!! As bold of a statement as this may be coming from me, THIS HAS TO BE SOME OF THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY! Straight up.......We walked in after having some lobster as a ""snack"" a few hours before, and making a few stops for cocktails and beers. At this point, we believed to have a ravenous hunger, although I'm pretty sure we weren't all that hungry. I was overwhelmed by the menu choices, but decided to go with the mar y tierra molcajete, the tampiqueña, and the queso fundido. The Mar y Tierra comes with chicken, shrimp, and steak in delicious tomato sauce, in addition to big slices of avocado. Every spoonful was a different animal, sometimes having up to three delicious animals in my mouth. Yes, this is a good thing. It was absolutely delicious and a generous portion.The wife's tampiqeña plate came with nicely grilled piece of carne asada, refried beans that come in a little taco shell bowl, an enchilada and a taquito. Again, everything tasted amazing, to say the least. The queso fundido...... DAMN. If you don't know what this is, or have never had it, do it. It's totally worth the clogged artery that wil result from eating this.I also ordered a couple of micheladas which were made as a michelada is supposed to be made. They're not on the menu, but you can ask for one. Props to the compa that was making them. They were ON POINT!The service here was also absolutely stellar. The staff automatically make you feel right at home, and each and every one of them will make sure you have what you need. The owners are from Guadalajara, which explains the hospitality and the amazingly delicious food. Gracias por todo!I'm still have troubled getting over how much I like this place, as it has definitely fallen into my top 10 list of restaurants. I'm going to be coming up with excuses pretty damn often to have to drive up to Santa Barbara from now on.....",5 star rating,Gino E.

Enchiladas was also good! Sizzling hot, not too spicy. Definitely a first for me. Here comes the best part. Gotta love the salsa bar and their handmade corn tortilla.

But it actually turned out to be an excellent experience - not only because of the crunchy tacos, enchiladas and delectable, must try quesadilla de flor de calabasa (zucchini flower), but because of the best service I've  experienced recently. Jorge and his fellow server were so considerate to my 87 year old mom. They quickly found a table, seated her and took our order so that she wouldn't have to stand in line.

When it times come to sit down, you won't have the easiest time finding a seat but the staff is really good about knowing who came in before who and will find a seat for you.

With so many authentic Mexican restaurants, good isn't good enough.Before I went to Los Agaves I spent 30 minutes scanning all reviews on Yelp. After seeing Los Agaves had a 4.5 average rating, I knew this was my best bet for great Mexican food.I'm happy to say it did not disappoint. I arrived by Uber, because I brought 4 friends with me, so I didn't have a chance to check out their parking. It seemed like there was ample street parking though.Luckily, we got their early, so we didn't have to wait in a long line. As we were finishing our meal, we noticed the line starting to form outside.The menu is big. They have all the traditional Mexican fare, plus some things you don't see at your average Mexican restaurant. I went for the seafood bowl, which came out in a hot cauldron.  It may have been the best seafood I had during my stay in Santa Barbara. They had some nice beers on tap and in the bottle.

6/7/2015,"Azusa, CA","Enchiladas Guadalajara. I have to say was an amazing dish. Very few places make the red sauce with good flavor and this place did just that. Reason for 4 stars, I have to eat more foods plates before I give it a 5.",4 star rating,Christian D.
5/23/2014,"Charlotte, NC","Los Agaves - Burrito Mojado - Enough Said!Milpas Street is off the beaten path for tourists, which as a native of SB I love!!!However, if you are a tourist & reading this you will find a great many fabulous, Mom & Pop type restaurants when you leave the beauty of State Street. Now don't freak out Milpas can be quite, well, less appealing than the lovelier parts of SB, but don't let that stop you, you will find friendly people & delicious food.I always get the same thing, the Mojado Burrito, so I cannot recommend anything else to you, but if you are driving up the coast, I do suggest trying Los Agaves, tasty food, friendly staff, and your wallet won't take a huge hit as it will if you stick to State Street, Cabrillo Boulevard & The Wharf, haha When in doubt, ask a native where to eat, if you can't tell them apart from the tourists, be safe and ask someone working in a store which are their favorite places to eat, they will no doubt send you to a place a few blocks away from State Street and you may discover a hidden jewel like Los Agaves. :)",4 star rating,Alyssa V.
10/15/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love this place and so does my family; this is one of my Dad's favorites when he is in town. A few weeks ago I had the Chile en Nogada and it was one of the most delicious Mexican dishes I have ever had. Kitchen is clean, staff is in good mood, parking is tight - all good signs!",5 star rating,Llama S.
9/11/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","While visiting SB for the week, I was craving Mexican food and did a search on Yelp. This was the #1 rated place, with over 1,000 reviews. With stats like that, I definitely had to try it. I'm so glad I did! It is a sit-down restaurant, without table service. So, you order &pay at the register, get a #, and wait for your food. It's certainly an efficient method to get everyone in&out without any lingering or waiting for a bill, etc. Despite having a 'fastfood' approach, the food didn't taste like fastfood. The entrees looked exactly like something you'd order from a normal sit-down place on large plates. It was pretty busy/packed with people hovering around waiting to claim your table. Thankfully we found a quiet table near the back door. Highly recommended overall!",5 star rating,Taylor N.
10/14/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA",I love enchiladas and have searched for the best enchiladas verdes in southern California for years.

Great flavors with just a little spice - wonderful!,5 star rating,Kathy S.

Luckily I went with my parents because they ended up getting six or even different plates just so we taste things. Everything we tried was amazing. The ceviche was my favorite! The steak tacos were probably my least favorite but still good. Not a cheap place but the portions are huge! We walked away with way too much food but were happy to try so much.,5 star rating,Mackynzie P.

The point is that the salsa is DELICIOUS. There are about 8 choices, I really loved the one that has a BBQ pepper kind of taste. The food comes FAST. I got the tacos Del mar with grilled shrimp. It was everything you want. Cabbage, shrimp,mango. The BEST rice I have had in my life as a side. And the salad had some sort of sweet dressing which was yummy and sweet. We made this our pit stop driving up to SLO, and it was soooo worth it. When we drive back down to LA, we will be stopping here again. Your belly will be happy after this.

10/21/2012,"Anaheim, CA","I'm sort of madly in love with this place.The Agaves burrito is seriously 8 kinds of wonderful. The rice and salad that came with it are sufficiently packed with enough flavor and deliciousness to slap me in the face for not coming here earlier after being in Santa Barbara for 3 years now. When I first ate this burrito, I found myself almost at the point of tears because it was so good. Everything in that burrito--the shrimp, halibut, onions, red pepper--blended in so perfectly together. Maybe I just have really boring dreams, but this was everything I've ever dreamed about and more.Second time I came here, I tried the burrito mojado, which is pretty satisfying, too. With steak, pinto beans, cheese, guac, and sour cream, it sounds like a pretty standard burrito, but you'd be surprised at easily that can be messed up. I appreciate that it was actually done right. You really can't go wrong with that guac.There's also free chips and a salsa bar. I mean, c'mon. As if I needed another reason to come back.",5 star rating,Connie C.
9/22/2017,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",When the weather is good I suggest you eat outside with a nice beer and the amazing green salsa they have.

10/12/2014,"Burbank, CA","The salsa bar is the best thing they have, the tomatillo/avocado is my favorite. But the chips are pretty terrible. Something needs to change. Either the way they are prepared or cooked, but the chips do not deserve to be topped with the tasty salsas at Los Agaves. Please change the chips! I tried the fish tacos (not a fan...the pineapple cabbage topping is too sweet and there was way too much of it), and the molletes with beans, cheese and chorizos. This was amazing. It comes with guacamole in a tiny shell and the bread is perfectly toasted and delicious. It is on the breakfast menu, so come early!",3 star rating,Shannon M.

We had the shrimp and cheese stuffed poblano chilies and a combo with two beef crispy tacos. Both were excellent, and more than a few people came by our table inquiring about the stuffed chilies. Yes, they were great. Both dinners, plus two glasses of very good local wines came to about $44. I wish I would have remembered the tip I read to order a couple of drinks extra, because the line was out the door when I was ready for another glass.

You come inside, order at the counter, take a seat and wait for your meal while dipping complementary nachos in hot sauces. AWESOME.I came here with a small group so that we had the possibility to try basically everything, tacos, burritos, even the grilled fish and meat written on the chalk board.First thing first, be careful not to order too much, as portions are enormous (hey I'm european, when I saw the size of the burrito I thought it was for two people!). And Then I'd go for fish, as even if the steak is good, the fish is where they get amazing! tacos del mar, burrito del mar, grilled fish, more please!Ah I almost forgot: hot sauces! yes please! one better than the other, the habanero is something I'd kill for!Nothing else to notice, just a bloody delicious place everybody coming to SB should try!",5 star rating,Maurizio A.

8/15/2016,"Artesia, CA","Worthy of 5 stars on my most recent SB trip. I like that it's light, non-greasy Mexican food in a casual but clean ambiance. The agaves enchiladas, which comes with their daily fish (halibut when I went), was good even after 3 years. The plentiful selection of condiments (i.e., cilantro, red onion, yellow onion, jalapeños, limes, and various salsas) really elevate their food. I'm not the biggest fan of their super saucy salad dressing and toppings (i.e., dried cranberries), but I like that it is still lighter than most salads or sides at other Mexican restaurants. All in all, they really have so many options it will be hard to make a decision, but that means that everyone in your party will be pleased. Even my dad who is a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican food, raved about how it was better than any Mexican restaurant he's been to in Orange County. Definitely worth a visit when in SB!",5 star rating,Phoebe C.

7/20/2014,"Corona, CA","Cruising up the coast on our way to SLO we got hungry around the SB area, so I hit up Yelp to see what was around us and came across this place. It had great reviews so we gave it a try. It's like Carl's JR, you order at the counter, take a number, and they bring it to you plus you get your own drinks. Decent atmosphere and vibe, great salsa bar....around 6-8 different flavors!The food was good, not great. I got the shrimp tacos with chipotle slaw and a side salad. The salad dressing was inedible...WAY too sweet! The chipotle slaw was not what I was expecting. I expected a smokey spice flavor, but instead it was too sweet too, however, I dumped some salsa on it to spice that puppy up and it was better! The shrimp were large and good.Hubby got the cilantro mahi mahi special with charred veggies. The veggies were great & I wish I would have received those instead of my salad. They had great flavor and were cooked perfectly. He also really enjoyed his fish. I def. think it was over priced. Two lunch-sized meals in an essentially fast-foodish setting and 2 sodas was $45...that's ridiculous.I wouldn't seek this place out again, but if driving through SB without a particular destination in mind, I might go back!",3 star rating,Katie W.
6/13/2014,"Spokane, WA",One of the most excellent Mexican restaurants in SB. Delicious chicken mole enchilada with beans and rice. Salsa bar is fantastic and water is yummy tasting infused with cucumber or strawberry. Ambiance inside is chill yet fancy. A true gem of the SB Milpas neighborhood.,5 star rating,Paulina A.
3/16/2014,"Colorado Springs, CO","Checked Yelp before leaving Colorado Springs to find a good restaurant in SB. When we arrived people were lined up out the door so we knew it was going to be good.  Not quite what we expected as you order, pay and they bring your food to the table. We talked with manager about how we heard about her place and she apologized that a register was down and the tech never showed. Well, they were so fast that we hardly had time to read the menu and the specials on the wall be for it was our time to order.The food came and it was delicious. Nicely presented and quickly delivered. Now we know why they have so many Best of Santa Barbara awards.BTW, this was about 6:30 on a Sunday night. Agaves goes into my book of regional favorites.",5 star rating,Dennis S.

11/6/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I am still dreaming of this Santa Barbara gem, which dishes out some of the greatest, freshest Mexican food that I've ever tried. The chile relleno was near perfection: fresh pepper, perfect breading, and smothered in spicy sauce that has kept my mouth watering for weeks. It's stuffed with queso fresco, so the cheese is a little softer and gooier than jack cheese, but that just makes it all the more unctuous. And I can't write about the restaurant's magnificence without mentioning the world class salsa bar. Any ONE of those salsas would serve as a fabulous house salsa, but no, they decided to give you a smorgasbord of options. Make sure to try them all- but don't take too much! It's really easy when there are 8 options. Service wasn't the world's greatest, but the hostess was very nice and when my order got somewhat screwed up, they fixed it at no extra cost. I think it's safe to say I'll be making a trip all the way from my house in LA back to SB just for this glory of a Mexican restaurant... I'm not kidding when I say that it's worth the drive.",5 star rating,Amanda C.
12/26/2013,"Las Vegas, NV","1 word:  WHOA.There's really not much else to say here as it's pretty much covered in the rest of the reviews; this place is THE TRUTH.  Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in the US.

9/5/2016,"Whittier, CA","I love the food here, the only draw back is the service is not as great. They need to improve the type of service that the guys in the front provide.

7/11/2016,"Brentwood, CA","Yelp did not let me down on this one. We ate out on on a recent weekend for every meal for three days and while we had some special times, this was the place that we put down as a must go if we return! It is counter service which surprised me at first but they are friendly and efficient. Plus, it saves on tips for wait staff! Every item we had was flavorful and visually very appealing. My plate came with steak and avocado , beans and a chicken enchilada. The enchilada might be the best I have had. The chicken was incredibly flavorful. The steak was cooked right! I wish I lived in Santa Barbara as I would explore the menu to see what other things there were. The salsa bar was tasty. I took a bit of each to try and, even after our meal, I couldn't stop eating to have some of the tomatillo salsa. This place was an unqualified hit and it is NOT in the busy part of town where there is no parking. We found street parking",5 star rating,Ken B.
10/25/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I constantly confuse this place for heaven.Let me just list a few of my favorite things....*~* The service is always so efficient and friendly! Family owned business, and I always see the owners there each time I come in.*~* Salsa bar - so much selection - the pico de gallo and the tomatillo salsas are divine. When you're seated at your table, you get a basket of warm tortilla chips (you can ask for refills as well).*~* LOS AGAVES BURRITO. Holy moly. Halibut, shrimp, cheese, guac all in this burrito dressed in the nectar of the gods: CREAMY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. Dude. This sauce... This sauce.. I dream about it and wish there was an IV of it in me. This burrito comes with a delicious side salad with a sweet mango dressing and the most perfect rice I've ever consumed in my life. I can live off of this meal for the rest of my life if I could. Note: the Agaves Enchilada is the same thing, only in enchilada form- recommend if you're not ridiculously hungry. I always take home leftovers when I get the burrito!I've tried the salmon tacos before, and they were great! Tender chunks of salmon.This place gets very, very busy so finding a table after you order can be a little tricky, but it always works out! They also have a great selection of Mexican beers- Pacifico, Modelo, Corona, etc. A MUST if you are in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Candice K.
10/25/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Great food however the service can lack, especially when they make your order wrong. Never had I had a restaurant tell me, ""no you're wrong.""All that aside, the food's great but could use some better training for some of their employees on what actual customer service is.",4 star rating,Sam B.
10/23/2015,"San Luis Obispo, CA","We'll definitely return to Los Agaves next time we're in Santa Barbara and in the mood for Mexican food. Casual but nice atmosphere; the food is presented in a more gourmet style than your typical Mexican restaurant, also more salsa options. We were greeted by a friendly gentlemen who instructed us to order up front and then to take a seat. Waiter Tony was fantastic, bringing us extra varieties of salsa to try with our tortilla chips. The guacamole was great. The Halibut fish tacos were delicious and came with a side salad of fresh spring greens and mandarin sections along with a wonderful, sweet orange dressing and with a lovely pyramid shaped mound of rice which was seasoned just right. My teen got a big steak burrito which she loved.",5 star rating,Nancy S.

I opted for the huevos con chile verde with a crispy tostada layered with black beans and eggs topped with chunks of pork in a delicious sauce.  Muy bueno!,5 star rating,Chad B.

Their wait staff is extremely busy, but very helpful and  attentive. Everything i've ordered here has been super fresh, and super delicious. Try the combo plate with chicken, chorizo, and cactus.

It's a huge plate full of food.  It was good but it was a lot of food. It should be for how much you're paying.  I also wish they would have more selections with out all the sea food.

Everything about this place is on point from their awesome owners and staff, to the cleanliness, to their salsa bar, to the quick delivery of your food, the prices, and the way your food looks on the plate (always a good photo op if you're into that).

Don't be fooled, the presentation of the food is as if you are in a full service restaurant. Impressed with the salsa of course, halibut, and rice. The corn tortillas were absolutely outstanding.

It is a clean and quaint place with friendly service. We went on a Monday afternoon and it wasn't busy when we were there. You walk up and order like a fast food place but they give you a number and deliver your food to you like a sit down place. They also provide complimentary chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar with several salsas you can try. We had the agaves enchiladas and tampiquena. The agaves enchiladas were filled with a generous amount of shrimp and halibut and the mango garnish and mango dressing salad provided the perfect compliment to the dish. The steak in the tampiquena was cooked perfectly-tender and juicy- with the perfect amount of seasoning. The red enchilada was the best I have ever had at a restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant and I plan to visit again",5 star rating,Elizabeth M.

9/6/2011,"Claremont, CA","My husband and I were around the area and looking for a good place to sit and eat, we drove by the ocean looking but only found mediocre expensive little places. We looked on yelp and found this restaurant with high reviews so we drove by found no parking and left looking fit another place. After driving for an hotter decided to go back. We actually got great parking this time. We walk in and immediately get the hispanic feel, it's cute. To our surprise it's a order here place. Sooo ok we order and wait at our table for it to come, quick service. In less than 15 mins we had everything. Being that the place was busy everything looked neat, clean and delicious. They brought us warm chips and we got up to get our salsas which were spicy but well worth the runny nose. Felt like I was at abuelitas house. The food was not expensive especially for the quality. The portions are good enough to fill a chunky man. My husband and I split a ""earth & sea molcajete"" and a ""agave burrito"" (if im correct) it has shrimp & halibut drenched in chipotle sauce. We got our 4 year old a quesadilla (ask for no salsa) cuz they just put it on. That quesadilla was big! And we got an additional crunchy taco since we didn't know the portion size. Which in the end was wayy too much food and needed a box. I will forever dream about this place. Seriously won't compare to any other Mexican place. Def NOT an El Torito. If you want great service, quality food, and bang for your buck... Than this is the place. I live 2 1/2 hrs away and I am willing to drive out just to get my fix. I'm coming back soon :)PROS: PLACE IS DELICIOUS AND AFFORDABLECONS: NO KIDS MENU!",5 star rating,Irai R.

My husband and I are HUGE Mexican food fans and this might be the best restaurant we have ever been to.Great value for the amount of food you get not to mention unlimited CHIPS AND SALSA.

7/25/2013,"Ladera Ranch, CA","If you are anywhere within 100 miles of this place, you need to eat here! We had chicken mole and the molcajete with chicken.  Both had spectacular flavor. They were out of legs and thighs for the mole, so they gave us boneless chicken breast, which was fine with us (they told us this when we were ordering). We had so much food from the two entrees, we took half home and both had dinner the next day.The salsa bar is the best I've tried.  The two I had were labeled mild and medium, but I'd say they were about the same level of medium spicy, they weren't garlicky like other salsas can be elsewhere. Though they were spicy, you could still taste the underlying flavors. They have ruined me for other salsas, everything else now tastes bland.  After you order and get a number you can sit down and they will bring you chips (NOT before you get your number! No taking seats before the people who have been waiting in line and paid!). The tortillas are fresh, thick, and delicious.  Even the rice and beans had great flavor. The place was packed right up to closing time with people coming in the door and lining up to order at 9:30.I live 3 hours away and I'm trying to think of reasons to drive back just to try more of their food. I wish I knew this restaurant was here all the previous times I've driven through Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Dee G.
3/12/2015,"Beverly Hills, CA","Usually I have low expectations when it comes to Mexican food. When people say ""its great Mexican food"" I think"" its probably awful"". This place proved me wrong. Food has a lot of flavor. Its authenthic Mexican food. Servings are huge. They take care of details. Even the side salad was good and so was the dressing. I wish you didnt have to stand in line to order. They sell beer and they have a small parking lot in the back. This place is a must.",5 star rating,Carmen D.
4/14/2014,"Oakland, CA","My boyfriend and I came to Santa Barbara for the first time (from Oakland) for a long weekend for my birthday and Los Agaves was our first meal upon arrival.  We were happy to enjoy really good food in such a chill environment, especially given all the opulence of Santa Barbara.  We enjoy truly good food in a down to earth environment.Boyfriend had a mix of chicken and beef tacos which were crispy and very tasty.  The guacamole was perfect and we marveled at how a place like this that does such volume can keep a constant supply of incredibly fresh ripe avocados.  It tasted like they made it right before they brought it to the table.I had chicken enchiladas with green sauce which were good - very satisfying but not crazy superb.  My biggest personal test of excellent Mexican is the mole so everywhere I go I try it.  It was really disappointing - just not the savory, rich mix of chocolate and dark chilies I've had a number of times - this version seemed tangy like tamarind.  This might be a very subjective taste, but for me, this fell short.  It would have also been great to have a Margarita, which I was craving (found many excellent ones throughout town during the weekend).I wold totally go there on a regular basis if I lived in the area though.  It was just great on weekday night, fresh, reasonably priced, and a cool vibe with a big mix of people.  Salsa bar was also great!",4 star rating,Deborah H.

6/23/2013,"West Bloomfield Township, MI","Los Agaves has ruined Mexican for me.  Well, not really, but hear me out.  This will be the Mexican food to which all other Mexican food will be compared from here on out.  And I just don't think any Mexican I have after my visit to Los Agaves will be as good.  So basically I'm going to be disappointed with it all.Their food is so fresh and flavorful.  It wasn't greasy.  Even their rice and beans were flavorful and addicting.  See what I mean?  Way different from every other Mexican restaurant you've ever been to.  The ceviche is so good, with a perfect amount of lime and cilantro.  My husband had (and loved) the agave enchiladas.  Even the side of house salad was amazing--fresh mixed greens (not iceberg) with fruit and a delicious sweeter dressing.  I had a sample of crispy taco, enchilada roja, and fish taco.  I tried several of the fresh salsas on each of those items to kick them up a notch.  Wowza they are good but watch out, the salsa with habanero was pretty spicy.  My only complaint is that they didn't offer a wheelbarrow to roll us on out of there.  Sheesh.",5 star rating,Ashley H.

11/29/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","They are usually ""OK"" but not great. This time was even worse. 4 of us ordered food and sat down to wait. 2 orders came after about 25 minutes (1 was wrong). We had to ask 3 times what happened to the rest of our order to 3 different people. Only the third person ever came back to tell us that our orders are gone since they gave them to someone else so we would have to wait a while for our food to be cooked. The Atmosphere is not ""great"" as other reviewers have said. It is LOUD and cramped. The place is all tile so you can barely cary on a conversation at the table unless you want to talk louder than everyone else around you.  Take out at this place is ok but I wont ever go there to eat again.",2 star rating,Patrick E.
6/19/2011,"Agoura Hills, CA","Ah-fakin-mazing, is what came to mind when I stepped into Los Agaves!!!Driving there, and walking to the joint was a different story tho. The person I was with turned to me and said ""what are we in, the barrio of Santa Barbara!?!"" We were definitely not by the beach boyie.Anywho, the place is super cute inside, bright, and clean. The owner, who took our order, was also very nice. If I may add has good taste because there were lots of latin-boy-lookers serving up the food. He's pretty caliente himself. He even came over to our table to check up on us when he got a moment. I ordered a Modelo Especial, and was able to make it up just the way I like it... on ice, lots of squeezed lime, and a touch of salt. You should try it on a hot day, it's pretty darn refreshing.My fav part about the place was the salsa bar. I'm a salsa freak, and it was definitely satisfying.When the food came it was extra pretty :) I ordered the halibut enchiladas, that came with rice a salad that the dressing tasted like an orangesicle that also had real orange in it,  and mango salsa on the enchiladas. SO good! My company got the taco plate with a chicken enchilada on the side. Looked yummy!I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in SB.",5 star rating,Erin B.

If you cant handel hot foods, DONT try the habanero salsa, it set my world on fire and I was sweating for the remainder of the dinner.However the flavor of it was spectacular and I was able to taste my incredibly delicious meal still however, I had an abundance of sour cream and guacamole to reduce the heat in my mouth...Very authentic Mexican food and I highly recommend it!The way you order here is a bit strange and I feel they probably don't get tipped as much as they should because you order first!

5/25/2016,"San Juan Capistrano, CA","My hubby loves Mexican food and he was in heaven during this trip to SB. After lunch at La Super-Rica we hit Los Agaves for dinner. I ordered the Agaves enchiladas based on the server's recommendation and my hubby always order cheese enchiladas (this is his way of comparing each Mexican restaurant on his first visit). They have an awesome salsa bar with a huge variety of salsas.  Their pico de gallo is very good, much better than La Super-Rica. They also give chips while you wait for your food.  The service here is fast. We got our food really quickly for which I am grateful or I would have eaten all the chips. My enchilada had a huge amount of shrimps and fish meat. The flavor is excellent.  I love the salad with mango that came with my order.  My husband loved his cheese enchiladas.  He said it was one of the best he has ever had.  No wonder the line for this place does not get short.  The food is fantastic and the service is fast and friendly.  Like any place in SB parking is pretty hard to find but once you got one you would be happy you came to Los Agaves.",5 star rating,B R.

The salsa bar is stocked with soooo many different salsas. We had the enchilada with fresh fish of the day and shrimp. It was a hearty portion! Comes with rice and salad and they were both a great accompaniment to the dish. We also ordered the fried zucchini dish. I wasn't such a fan of it. It was quite large, we ordered 2 of these, should've only ordered one. My one kid had a chicken tostada salad and she was very pleased. The portion was so large that she couldn't finish it. My other kid ordered rice and black beans and she loved them, especially the creamy black beans.",5 star rating,Maya P.
3/31/2016,"Camarillo, CA",This place does have ok Mexican food but overpriced food for a place where you have to walk up to the counter and order.

My oh my, does this place live up to the enormous expectations. This place is insanely crowded for a reason. Los Agaves provides some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. The fish was perfectly cooked and the (mango?) salsa wasn't overbearing. I also stole a bite (or two...or three) of my girlfriend's quesadilla (she's always a good sharer, but then again, Thor couldn't have finished that amount of food) and was thoroughly impressed. Also, the salsa is awesome (tasty and hot). Service is quick and sharp. Despite the crazy long line, we were given a table within 5 minutes, and provided with chips and salsa. You can't complain with service like that. This place absolutely lived up to its high reviews. Can't wait to go back.",5 star rating,Dustin M.

We were on state street so we had to Lyft about 12 minutes to get there but thought it would be worth it. The menu looked amazing and after debating what we should order, we stood in line to put in the order. When we finally got up to be next in line, we stood there for about 10 minutes. The man at the register was on the phone, then staring at the wall, and was totally just uninterested in us standing there. Multiple managers in dress shirts walked past us and also completely ignored us. Another worker was charging and checking out to go orders and ignored us. When the man finally called us up, I said, ""we've been waiting for ten minutes"" and he had the balls to say ""good timing then"" and gave me a little smirk. I quickly turned to my mom and said ""we're leaving"", as he continued to rudely comment to me, ""most people wait longer."" The place was packed and I'm sure the food was amazing but my mother and I aren't going to be spoken to like that by anyone, and were deeply offended. This young man was not raised right and I really wish I would have gotten his name.

In fact, she stopped us part way through ordering to answer the phone and take someone else's order. It took 40 mins for us to get our food, and we didn't even get our chips until then. It was all mediocre - at best. I got the tostada salad. The beans were luke warm, as was the chicken. Their ""mild"" salsa was *super* spicy. I got the blood orange margarita, and my dude got an agave. They tasted like water and sweet and sour mix. I'm literally not sure if there was any tequila at all. We spent over $40 for 2 mediocre meals, with 2 glasses of sweet and sour mix on ice. Will probably never go again.",2 star rating,Tiffany G.

3/6/2013,"Phoenix, AZ","While on vacation my family and I like to try the good local spots. So we headed over to La Super Rica. We were not impressed. A few days later we decided to try the other Mexican place in SB that had a ton of good reviews on Yelp - Los Agaves. WAY better! Our vacation was back on track (food wise). This place is very popular. We went at around 2 on a Sunday and there was still a line (you order at the counter) and every table was sat. Luckily we managed to snag a spot just as someone was leaving. Even though you order at the counter and seat yourself they still bring you chips like at a full-service restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch.I ordered fish tacos and the boyfriend ordered shrimp tacos so we could each have one of each. The portions were quite large. 2 tacos with a side salad and a side of rice. The rice was really good and the tacos were delish!! Both the fish and the shrimp were awesome. The tortillas were fresh, the breading on the fish wasn't greasy and the sauce that was on the tacos really made them stand out. We left with full bellies and smiling faces. I would definitely go back on my next visit to Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Holly R.

When I first started going to this restaurant they used to have this delicious black bean and corn salsa at the salsa bar (they have a great salsa bar, by the way!). But, they no longer have that corn/bean salsa :( But, the food is always excellent when I go there.

8/27/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Normally when I review a restaurant to voice my concern over their lack of vegetarian options, I'll give them a much lower score than 4 stars...because, hey, I want my voice to be heard and taken seriously, so what better way than to give a noticeably low scored review that you know will be read.  But, what Los Agaves lacks in good veggie options, they make up for in having ONE REALLY GOOD OPTION!! I could go back weekly and I'd order the Rajas con Queso every time, even if they had other options...and I'm a cheese enchilada guy!  Moral of the story...you don't have to be good at everything, just make sure you're AMAZING at a few things.",4 star rating,Matt N.
3/1/2015,"Baltimore, MD","Los Agaves was recommended to us by my boyfriend's co-worker while we were on vacation in Santa Barbara. We are from the east coast and by no means experts on Mexican food, but WOW- this place is amazing. To start, we ordered the guacamole and the Los Agaves Salad to share. The guacamole was fresh and the salad was light- perfect combo as a starter. The salad was big, but I would suggest adding a protein if you want it for your meal. For the entrée, we obviously ordered burritos! I got the Agaves Burrito and my boyfriend ordered the Burrito Mojado with chicken. They were huge! The ingredients were fresh and all paired well together. Before we were even half-way done with our food we agreed that it was the best meal we had eaten all week. We spent about $40 on food and drinks, which I thought was more than reasonable for 2 starters and 2 entrées. The only down-side to Los Agaves was the seating situation. You place your order at the counter and then have to find a place to sit. On a Friday night at 6:30pm it was crowded and we had to awkwardly stand around and wait for a few minutes. Not terrible- just unexpected for newbies. Once seated, however, the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. To sum it up- amazing food with fresh ingredients, and a very friendly and attentive staff. 5 stars for sure and I will recommend to everyone!",5 star rating,Trish M.

They serve complimentary fresh chips and you can choose the salsa of your choice from their salsa bar.  I have never had a bad meal, but my favorite dishes are the tacos del mar, enchiladas, and ensalata vallarta.  Also highly suggested are the nachos, but make sure you are very hungry or have a few friends with you!

12/31/2012,"San Francisco, CA","Favorite sit down Mexican food in Santa Barbara but as usual, being awesome comes with a price: there is ALWAYS a long line and parking is always a bit of a pain. Avoid peak dinner hours and park near Chapala Market.As for food, you really can't go wrong! Some favorites are the Rajas, Sopes and the Alambres. The ceviche is usually really good, but go easy on chips/salsa ahead of the meal because the dish comes loaded with chips!The salsa bar can cause decision fatigue. The only solution I've found is to go often and focus on one salsa per trip.",5 star rating,Sarah S.

Not even gonna lie, their service model tripped me up at first (apparently you order, then you snag a table, which i wasn't expecting from a sit down place), but it was well worth it in the end.Great, smooth, creamy guacamole; huge burritos; amazing rice; friendly atmosphere. Check it out for great Mexican in SB.",4 star rating,Andrew B.

My friends and I had trouble finding a table to sit at after ordering at the register. I ordered the Agave Enchiladas with sauteed shrimp and halibut. Let me just say it was amazing cheesy and saucy goodness. I don't know what they put in their chipotle sauce but it is just the best creamy comfort food you could ever dream of. My friends ordered the regular enchiladas and tacos del mar. They all really enjoyed their entrees as well. The servings are generous so definitely come hungry. Also, just a tip: they have a great salsa bar with a variety of unique salsas to try. I highly recommend the green salsa with avocados, garlic, onions etc. Very spicy aftertaste but worth the burn!",4 star rating,Christina S.
10/1/2013,"Bethesda, MD","I came to Los Agaves twice during a recent trip to Santa Barbara. I can say without exaggeration, that it's probably the best Mexican food I've ever had in the USA. I ordered the fish and shrimp fajitas and to my surprise, the fish was perfectly prepared, just succulent and juicy. I'm saying this even in comparison to the best prepared Chinese style fish. The shrimp portions were huge for the price you're paying and also perfectly sauteed. I also had the enchiladas and the sauce was delectable.

1/3/2019,"Camarillo, CA","I used to go to this restaurant all throughout college and my husband and I frequently go to their new locations in Oxnard and Westlake. Their food is really good. However, the other day we brought in our infant son to this location with some friends that were visiting from out of town. We were so thankful that we found a nice table with a bench so our son could stay sleeping and we could enjoy our meal. This woman came up to me and said that I wasn't allowed to save a table if I hadn't ordered yet. I explained that they were at the front ordering and would be joining me in just a minute. She then had the manager (or owner, not sure) approach me and force me to vacate the table. I was in shock. The other patrons around us were in shock that they forced my baby and I leave our table. She had just ordered herself and actually our food came out before hers! In the process, my son woke up from all the movement and noise. It was terribly upsetting and quite unprofessional. I always loved supporting this restaurant because of the family like atmosphere and great food and it's sad but my family and I will no longer be coming back to any of their locations. We found their response to this woman's unreasonable request to be inappropriate. Other tables thankfully opened up within minutes (as they would of for her as well) but it was too late since the incident woke him up. I just don't understand why they went along with her request...",1 star rating,Ashley S.

The order-takers (you order and pay at the counter) were friendly and gladly explained any menu item to us. All of us were happy with our food - and the plates arrived at table close together, unlike some other reviewers' experiences. Ours was a late-lunch midweek visit, but it was still busy - I might not try this place on a weekend unless I was prepared for a wait. It's good for kids IF there isn't a long wait involved, and good for groups only at less-busy times, when one can be sure of getting a larger table, since they don't do reservations.  We parked in the restaurant's mall parking lot, but there is some on-street parking as well.",5 star rating,Cecily B.

We had a taco bar, enchiladas and salad for the main course and ceviche, chips, salsa and taquitos for appetizers. They might be new to the wedding scene and they did an excellent job; Cassandra from the catering department was lovely to work with and they brought their awesome food and service to our wedding just as they do in their restaurants.

5/1/2013,"San Ramon, CA","Probably the best meal we had in our time in Santa Barbara.  Can't add much more to what hundereds of others have already noted, but the agaves enchiladas and salsa were incredibly tasty.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and tasted very fresh.The prices are certainly above your typical taqueria pricing, but this isn't your typical taqueria.  It's a fresh, creative, and slightly more refined take on the best parts of Mexican food that you know and love.",4 star rating,Philip N.

The food is very good, however, you have to wait in line ( there's always a line) then you order, the you find a table. Mind you this place is very busy so good luck. You will be rushed. It's a shame that they don't have waiters take your order, it would make for a better experience. I'm just not a fan of this model.",3 star rating,nando m.

We had high expectations based on the great reviews but were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD AS WELL AS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Staff is rude!! Non spanish speakers beware the waiters will disrespect you in spanish assuming that you will not understand them!!As soon as we arrived, everything coming out of the employees mouth was, NO!! For ex: I'd like to order your famous enchiladas suizas, they replied, No we ran out!! I'd like to order your cheese/chicken quesadillas, they replied , No we ran out!! I'd like to order an HORCHATA, they replied, No we ran out!!How do you run out of enchiladas/food?? What kind of restaurant runs out of their famous dish/food?!! The food we did order was made of mystery meat which we couldn't figure out along with their employees!! Our overall experience was horrible!! BEWARE!!!",1 star rating,Chito R.

7/24/2012,"Newport Beach, CA","All I can say is ""AMAZING.""Okay, I lied, I can say more.  Whenever I'm driving up and down the coast, I always make a pit stop in Santa Barbara for lunch.  Using Yelp's advice, I chose Los Agaves as my choice and boy were they right.  In fact, I liked it so much that on my return home, I stopped by again.My wife and I both got something different each time.  The first trip we got the Agaves Burrito and the Chiles Nortenos.  The second trip we got the Tostada Salad and Agaves Enchiladas.  The Agaves Enchiladas and the Agaves Burrito were pretty similar except the burrito used flour tortilla versus the corn tortilla used in the enchiladas.  Both were stuffed with halibut, shrimp and miscellaneous goodies, topped with a chipotle cream sauce.  I am not usually a sauce guy, but this one was pretty damn tasty.  They both came with rice and salad that had a to die for dressing that was a bit creamy, however it was also not too over the top.The Tostada Salad was huge and nearly impossible to finish, especially the fried flour tortilla shell.  We got the chicken that was perfectly cooked.  The beans inside were delicious and tasted so unique.  The avocado inside was great.The Chiles Nortenos were awesome.  Two fire roasted poblano chiles stuffed with shrimp and cheese with their signature chipotle sauce.  It left you craving for more.Also, to make this place even more spectacular, was the free corn tortilla chips and the super fresh, super varietal and super tasty salsa bar.  Seven different salsas to choose from made the meal complete and left me wanting to drive back just for another meal.Fantastic!",5 star rating,Erik W.
6/23/2013,"Rockville, MD","Too crowded for my taste. Food was mediocre, although serving sizes were huge. Two people could easily split a single portion. The zucchini blossom quesadillas were delicious. However, the carne azteca left much to be desired. The steak was not especially flavorful and was pretty tough.The peppers and chorizo were tasty.We ordered to go and it took at least 30 minutes to receive our order while we stood around waiting, in the way of somebody no matter where we stood.Perhaps ordering in to sit-down improves the service (or maybe ordering drinks changes the experience).",2 star rating,Rachel L.
1/28/2013,"San Francisco, CA","Got the enchiladas agaves and thought it wasn't very good. The halibut tastes bland (maybe that's just halibut) and hte sauce was overly creamy and not too chipotle-y. Loved the variety of salsa but their entrees were pretty simple - no Tex Mex flair, hole-in-the-wall flair, just fancier-looking and underwhelming in flavor.",3 star rating,Marilynn L.
6/21/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Best mole and best salsa anywhere.  I don't know about you, but these are the two things I am most interested in.  They have a wide variety of authentic Mexican dishes, modernized dishes, and your typical taco/burrito platter.  Everything we've had we liked.  Yeah, parking and seating can be challenging, the lines can get long around lunch, so what?  The staff is very friendly.Update - opening a new business means less mole.  What used to be half a free range chicken is now just a chicken breast on the bone.  At least now they say it's organic.  I used to make two meals out of it and now I just get one.  I will forgive them for this if they continue expanding.  It also means you won't get the two brother/owners working together anymore.  The lines are still long even with two locations to serve you.",5 star rating,D D.
9/6/2017,"LADERA RANCH, CA","Tried it based on other Yelp reviews.  Loved it.  The salsa bar was awesome with 8 or so different types.  I enjoyed all of them.  The salsa containers were generous in size too.  All the chips you wanted fee of charge.  My wife and I split the 3 item combo.  The green cheese enchilada had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce, with the sauce being just spicy enough.  The beef sope was excellent.  The beef was flavorful and tender.  We also enjoyed the chile relleno.  All for $13.  What a deal.",5 star rating,Eric K.

6/24/2011,"Simi Valley, CA","Wifey and I are in Santa Barbara for our one-year wedding anniversary!  Huzzah!  We used our fellow Yelpers (duh) to scope out the best places to eat in SB.  Los Agaves was the highest rated Mexican food restaurant in all of Santa Barbara, and the third highest restaurant of any kind in all of Santa Barbara.  That's some pretty high praise. SUMMARY:Lots of people clearly love Los Agaves, and if you're flipping through the 200 stellar reviews, mine probably won't even rate notice.  So I'm not saying that everyone else is stupid for liking this place.  They're not.  They're just wrong. ; )  Kidding.  The bottom line is that I didn't care much for it myself, and neither did my wife, and if you're like us, you might not, either.  FOOD:This is the thing.  The food is fine. Nothing special.  Certainly not bad!  But by no means amazing.Here's my challenge: go to Van Nuys, CA, and eat at Salsa and Beer (yelp.com/biz/salsa-and-b…).  Then, go to Pueblo, CO and eat at Jorge's (yelp.com/biz/jorges-somb…).  Finally, make a trip to Santa Fe, NM, and eat at Tomista's (yelp.com/biz/tomasitas-s…).  First off, I can't believe you just did all that on my say-so.  Way to go.  Also, you'll note that you now weigh roughly 6000 pounds and have lost your job (unless you get a lot of vacation time).  BUT you also know now what good Mexican food tastes like - and at this point, if you were to go to Los Agaves, you'd be like, ""well, okay.  This is fine.""  Just like I did.The specifics: chips and salsa were free.  Can't argue with that.  The chips weren't really GOOD chips, e.g., warm, light, crispy, salty... they were just, you know, chips.  The salsa also wasn't really good salsa.  But there were lots of choices of mediocre salsas: there was a red mediocre salsa, and a black mediocre salsa, and a really spicy mediocre salsa.  So variety is nice.Both my wife and I ordered the same thing, which was a rookie mistake.  Whenever you try a new restaurant, you should get a couple of different items.  So there's the disclaimer right there: I'm basing my ""meh"" food review on one item.  That's suspicious.  Maybe there are other things on the menu that would've curled my toes.  Who knows.   But we both got the chicken fajita burrito.  I ate all of mine, because I always do, unless it's absolutely sh!t-sticks - but my wife only ate about half of hers.  The rice was really blah.  The beans were inside the burrito rather than out, so I have a hard time commenting on them.  The fajita components - onions, peppers, chicken - had a nice, charcoal-y flavor to them that I appreciated.  Like I said, it was fine.  About a 5 on a one-to-ten scale.  Maybe a 5.5.SERVICE:I wish I'd really read the other Yelpers' reviews deeper - the way you are, see?  You're so much smarter than I was - because I had the image in my mind of a be-seated, waiter-comes-to-take-your-order type of place.  It's more of a hope-you're-standing-there-when-someone-gets-up-because-otherwise-you're-assed-out-in-the-seat-department kind of place.  Supercrowded, the only available table in the house was a little two-top by the back door (which people kept leaving open when they left, despite the chilly breeze.  Bastards).  We swooped in on it (people were roaming like sharks) and I went up to stand in the long line to order our food.  Some people might find this exciting and charming, but I was just hungry and a little impatient.The food came out in a perfectly reasonable time, and a staff member delivered it.  We were asked twice during our meal if everything was okay.  It mostly was, excpet that there was a silver-dollar-sized piece of plastic wrapping in my burrito.  I didn't remember asking them to add plastic bag to my burrito, so I assume it was an error.  But I didn't complain - it just didn't seem worth it.  I'm not the kind of person who stops eating for something like that - I just pulled it out of my mouth and went on.  But I know that would've been a dealbreaker for some of you.ATMOSPHERE:Twas cute, but loud.FINAL THOUGHTS: With a mild stomachache as I write this, I can only say that this was ""par"" at best, in my opinion (again, based only on chips/salsa and one menu item).  I really think that people who call this the ""Best Mexican"" in the world need to get out more, but they're entitled to their opinion.  Wine-tasting tomorrow will make everything better.  Except maybe my stomachache. ; )",2 star rating,Seth W.

6/13/2011,"Torrance, CA","My wife and I stopped here on our way back to Los Angeles. I had high expectations for Los Agaves considering the fact that it was the best reviewed Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara. When we got there, those expectations grew as I saw the line of people waiting to order. I really wanted to like this place once I saw how hard the staff was working. First off, they were out of chili rellenos so I settled for a chicken enchilada to go with my beef taco. I figured I would give both the chicken and the beef a try. My wife got the same thing as me and ordered a side of tortillas.You wait in line to order, then you are given a number and seated where you wait for the staff to deliver your food, much like some of the good local Mexican restaurants you will find in Los Angeles. The restaurant is loud so don't expect to hold a conversation with anyone at your table.Seating was limited but the staff worked to find us somewhere to sit. The salsas available at the salsa bar ranged from extremely weak to pretty hot which was good. They were also very flavorful. The chips on the other hand tasted like they came out of a bag.Breaking down my plate, the beans were not good at all. Their color was odd and they did not have much taste. The rice was good, but I am not picky when it comes to rice. I'll like any rice that is not too dry or overcooked. The sauce on the enchilada was ok. Nothing special. The chicken within the enchilada and the beef within the taco had no flavor at all. They were extremely disappointing. I had to pour some of the salsa all over everything to give it a little flavor.The tortillas are just ok. They taste store bought so if you are expecting some good authentic tasting tortillas, you will be disappointed.Pros:Good salsa selection.Friendly and hard working staff.Food is quickly delivered.Cons:Lacks solid flavor.You can probably find just as good a meal at some chain restaurants.Loud.Crowded.Overpriced for what you get.After we finished our meal, I reminded my wife that this was the best reviewed Mexican restaurant in in Santa Barbara. She said exactly what I was thinking ... ""I feel bad for Santa Barbara.""",2 star rating,David B.

We ordered, they provided chips and our entrees came in about 10 mins.  Overall, it was a good meal and under $15 bucks each.",3 star rating,Ella B.

Too bad they close at 9pm weekdays; 10pm would be better, as they had plenty of latecomers midweek. You'd have to go back dozens of times to sample everything but seems it wd be hard to go wrong--first time there we just asked at the register for recommendations, just wanted something spicy, were very happy with fish Veracruz-style & ""land & sea"" meat-veg mix that was delicious, ample even w/out the rice, fresh chips & delicious hot tortillas (normally I don't even eat the tortillas, but these were more like ones I'd had in Mexico)!

5/21/2011,"Riverside, CA","What can I say? This place is amazing! The hubby and I were vacationing in SB for our 4 year wedding anniversary. Mexican food sounded good so of course we hopped on to Yelp to figure out where to go. The reviews did not disappoint and the food exceeded our expectations! When we pulled up at 8:30pm there was a line almost out the door which can only mean one thing, this place is awesome! The line went much quicker than we expected it to. We also didn't think that we'd be able to find a seat with all of the crowd but the staff was very helpful in getting things going and helping the customers find a seat. I ordered the Chile Norteños (2 chiles stuffed with Oaxaca cheese, shrimp and chipotle sauce). It was THE best Mexican food and one of the best meals I've ever had, and trust me we have been to a large variety of restaurants. My hubby ordered the Salmon Tropical and it was also so yummy.I really wanted to try the homemade tortillas (which are delicious) but I forgot to order them so I hopped back in line. When the man, who I think was the owner or the son of the owner, saw me he told me he would just send them over to the table. He didn't charge us for them but we left a tip on the table for them. Although the place was crowded the staff handled everything well and the food was UH-Mazing. I would seriously consider driving 2.5 hours it takes us to get to SB just so we can eat here. So so good!",5 star rating,Alicia D.

Came right at 11 a.m. on a Saturday before heading up to Santa Ynez.  We ordered the Huevos con Chili Verde and the Cochinita Pibil and enjoyed both immensely.   The owner was very kind and helpful and gave us some nice winery recs. The salsa bar is definitely worth mentioning - my favorite was the tomatillo salsa.  Prices are a little high for Mexican food but the presentation, ambiance and quality make it worth it, in my opinion.Would definitely return if I was in the area.",4 star rating,HipGal M.

5/11/2013,"Pasadena, CA","Wow, how have I not reviewed this place yet?  This is the best place for quality Mexican food in Santa Barbara.  I think the website and yelp reviews are a little misleading - I was thinking this place was a little bit more classier/formal.  But it's an order at the counter/take your food to the table/make sure not to step on the tortilla chips on the floor-kind of place.  Everyone gets tortilla chips when they sit down, and you get to go to town with the salsa bar.  They have an avocado one which is soooo good!  I've had a fajita dish and a carne asada-type dish.  Both were great!  You actually get pretty fair ethnic diversity in the customers when you go this restaurant, which is always a good sign - this is a spot that everyone, locals and visitors, want to make sure they go to Los Agaves!  I have to say, I think Julia Child had it wrong on the Mexican food battle in SB.... this beats La Super Rica!",5 star rating,Jenna C.
9/24/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love Los Agaves, but apparently so does everyone else in SB. I've never been there when there isn't a line out the door. But that's a good thing, and tells you a lot about the restaurant. Even while waiting in line, the staff is quick to get a menu in your hand so you can figure out what you want before getting to the counter. And they always work hard to accommodate your party; at least that's been my experience.I love that you still get free chips and salsa, and the salsa selection is amazing! I usually order the Beer Battered Baja Tacos (I'll get 1 shrimp, 1 halibut). Never disappoints. I also love the Mole Enchiladas (because it's hard to find good mole in town).What I love most about Los Agaves is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's just good Mexican food. Period. Be prepared to wait a bit, but be patient because it's worth the wait.",5 star rating,David M. K.

2/2/2011,"Oakland, CA","My experience here contrasts sharply with one I had recently in SF.  Here, I found veggie-friendly Mexican food that was top-notch in quality.  I had the garden burrito and it was outstanding.  A fine selection of salsas, killer guac, rice seasoned to perfection, and an outstanding value for the price for a great Mexican restaurant make this a must-visit if you're in the neighborhood.  I would have to agree with Steve B - it is, indeed, a destination restaurant.  Come with a healthy appetite, and make this one of your stops while you're in SB.There is, by the way, the best (and largest) painting I have ever seen of an agave harvest here.  If I didn't have to get up early in the morning, I would have sampled some of the tequila that is the fruit of such a harvest.  It just added to the ambiance.",5 star rating,Joe B.
7/1/2013,"Walnut Creek, CA","Last week, on a LONG drive down the 101, my wife and I needed a place to stop for lunch. We checked Yelp, and this place looked good.Well? Good is a woefully inadequate word. Amazing, delicious, and extraordinary are much more apt. Add to that a spotless dining room, a fresh salsa bar,  hot chips, and the kindest, most attentive restaurant staff you could hope for, and this place wins on many levels. As soon as you step in the door, you get a big smile and a warm greeting. Some places stand on their laurels and let the food do all the work, but when you're at an establishment that matches their cooking with excellent customer service, you're on to something special.I ordered steak with a side of beans and guacamole. My wife had the chile relleno with chicken. The cut of meat was perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection (no dryness or chewiness), and obviously of very, very high quality. My wife's chile relleno was a work of art and tasted as good as it looked. The real star, though, if you can believe it, was the beans. The BEANS, I tell you! I've never had beans this rich, this flavorful. I don't know how they do it, I really don't, and I know my way around a kitchen. The food was so great we went again only a few days later on our way back up the coast, this time taking a friend. Even though we paid separately, and had different order numbers, the staff did their best to bring our food out together because we sat at the same table.  Even waiters who were busy with other tables still checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed, which demonstrates a real mature understanding of service -- that even when it's not strictly your responsibility, you help when you can. The manager (owner, maybe?) also made sure to check on us. The team mentality of this place really makes them shine. Basically, WE looked good because we picked such a great place to eat. Take someone here, and you'll look good too!",5 star rating,Joseph S.
2/28/2015,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",Best Mexican food anywhere including in Mexico.  This place is absolutely perfect.  It is so good that it is hard to describe.  The flavored and quality of meats are unmatched and I beg the owners to bring this to Los Angeles.  If you are anywhere near this area drop everything and eat here.,5 star rating,Greg P.
5/19/2013,"Aptos, CA","Horrible, terrible, no good tourist trap.Yelp review of 4.5 must have been given by people who have never had authentic Mexican food.The worst Mexican restaurant in my 59 years.Went to this pathetic place largely based on so many good reviews.  Saw molcajete dishes, which is almost unheard of in the Mexican restaurants in the US. There is a beautiful photo of this dish.  I ordered it.  What a disappointment.  First of all, the dish was not served in Molcajete, it was served in a cast iron plate. Something is very fishy.  Wait, the chicken is cut in small pieces.  That is not how Molcajete is presented. You get the sizzling strips of chicken on a very hot Molcajete.  This was pathetic. The sauce was very sour and soupy.  And to add to the horror was, the chicken cubes were reconstituted chicken.   My friend ordered chicken mole. This was also the worst dish you can ever imagine.  A piece of rubbery chicken smothered in mole sauce that made me almost throw up.Conclusion:Yelp reviews are highly unreliable.  Check the BAD reviews first and carefully decide for yourself, taking the bad reviews very seriously.IF YOU WANT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  YOU WILL BE SHOCKINGLY DISAPPOINTED. THIS PLACE IS FOR THE WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS WHOSE TEST BUDS ARE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY THE MAKE BELIEF WORLD THEY LIVE IN.THREE BMWs IN THE PARKING LOT, TWO OF THEM TAKING UP A SPACE AND HALF AND THE THIRD ONE ILLEGALLY PARKED IN HANDICAPPED PARKING SPOT SAYS IT ALL.",1 star rating,Abid K.

12/1/2010,"Brooklyn, NY","Ok, the food was good, but I'm not sure it was so good to warrant the ridiculous crowds.  Maybe cuz it was the day before Thanksgiving and people's families were in town, but sheesh!  It was a total madhouse in there.The ordering situation was weird too.  You wait (for a good while), then you get up to the register and tell them what you want, then you pay, then you wait for a table, then they bring you your food.  So if you want to order something else, you kind of can't.  We wanted to get some rice, and couldn't figure out how that was a possibility.  The service wasn't so good.The salsa bar was cool.The molcahete was interesting.  A hot pot of steamy goo, basically.  And the shrimp burrito (which I liked better) was doused in mayo and filled with iceberg - not quality ingredients, but still good.  Kind of weird Mexican fare, actually.  Definitely not worth the throngs and throngs of people.  But decent prices in a bustling, authentic-looking atmosphere.  I'd go back for assumedly less crazy lunch time.",3 star rating,anni b.

The shrimp and chiles were cooked well and flavorful, and the tortillas seemed handmade. The pyramid of rice was a little hokey, but I enjoyed flattening it. The salad was a bit sweet for my taste (dried cranberries, mango, mandarin slices, and a fruity dressing), but the leaves were all super fresh.

9/13/2008,"Castro Valley, CA","We soaked a little too long in the natural spring water in the tub on the deck of our room at the Paso Robles Inn (but that's another review) so we got to the Santa Barbara airport just in time to pick up friends from Columbus and Dayton, both Ohio.  We're all starving.  ""You guys are visiting, what would you like for lunch?"" we ask.  ""I dunno, something good, you know the town, we don't,"" they wisely say.  ""Well,"" we say, ""there's fish, there's Mexican...""  ""How about Mexican fish?""  OK, I lived in Santa Barbara almost 40 years ago, so nothing I know is still in business.  But the Mexican neighborhood I used to hang in is still Mexican, so I drive up Milpas waiting for the food Muse.  There's Los Agaves, a nice looking place on a corner, so we park and walk in past the kitchen to a clean, well decorated room with a friendly staff and a menu with some unique dishes among the normal fare for this part of town.  Our four lunches were Ceviche, Seafood Enchiladas, Fish Tacos, and Chicken Sopes.  All were excellent!  The ceviche was a generous portion of the freshest marinated shrimp atop a salad; the enchiladas were shrimp and fresh halibut with a delicious chipotle crema sauce.  Tacos had a generous helping of mango salsa; the sopes were really nicely seasoned.  After lunch we find out that they've only been in business for a week, but there was no indication of inexperience or confusion.  The owners, cooks and servers are assured, friendly, thoughtful and attentive.  Price was very reasonable.  I think the four of us ate for about $40.  The next evening, after meeting most all day, we're in the car driving around the mesa on the west side.  ""What'll we have for dinner?""  From the back seat I hear, ""If nobody else is voting I say Los Agaves again.""  There is no objection, so back across town we drive, and dinner is as good as lunch was.  There was another order of the Seafood Enchiladas, and I think the Tacos, and two of us opted for the Poblano Campestre, two large poblanos, roasted peeled, seeded and sutffed with shrimp in crema sauce--Wonderful!  We never got around to ordering the Molcajetes, which I think are a Los Agaves speciality, and that we watched others eating with obvious delight.  This is a fine restaurant.  The food is fresh and fantastic.  The chips are light and fresh, the salsa is complex and refreshing.  When we walked in from the parking lot we passed the kitchen and watched  the cook filet the halibut we were about to eat.  Can it get any fresher?  It's can be tough to know how many stars stars, but I decide based on how good it is combined with what I expected.  The five stars for Los Agaves are honest and well deserved.  It's not near the beach or downtown, and it probably won't get the notice it should.  If you're in SB do yourself a favor and go to Los Agaves, you'll get some of the best Mexican food anywhere, for a very reasonable price, served by folks who could be your good friends.  Don't miss it by milling around with the tourists in the latest hot ($$$) spots on State or at the beach.",5 star rating,George S.

5/29/2011,"West Covina, CA","First off it's not your typical Mexican Restaurant in terms of sitting down then ordering.  Think hamburger joint, stand in line till you get to the register and then place your order and they will give you a number and then go and find a place to sit.Small little restaurant with an even smaller parking lot behind it.  I'm surprised at how busy it gets.  I had the steak burrito with rice and sour cream and guacamole and my wife had the chicken tostada salad.  We also got a side of guacamole to go with our chips and salsa.  They have a salsa bar where you go and get whatever you want and they have a pretty good selection of different salsa's to choose from.  I didn't taste them all but of the three that I did it was very good.  The food arrived quickly and the burrito was great.  Would definitely head back to this place again next time I'm in the area.",4 star rating,Raymond C.

5/15/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Being from the NYC area, we've had a wide variety of Mexican cuisine dining experiences. Being new to SB, we discovered Los Agaves via recommendations from my husband's coworkers, and we're so glad we did. Everything we've ordered, and that's over half the menu, plus specials, has been top quality cuisine. The seafood is bursting fresh, especially the shrimp dishes, and the halibut. The Chiles Norteños are to dye for. The service is very attentive - the manager floats around pleasantly refilling sodas for you. The salsa bar is superb - love the light green cilantro salsa! The wait, even when there's a line out the door, is never uncomfortably long - waitstaff pass out snacks sometimes while we wait. The prices are very reasonable for SB. We love this place.",5 star rating,Averno V.

Thought it was very tasty, there could of been a bit more fish but overall really enjoyed it, the chipotle sauce it was topped with was my favorite part. The salsa bar was absolutely fantastic!  All of the salsa's were damn good, especially the avocado tomatillo. Defiantly a new go to in SB!",4 star rating,Jonah G.
5/12/2016,"Goleta, CA",Los Agaves has some really great Mexican food. I've found every dish to have a lot of flavor and many dishes even come with a sort of twist to it.

9/21/2013,"Santa Monica, CA",I've been to Los Agaves twice. Once on Milpas and at the new restaurant on De La Vina.  Both times my meal was fantastic.  Wow!  I had the seafood enchiladas and it was so delicious.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the restuarant on De La Vina is way too loud.  I don't know why they didn't design the restaurant to absorb the noise???,4 star rating,Debbie L.
2/1/2014,"Long Beach, CA","YUM!!! This needs to be a chain (one that retains it's quality, of course) because I shouldn't have to go to Santa Barbara when I'm craving this wonderful food!! The Agave Burrito- WOW! Such great flavors, wonderful sauce. Even the little salad has a wonderful mango salsa and tasty dressing. The Chile Pablano Campestre with seafood -YUMMMMY! Only not so great part is the chips. They don't taste homemade. Definitely not as good as I expect to accompany such great entrees.",5 star rating,Jennifer H.
7/12/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Sunday afternoon lunch with friend. I had a hard time deciding what to order as I'd spent some time with the menu on line the night before and was happy to see several things I'd enjoyed during my years en D.F.... enchilada suizas, queso fundido, Tampiquena.......if you ask anybody in the place ""what's good?"" the answer is invariably ""Everything!'   I ordered Tacos del Mar and as much of most of the food plated here, it has a very pretty presentation. I asked them to mix the halibut and the shrimp and they did.  I was disappointed in the amount of halibut in the tacos but what was there was tasty.. Amount of shrimp was fair & tasty... cabbage,mango & dressing were good.  Salsa bar was excellent as usual.  Friend said she enjoyed the Tostada Salad but would probably move on to something else next visit.  When we ordered, the prepared horchata had run out and they prepared some more and brought  my glass to the table.  Not the largest glass of Horchata for $4.00 but one of the best.",4 star rating,Linda K.

7/15/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","Since this place has opened it's become my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I'm a fan of Los Arroyos and Carlito's isn't bad either but this place takes cake, or flan. It's cheaper than both, the quality is just as good, and the food has more of an authentic feel similiar to Superica. Large portions will kill a diet or will be a welcome break from one. Enchiladas and burritos are great but the highlight of the menu is the molcajete.  I've never had anything like it. It's like a soupier fajita. Very original and very good. If you're into salsa there are plenty of choices.",5 star rating,Ron B.
3/20/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I used to go there quite a bit, but it's just too much to deal with.  Two of the servers basically YELLED at my boyfriend for daring to sit at a table as I was walking over with our number.  The food here is ok but definitely not worth dealing with their attitude, especially considering all the other great options in town.  I'd rather go to Super Rica.  At least their food is the real deal.

4/19/2016,"Napa, CA",Very disappointed with this place. After reading reviews I decided to give this place a shot with my family while on vacation. Should have never gone. The customer service was bad. After ordering our food when you first walk in I ordered two beers from what they have on tap. One of the beers was nothing but foam so I asked the guy at the register who poured it if he could dump out the foam and fill it with beer. He rolled his eyes at me and did it very annoyed. I'm sure if I wasn't standing there he would have spit in it. On to the food.... The burritos were OK I guess. Nothing special. I could have made them better. My husband ordered a molcajete and they brought it out boiling hot.... Literally. It was boiling as they brought it out. Even after letting it cool down it burned his entire mouth. He had blisters all in his tongue and 3 days later he's still in discomfort. I must say the best thing I ate there were the side of beans we ordered for our little one. Wouldn't recommend this place.,1 star rating,Sylvia T.

6/7/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","I have eaten at the Goleta location three times. The first time I got the Chili Verde burrito and it was very good. Nice meaty chunks of pork chili verde wrapped in a flour tortilla with pinto beans. The second time I got the same Chili Verde Burrito, but there were big hunks of fat and gristle on the pork. The third time I got the Enchiladas Guadalajara with shredded beef, the taste was very good except for the fact that half, yes that is 50% of the ""meat"" in the enchiladas was fat and gristle. No exaggeration here. Before I left I pointed this out to one of the girls working there and showed her my plate with the bit pile of fat and gristle that was proof of my claim, she just said ""Oh, okay"". So I have not been back to Los Agaves, nor do I plan to. I just can't see paying that kind of money for hunks of fat and gristle.",2 star rating,Dianne W.

1/13/2013,"Carpinteria, CA","Hands down, the BEST Mexican food in Santa Barbara. I'll break it down:FOOD:The food is absolutely delicious! I have tried a huge variety of things on the menu, and have never once been less than impressed. Ingredients are top-quality, very noticeably fresh, and prepared and presented with care. The flavors are amazing, and the dishes are very authentic (my family is Mexican, so I'm qualified to say this!). The food is definitely a step up from most places in town- definitely not a shabby taco cantina. I'm addicted to this place... it's the first place I think of when I want to eat out!SERVICE:The service is great, considering how crazy busy it gets. You order up at the front, then the servers bring the food to your table. Over the years, I can tell you they've definitely gotten the system down! The service is really fast, even when the place is packed to the brim. The employees are always super friendly and helpful, and the owner is always out taking orders, and is super friendly and personable. When it's not very busy, he even comes around and makes light conversation, making sure we're enjoying our food. A huge plus!ATMOSPHERE:Yes, this place gets busy. It can get a little bit loud at peak hours, but they really damped the acoustics when they remodeled, and it's really not bad anymore (it used to be hard to talk when it was busy). The fact that this place gets busy is a testament to how amazing it is, and I very rarely have to wait for seating. At most, a few minutes.Overall, 5 stars... just love this place!!! Breakfast is served on the weekends, and the specials change often.. It's always so hard to decide what to get, because everything is wonderful!",5 star rating,Nick A.

First, I was a little surprised at the almost self-service style -- you have to order at the counter and pay first, then wait to be seated with a number plate. It was Saturday night, so they were very busy and we waited about 20 minutes to get seats. We had the Earth and Sea Molcajete, which many people mentioned on Yelp, and the Los Agaves burrito. They were very delicious with big shrimps and tender halibut. I used to think that Mexican food was smelly, but the dishes we had here was presented beautifully and smelled great! The quality of food is pretty good and the price is inexpensive. I think I will eat Mexican food more often from now on!",4 star rating,Shirly T.

Los Agaves came in the lead.   The entire party of 11 enjoyed their meals, and that was a difficult bunch to unanimously please, with 5 picky young eaters and 6 adults with varying preferences. We all ordered different meal combinations. Some particular standouts were the seafood molcajetes and the chicken mole. I was delighted to hear very few words after the food arrived. Just some munching and nodding/ stuffed mouth humming.  Very little was left on the plates... broken chips, a single grain of rice. It was the best meal we had the entire 3 days.

They have shredded chicken that has tons of flavor without the fatty pieces. My daughter devours the beans and rice every time. You will never go wrong with getting something from the special board. Another friend of ours got a side salad with her meal and I tried one bite and I  keep thinking about it! It had some mango with a sweet mayo dressing. Yum!Every person we take here is blown away. Even when it is super busy some how we always find parking in the back lot or on the street. When it is crazy busy have someone get in line to order and you can stalk the tables out. Lucky for us most SB people are really nice and will tell you if they are almost done! (That would never happen in LA)Oh yea, my husband is weirdly obsessed with the avocado salsa (@salsa bar) he waited for like 15 minutes with his little container in his hand just praying it would get refilled. So you might want to try that salsa out!We went in for my daughters bday last minute & they came out with a candle and sang to her, it was super cute!!!Go check it out! Your Welcome....",5 star rating,Yvonne B.
9/22/2011,"Collierville, TN",This is one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants I've ever eaten at. Great salsa bar. Guacamole is the best on earth. Go with the fish enchilada with the chipotle cream sauce. Warning - you may need a nap after though.,5 star rating,John S.
9/20/2015,"Carpinteria, CA",The BEST authentic Mexican restaurant! If you're ever in Santa Barbara this is the place to go!! The lines may be a bit long but it's worth the wait. (Don't forget to try the salsa bar.),5 star rating,Brenda G.
12/27/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Highly over-rated!!I have been here twice, and both times I have been disappointed. The last time I ordered the ""Molcajete"", which is basically a salty beef stew made from poor quality meat. My father was a butcher, I know about meats!  The meat was tough and was not cooked properly.  The portion was acceptable, but the price $12.25 with no drink is absolutely outrageous for this dish.",1 star rating,Ray T.
8/20/2014,"Westminster, CA","I visited this place at the recommendation of several people and I was not disappointed at all.  The food was really good, the rice was perfect, and the service was outstanding.  We went on the weekday before 5PM and it wasn't crowded at all.  After 5:30 the place started filling up and the parking was pretty bad.",5 star rating,Vince H.
5/25/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA",Agaves Enchiladas are my go to.  Excellent food (unique flavors beyond just the standard Mexican offerings) for a reasonable price.  The owner is always there making sure all are being well taken care of.  Favorite Mexican Restaurant in town.,5 star rating,Jeff B.

3/10/2013,"Honolulu, HI","This is one of Santa Barbara's best restaurants. It's a casual, family setting where you order at the register, find your own seating, and receive a table number. But despite the casual atmosphere, the food and service are at a five star status. The food portions are very generous and the taste is delicious and consistently superb. Overall, Los Agaves is one of, if not THE BEST, Mexican/Hispanic eatery in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,B N.
6/9/2012,"Sacramento, CA",I was very impressed with this place. The chile renello burito was sooo good!! The quality of the beans and rice were also fresh too. I really want to keep coming here! This would probably be my favorite choice here in SB.,4 star rating,Jackie V.
7/11/2009,"Roseville, CA","This was my first visit to Los Agaves and probably not my last. I'll be back to try other items on the menu.I had a carnitas soft taco and a chicken enchilada. The taco was served atop a larger-that-average soft taco tortilla -- about 6 inches in diameter. The cartnitas portion was heaped on the tortilla, so the whole taco ended up being about twice as big as I expected. But the meat was merely OK; kind of dry, actually. And it unexpectedly didn't come with any toppings. I had to make trip to the salsa bar to get some onions, cilantro, and salsa to add to it. Props for the tortilla made on-site, but boo for the low-quality carnitas. Grade: CThe enchilada was a run-of-the-mill item you can get at just about any Mexican restaurant. It was artfully decorated with mole and sour cream sauces. Grade: B-What stole the show at the table was the ""Earth and Sea"" molcajete. Served piping-hot in a lava stone bowl, it had a delicious variety of meats and vegetables: shrimp, beef, avocado, chiles. It's spicy, so watch out if you are spice-adverse! It's enough food for two or three people. You'll need to order extra tortillas because it comes with only three. Grade: AOther companions ordered burritos and quesadillas. They report that the food was good. Not outstanding, but good. The Mexican rice had a bit of a kick to it which I enjoyed but others did not.The restaurant gets crowded at lunch time. When I arrived there were many open tables. Not ten minutes later nearly every seat was filled. You order at the counter, find a table, and the staff brings your food to you. Service was quick and friendly.I think I'd come back to Los Agaves, if only for the molcajete, rice, and a chance to sample other menu items.",3 star rating,Barry B.
7/11/2010,"Bakersfield, CA",So we went here for our anniversary. We loved the food. It was very tasty and authentic. We both had the chicken sopes. They were great! Big portions for the price!       You walk in and are handed a menu and told to sit where you like.  Here is the odd part; they bring you fresh chips but you have to get your own salsa. After perusing the menu you have to get back up and go and order your food and pay. Now I paid with a credit card and it had a spot for the tip.  I was not sure who I was suppost to tip (ME?) They hand you a number. You get your own drinks sit back down and wait.        Now to me if they charged more for the food they could get a waiter and waitress and I would have someone to tip. But in the end the food out weighed everything! I would go again!,4 star rating,Jennifer W.
7/21/2010,"Long Beach, CA","""NUCLEAR SALSA""Going off of fellow yelpers' reviews, we went to this place & were stoked:  my wife had the Ceviche Tostada, & I had the Agaves Burrito (it's stuffed with grilled halibut & shrimp along with guac & the usual burrito suspects & is served wet with a tangy mango sauce), going for the signature named item.Both our dishes were made with fresh ingredients & came up FAST, which is a plus for us as we have twins (a fairly recent development--they'll be one July 24 of this year), & usually have to eat with one hand while holding a kid, all while on the edge of our seat planning ten moves ahead for a hasty exit in case one of our daughters has a meltdown.The salsa bar's badass:  personal fave the ""avocado"" salsa; the habanero's for real, so unless you really want salsa made with the hottest pepper in the world, don't get it as it's fissionable material.Thanks, yelpers, for another truthful review that turned into a solid dining experience.",4 star rating,Mick H.

8/2/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","I don't know how I haven't written a review yet considering I have probably been to this restaurant more than 50 times in the past 5 years. This is my default spot if I want to eat out for lunch or dinner. Now that it has gotten popular it is pretty loud and extremely crowded so I wouldn't come here for a date. Everything on the menu is delicious, arrives quickly and is amply portioned. I do tend to order my favorites over and over though. The Agaves halibut and shrimp burrito is by far the best item on the menu (I would guess one of h most popular too). The fish is fresh and well cooked (not overdone) and paired with mild white cheese, avocado and the burrito is top with a creamy chipotle sauce. Usually not too spicy but once or twice it has been hot enough to surprise me. The Camarones a la Diabla are very flavorful, but much less substantial of a meal even though the shrimp are large. The garden burrito is great for quick grab and go lunch with many more vegetables than are typical in a vegetarian burrito. Stuffed Chile Nortenoes are chewy, creamy, a little spicy....but you might feel like you didn't eat much protein. Overall I would say that there are no bad orders at this place.",5 star rating,Jane H.
8/26/2013,"Ladera Ranch, CA","Truly the best Mexican food I've ever had--the chicken fajitas were moist, fresh and tasty. The corn tortillas are homemade and amazingly fluffy. First yelp review ever, and it is definitely worthy of the high yelp praise.",5 star rating,K A.

4/18/2015,"Aesch, Switzerland","Los Agaves was a let down.  The food was mediocre, and the prices were much higher than they should have been.  My salmon tacos featured two little shriveled pieces of salmon swimming in a sea of torillas.  For $14, I also got a scoop of very salty rice and salad covered with gloopy yellow dressing.  The salsas were quite fresh, but the green salsa was too salty.  Husband and son got Caesar salads and an order of chicken quesadillas.  Their portions were ample, and the quality of the food was reported to be acceptable but not great.  Son said there was too much dressing on the Caesar.  For the high prices, you might expect table service, but you order at a counter.  The restaurant smelled like pungent cleaning fluid, which was not appetizing.  Cool paintings on the walls though.",2 star rating,Cyndy L.

5/12/2014,"Santa Monica, CA","Insanely good fresh-mex. Pretty damn authentic too. A dead give away was that more than half the people eating there were hispanic. Frankly, it felt kinda odd as Los Agaves has the look of a more ""gringo"" kinda place. That was a REALLY good omen. Excellent salsa bar and very reasonable prices considering the huge portions. We shared a chicken/steak fajita combo (intended for one) and with help from the complimentary tortilla chips, it was easily enough food for two. We also saw a couple sitting near us sharing a giant torta which looked amazing. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you semi fast food style, so the entire meal was $15! Once you sit down though, it really feels like a sit down restaurant as the decor is nice and the staff is very attentive, checking on you often (but not too often). Fajitas are a safe thing to order and frankly kinda boring - but they were done to perfection. The lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream were all very fresh. The chicken and beef were nicely seasoned and cooked in onions and peppers to the perfection. The clincher though was the dizzying array of fresh salsas available at the salsa bar. The only minor gripes were the three tortillas weren't even enough for one person, but it was easy enough to ask for more. I suppose I've also had better tortilla chips (probably due to being cooked in lard). Anyway, this easy rates as one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had, especially for the price.",5 star rating,Michael T.

6/25/2015,"Monterey, CA","Fast, professional service.  Visibly fresh food.  My one food gripe: the beef in the wet burrito wasn't shredded or stewed.  It was like cubed pot roast, which I did not enjoy at all.  The enchilada sauce was outstanding, though.  This spot gets RIDICULOUSLY busy, so we definitely felt rushed with a line of a dozen or so patrons right next to our table.  That said, I would give this place another try in the future.",3 star rating,J.K.

We visited this place about 12 times over the past month while on vacation in Santa Barbara.  Everything we ordered was of the highest quality and tasted fabulous! Our favorites being steak tacos, steak fajitas, and the wet burrito.  The steak is just so absolutely tender and juicy. Truly comparable to a fancy steak house. The salsa bar had so many choices and everything was extremely fresh.  As others have said do not freak out about the crowds or not being able to find a seat. I don't know how they do it, but somehow the waitstaff and owner (who was always on hand) find everyone seats before their food comes. Truly the system works somehow: order, get a number, tell waitstaff how many in your party, they find you and seat you, eat chips and drink and voila your food arrives.  No need to worry. Honestly, we really did visit this place 12 times over one month and I would freak out every time thinking we'd never find a spot or that the waitstaff forgot about us, but nope they never did and we were always seated with time to enjoy the chips before the food came out.",5 star rating,Jeanette M.

9/21/2019,"Silicon Valley, CA","The beauty of development and progress. I used to fear when I would notice change, be it in people or circumstances. But (I guess it comes with time) change is looking more beautiful these days.And on that note, there was definitely a change of plans as our time with the parking time limit was running out and the restaurants we walked by expressed that there would be at least a 45 minute wait. So, it was ""good bye Stearns Wharf,"" and ""hello other part of Santa Barbara."" Ugh. These types of changes will still take a getting used to.But, in the end, going to Los Agaves was the better choice. First off, the ordering process was quick (despite the constant ebb and flow of customers). Next, the prices were in the decent range (meaning $16ish was the average price for dishes). Lastly, the food was delicious. Oh and bonus, the deco was tasteful. I especially liked the Frida Kahlo artwork and glass art.Back to the food...-Chile Nortenos: Yum juicy shrimp and lots of cheese...Two big Chiles...what else you want-Tacos Del Mar: LOVE THE homemade chipotle sauce...OMG, as well as the salad dressing (wth...they know what they're doing with their sauces). Otherwise, biased when it comes to juicy shrimp...and a gracious amount of shredded veggies :O-Fajitas Burrito (with steak): pretty basic with the beef and cheese (nothing else really stood out with this one). I mean, the burrito was pretty big.-Complimentary Nachos w/salsa bar: YAH down for anything that's no costLoved the selection of salsas (pretty amazing). The chips were crisp but on the thin side (not a huge deal, but a fan of thicker chips).Service was good?Note that there is parking in the back, but it's limited...especially if someone's being a duck (yes a duck...) and taking up two spaces.",4 star rating,Christine H.

10/14/2014,"Denver, CO","We walked in at a busy time with a big group, and it was handled really well. The staff was quick to push tables together, and the kitchen pushed out 12 entrees seamlessly. Everyone was so gracious about our annoyingly large party, helping find room on the table for all the plates and making sure we had enough tortilla baskets, etc. Speaking of tortillas, they're great, like the rest of the food I tried. The salsa bar was awesome and I kept having pangs of jealousy- as much as I appreciated the burrito I ordered, everyone's else's plates (and the specials chalkboard) made me wish I could eat one of everything. ;-)",5 star rating,Emily M.
6/23/2017,"Scottsdale, AZ","I'm from El Paso so I know good Mexican food and this is place is really good! Authentic just like back home. I ordered the cheese enchiladas.... sooooo good! The staff is friendly too, the guy who took the order had good recommendations and was even a little funny. Over all everyone who worked there was friendly and polite.",5 star rating,Stephanie L.
10/28/2015,"San Jose, CA","I'm from San Jose and I'm so sad this place isn't closer!! Everything I've tried is so amazing. The quality is so good. And even though there is no designated wait staff someone always comes by to check on how you're doing!! I enjoyed the chilaquiles Rojas and my boyfriend had shrimp tacos!! The rice and beans are not an afterthought here, they are so good! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!!",5 star rating,Denise M.
4/10/2017,"Redondo Beach, CA",Great mexican and a big fan of how you go up and order first. Salsa bar is also a plus. Fish tacos are delish and same with the chicken fajitas. I had a lot of left overs to take home :P,5 star rating,Jen C.
1/2/2015,"Seattle, WA","When they're on, they're the best Mexican food in town, and this is a town that is well endowed with Mexican joints. The first time I went here, I came three times in two days, it was that good. But they have problems with being consistent. The tampiquena, which is often just blisteringly good, with meat that you just can't understand how it has so much flavor, is sometimes just bland and OK. The tacos del mar, another one of my favorites, was recently just totally flat and flavorless - actually hard to eat. The service too, was bad that day, and I'm generally not picky about service (waiters work really hard and deal with shitty customers all day - try it yourself before you complain that somebody has ""attitude""). But this was a serious service don't. I ordered a queso fundido for the table, which means small skillet full of sizzling cheese-and-pepper goodness, and three very small corn tortillas with which to eat it. So you use chips, which is great, because Los Agaves has some of the most amazing salsas I've ever tasted. Anyway, we were there near closing, and we didn't get chips. When they came to ask how it was, we said great, we'd like chips please. By the time we left, we'd asked fro chips on five different occasions from three different people, and we didn't get any. Everybody said ""sure thing, I'll be right back with those"". Nobody came back with either chips or news that they weren't making any more.",3 star rating,Eric S.

7/25/2011,"San Diego, CA","This is like a flavor explosion in your mouth. They have a large selection of salsa to choose from and they are all really good. I had three of them and was going back and forth between all of them. For the entree I got one shrimp taco and the cheese enchilada plate. Everything was fantastic. I loved the shrimp taco sauce the best, plus it had a good crunch with all the veggies in it. BTW the shrimp were massive :)I would definitely come back here when I come to Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Lara L.
6/3/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Look, this place rocks.  They have dishes I've never seen at other mexican restaurants and it feels more gourmet and fresh than most other places in it's class.  Sometimes its so busy it's annoying and loud but how can they not be with food this good?The service is great and I've never been disappointed with my food.",5 star rating,Sandy E.

1/23/2011,"West Hills, CA","Santa Barbara and Mexican food. I use to think the only place to go was La Super-Rica. You know the whole Julia Child thing. On top of that i always felt sorry for any of the Mexican restaurants that were nearby, I mean c'mon what are you thinking. Well I have a confession  to make...I was stupid.Los Agaves is some of the best Mexican food i have ever eaten. It is a destination restaurant, and by that I mean it would be worth it to make a trip to Santa Barbara just to eat here.I ordered the Sea & Earth Molcajetes. It was a bowl ful of shrimp, fish, different meats, rice and cheese in a sauce that was perfect in its harmonious flavors. I didn't mind paying for another order of tortilla as these homemade babies were awesome. I will be hard pressed to try something else but I will.The beautiful Dr. B had al pastor huarache. Which had the wonderful earthy flavor that good al pastor has was just so yummy.My daughter had the carnitas huarache, the best we have ever tasted.The salsa bar with at least eight choices were very tasty although the food did not need any help. I wish i was Santa Barbara right now.",5 star rating,Steve B.
4/21/2015,"San Joaquin, CA","This is not only the best Mexican food on the planet, it's the best food period!And if the food and atmosphere wasn't enough... they hire the nicest people.  (like Alex)The Chicken enchiladas are so incredibly good it will almost make you cry tears of happiness.   If you're in Santa Barbara and you missed this place, you missed Santa Barbara!There are three locations in the Santa Barbara area, the Milpas location is the original and my favorite.    All serve the same great food, I just prefer this location best.",5 star rating,Andy P.
1/20/2012,"San Diego, CA","What an excellent, authentic Mexican restaurant!Stopping by Los Agaves for dinner while on a recent visit to Santa Barbara was truly a unique pleasure. Everything here from the delicious food to the exquisite interior decor has the air of quiet excellence, making the place worthy of comparison to the finest establishments a lucky traveler would hope to find south of the border.We started off with guacamole, and were not disappointed. Next came the Agaves Enchiladas with shrimp and halibut - yum, simply amazing!Need I say more? Wholeheartedly recommended to all connoisseurs of quality Mexican cuisine.",5 star rating,Alex D.
3/30/2014,"Fullerton, CA","Damn......absolutely excellent Mexican food.  Busy and hectic when we came (passing through Santa Barbara while on vacation) - we none the less had a really great food experience.  You wait in a long line to order, then fill up on the excellent salsa selection and try to grab a table (not easy.....this place is popular).  Our food arrived about fifteen minutes after ordering, but was worth the wait.  Delicious everything!  I had the chile relleno burrito which was amazing.  Salads, burritos, everything - great!  The salsa bar alone is worth coming here for!",5 star rating,Darren J.
9/25/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","My friend acts like this place is some kind of local secret. I don't like to rain on his parade, but the word is out in a major way. We stopped in for dinner after the movies last night and it was absolutely slammed--so slammed, in fact, that we were lucky just to find a table and make it through the salsa bar without losing a limb or staining our clothing with pico de gallo. That's the other thing, the salsas here are really something special. They have one made out of cactus which is a little bite of heaven.Mostly importantly though, the staff here is phenomenal. Despite the crowds, our dinner arrived blitzschnell, as always. And everyone is always super friendly in a genuine kind of way.",5 star rating,Lisa Z.
3/28/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Very crowded, get here early or later than the dinner rush. Although they are famous for the molcajetes I always get the agaves enchiladas. They are filled with shrimp and fish and are the best thing on the menu! Very casual, average price, good atmosphere.",5 star rating,Nicole B.
