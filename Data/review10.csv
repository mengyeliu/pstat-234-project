2/23/2021,"Goleta, CA","Back for our yearly anniversary visit. Only this time, it was exactly one year to the day since I last ate dinner AT a restaurant. I'm Upping my review to 5 stars because I think the service has been more consistent the last few times we have been here (shout out to Mayra for taking good care of us tonight). Also the food has been more consistently to what I expect, (Etoufee for me and Filetnfor her and split a chocolate souffle for desert and of course all the jalapeño cheddar cornbread muffins I could eat - 8 to be exact) . And I'm just so glad this place wasn't one of the ones we lost due to covid.  Lastly I gotta say I miss the singing and most of all Errol. Hopefully the singing returns when covid is gone, but it will be missing just a little something with out him. Hope he is resting in peace.",5 star rating,Joshua G.
11/5/2020,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA","If you're in the area, want something with flavor, great service and great food do yourself a favor and stop by. The Palace Grill serves a menu filled with authentic Cajun and Creole cuisine of New Orleans and the American South, as well as a wide range of contemporary American grill favorites. Their menu should have something for everyone. Currently due to the Covid times, their menu is a bit more limited, but still has some great choices.  The banana walnut and cheddar corn muffins are a nice start compared to the usual bread and butter, they are served warm with some good butter. The bayou greens salad is good enough to share for two and I really like the dressing on it. Flash fried artichoke hearts (when available) are not too heavy and the buttermilk dressing gives it a nice tang. Out of everything I've had so far I think my favorite is the jambalaya sauce piquante which is so savory and has so much flavor with all of the spices they use. If you're thinking about dessert, you can't skip out on the bread pudding souffle or chocolate souffle, they take a bit of time to cook so order it earlier on; they are indeed worth the wait! The whiskey cream sauces take the soufflé's to another level. Something's I've had over the various times, but not limited to:Cajun Martini - Classic vodka, chilled and marinated with a fresh jalapeño pepper, and a touch of vermouth. served in a mason jar, over ice, with a martini glass and cherry peppers.Bayou Greens Salad- Fresh seasonal gourmet greens, diced red peppers, fire-roasted pecans, roma tomato, homemade creole vinaigrette. Flash Fried Artichoke Hearts - Artichoke hearts dipped in cornmeal buttermilk batter, flash-fried and served with a homemade buttermilk dressing. Palace Pasta Royale - Filet mignon, caramelized onions, mushroom Worcestershire cream sauceBlackened Filet Mignon - Filet mignon, roasted red potatoes, seasonal vegetables. Tender filet mignon, nicely cooked potatoes, buttery and delicious veggies make for a hearty meal!Jambalaya Sauce Piquante - Shrimp, andouille sausage, chicken, spices, tomato creole sauce, dirty rice. My favorite, this is so just savory, filled with spices and filled with a nice amount of shrimp, sausage, chicken and more. Bayou Etouffee - Tender crawfish tails or shrimp, diced bell pepers and onions, traditional seafood stock dark roux, creole seasoned rice. Muffins - Banana walnut and jalapeno cheddar cornBread Pudding Souffle - Souffle bread pudding with grand marnier and raisins, whiskey cream saucePalace Chocolate Souffle - Chocolate souffle served with a whiskey cream sauce",5 star rating,Aryo S.

3/17/2021,"San Francisco, CA","I'm so glad I decided to try this place!! Came here on an extremely windy Monday evening with a friend. At first, I thought they were closed because I saw the front area was empty but after a few seconds of looking and poking around, a waiter came out and let us know that they were open and actually had seating in the back! I was so glad to hear that because it was so windy and the walls in the back helped protect against the wind!! We sat down and the ~vibes~ were very New Orleans-esque which I LOVED. They played music and had lights strung up. Inside the restaurant (which is closed now due to COVID) also had paintings and the whole thing reminded me of the Princess and the Frog.The waiter recommended the fried crawfish tails to us as an appetizer with a sherry vinegar sauce. We ordered and it came out pretty quickly along with some free muffins. The muffins were jalapeno cheddar corn muffin and banana. The muffins had a crust on the outside which I didn't expect but they were still tasty! The fried crawfish tails were a bit disappointing as I mainly tasted the breading and not the crawfish. It also was not as crispy as I expected despite looking golden brown. The sherry vinegar sauce was not something I personally was a fan of however.I ordered the jambalaya sauce piquante and dang. It was DELISH! Jam packed with flavor, each bite was heaven. The chicken was still moist and I love how it also has shrimp and sausage. It came out steaming hot and filled me up so quickly. I finished half and took the rest home. I think my only critique is that it gets a bit heavy so it'd be nice to have some relief (perhaps some roasted veggies?). The waiter recommended a bread pudding souffle but I was just waaaay too stuffed to get dessert unfortunately ): good thing I plan to head back sometime soon to sample their other creations!!",4 star rating,Stephanie N.
1/27/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Hi SB, this is a warning to avoid The Palace Grill. In my food was a napkin and a receipt for 2 days ago (1/25/21) crumbled in a ball and cooked into my food. I didn't find it until after it was in my mouth. I brought it back to the restaurant and they comfirmed that it is from their restaurant and from 2 days ago. I'm not sure how a restaurant that has 3 employees in it has trash laying around for 2 days that gets cooked into a dish, especially in a time of exteme sanitation. I can not explain to you how thorough disgusted I am.",1 star rating,steve s.
3/27/2021,"Northern California, CA",Friendly staff (relatable). The waiter continuously came and filled our water cups. Appetizers were full of flavor. Good portions. We could have done without the Shrimp Filled Po Boy. It was ok for us. COVID restrictions enforced; which made us more comfortable. Would definitely recommend.,4 star rating,Cin V.
5/28/2021,"Huntington Beach, CA","Happened upon The Palace on a visit to Santa Barbara. The staff was just so welcoming and friendly. The food is NOLA authentic. And the martinis? Well, they speak for themselves. As the state recovers from what has been a horrific year for many, The Palace was like a warm hug from family. Shout out to Ethan, Louis and Mondo. The ""What A Wonderful World"" singalong was icing on the cake!",5 star rating,Caitriona F.
5/26/2021,"Compton, CA",My husband and I were huge fans of this place years ago. We finally got the chance to go back and were sadly disappointed. The menu was not anything to be excited about. They used to give you several flavors of mini muffins but this time only gave us 2 flavors and they were undercooked.  We ordered their bread pudding for dessert and it was HORRIBLE! It was mushy and tasted like cinnamon toast crunch that's left soaking in milk. I was so sad. I didn't feel it was worth all the money we spent.,2 star rating,Karla R.
5/8/2021,"Cerritos, CA",The food and service was great. A little pricey but I still recommend giving it a try if you're in the area. We ordered the crabcakes and redfish. The redfish is delicious and the crabcakes were good too but the texture was a little mushy for my taste.,4 star rating,Leng K.
1/7/2021,"Carpinteria, CA","A little of New Orleans in downtown Santa Barbara.   Walking around downtown we were intrigued by a jazz player sign. Under it was The Palace Grill, offering Cajun/Creole fare.   Mondo (server) came out to the ordering/menu table and asked if we had any question.  We had already ordered dinner ( down the street) so instead we choose to order a couple of cocktails (to go).  Of course we ordered a New Orleans favorite a Sazerac.  It was delicious!!!!    Mondo was a delight to talk with.  He even gave us some muffins to enjoy with our cocktail back at home.  We hope to visit soon to try their food (all highly rated on Yelp.). Also, looking forward to the day we can eat inside and enjoy the New Orleans atmosphere.",5 star rating,Donna B.
5/29/2021,"San Rafael, CA","Have gone to the Palace Grill for dinner and drinks while visiting Santa Barbara for almost 25 years. Great food, great drinks and great service. Authentic NOLA vibe right down to the music. Don't miss it!",5 star rating,Stephen D.
5/28/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Get the soufflé!   Came here tonight with my wife and Kids  They loved it. This place has great atmosphere with music playing and people just having fun. And they have a roaming magician that does magic tricks at your table. Plus the service is excellent. The first thing you need to order is the soufflé for dessert. It takes a long time to make so you have to order it with your entree. We had jambalaya, gumbo, popcorn shrimp as well as the pasta kids dish. All were great.  My kids loved the soufflé.",5 star rating,T D.
11/24/2020,"San Mateo, CA","Overall, 3.5 stars. Saved Palace Grill for our last dinner in Santa Barbara. They have about 7 outdoor dining tables  and heat lamps to keep you warm during COVID. The service was very friendly and we loved the overall atmosphere with the upbeat music, patio wood deck, and lights. Service was very friendly and our food came out quick. Here's what we ordered:Crawfish Popcorn: It was hard to taste the crawfish underneath the batter. A little too much batter, which made them soft and not crispy. Pasta Royale: Our favorite dish. The pasta was rich, creamy, and full of flavor. There was definitely some sort of strong cheese in the sauce that we couldn't figure out. Filet pieces were tender. Jambalaya: Good, but not great. Had a lot of chicken, sausage, and shrimp. The dish was extremely salty, so I could only eat a few bites. Chocolate Souflee: Good way to end the meal. You have to order ahead, since it takes 30 minutes to make.",4 star rating,Lauren N.
11/8/2020,"Gulfport, MS","The Palace Grill truly never disappoints- even during COVID. They were very accommodating and have seats on the back patio which we preferred as it still felt like we were getting the New Orleans experience that comes with The Palace Grill. My husband and I come here every year for our anniversary. They have a somewhat limited menu due to COVID, but The Palace Pasta Royale is to die for. If you come during a time they're serving the palace oysters as an appetizer these are also amazing, but the best part is always dessert- their soufflés",5 star rating,Danni V.
5/12/2021,"Thousand Oaks, CA","My favorite Cajun place. Not only a great atmosphere but exceptional food. I've been coming almost my whole life and food has not gone downhill. U can really order anything and can't go wrong! I have tried almost everything on the menu and each time I come try and get something new, as I know it won't disappoint. Its a lil bit of a drive but it's a pretty one and well worth it. Food here is on the pricey side so it's usually for special occasions! Expect to spend 60+ for yourself and one guest. I love their mini muffins. A jalapeño cornbread and banana nut are to die for. Also anything with crawdads here is excellent and of course those bread puddings. Either the chocolate or bread, both have a whiskey sauce...yum! Give em a go! Also service here is A1",5 star rating,Emily C.
5/9/2021,"Northridge, CA","Red fish was excellent! Sides, wine, appetizers...not so much. The interior is okay, service was pleasing but again, the red fish was excellent. It was like a big fat steak on my plate that I cut into. However, I won't be going back. If I want authentic NO/creole food I'll go somewhere else. This wasn't the home cooking NO food which it is, and which is what I expect. This was more like someone had an idea for a type of cuisine that was missing in SB so they found some recipes and opened a restaurant. I'll wait for passion.",3 star rating,Mel C.

9/29/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Palace Grill is an absolute institution in SB. For years and years it has provided a joyful background for thousands of Birthday, Anniversary, and bachelorette/bachelor parties. Consistently voted the restaurant with the best service in town, there is very little not to like about this place.For starters, the theme is 'Nawlins and the food is Cajun - something you won't find anywhere else in SB. Twice a night they pass around lyrics and it's group sing along time to ""what a wonderful World"". Even the biggest grump in the world will be belting out lyrics after imbibing in one of their famous martinis served in a mason jar. The food is also outstanding. They'll start you off with an assortment of delicious mini muffins and then try to sell you on the Louisiana red fish, which is only available sometimes, but is very good. Better though, imho, is the pasta lafitte. A large serving will definitely fill up any two humans. The Palace is definitely in my top 5 places in town. I'd highly suggest checking it out.",5 star rating,Dare H.
8/22/2020,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA","Can't believe all these years & I've never reviewed this restaurant. This place is one of the main reasons for visiting SB. The menu due to Covid is limited for now, but nonetheless still worth the drive. My usual go tos are the flash fried artichoke and/or plantation chicken as an appetizer, but aren't available at this time. The salad has a nice light dressing to start out with. Muffins are a nice replacement for the usual bread n butter. Mains are the crawfish crab cakes or crawfish pasta. I've had bites of their jambalaya and it's amazing. Sides of gumbo and red beans and rice are delicious too. Don't skip on the dessert. Order both the chocolate soufflé and bread pudding....yes BOTH!!Service has always been super friendly and professional. Everyone is so nice and engaging. Genuine smiles and great personalities! Always have had a wonderful experience here over the last 15yrs.",5 star rating,Meli N.
5/2/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA",This was my first experience here and was delivery due to COVID.  The food was a strong 4.5/5 and the service despite being delivery was outstanding.  Definitely recommend- very flavorful and a refreshing change of flavor from 90% of the other restaurants in SB.  Try it!,5 star rating,Scout A.
9/22/2020,"San Jose, CA","We decided to try this place and order take out, we ordered popcorn crawfish, jambalaya, gumbo, and steak. I did not like the popcorn crawfish at all, I was expecting something crispier but instead it was very doughy and chewy. The rest of my group liked their food, the jambalaya pasta was good. Overall, maybe the food would have been tastier if it was fresh and we ate there? But it was not bad.",3 star rating,Glenna M.
9/19/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm so sorry to rate Palace Grill low. If i could rate just the  staff I would give 10 stars on a 5 star scale. They are amazing. Our server Talia and a guy named Mondo (we didn't know his role) were kind, warm, welcoming, friendly.  We had another guy at our table but we didn't catch his name or role either. I ate here before about 3 years ago I believe and I wasn't fond of the food then, but when we returned last night I was excited to try Palace Grill. But our food was not our bag. The red fish was okay, but the veggies, and the jambalaya picante were unremarkable. We wanted to love it  because it's highly rated and loved the staff. There was a side perk, we were lucky to have curbside seating to the neighborhood favorite Pug Bernhardt's one-man-band event. His music was fun and refreshing.",2 star rating,Mechell G.
8/29/2020,"Galt, CA",Omg where to start? My boyfriend took me here for dinner for my birthday. Due to COVID my trip was canceled so he surprised me with a trip to Santa Barbara. We came here for dinner. I had the blackened redfish with all veggies no potatoes since I'm on the keto diet. He has crab cakes and all veggies no rice. I had tequila with club soda and lime and he had a glass of rose. Omg the food was to die for and so flavorful. They also brought ya complimentary banana nut muffins and jalapeño muffins. The banana nut muffins were so good and warm but I didn't really like the jalapeño ones. Omg I want to come back. The service was great and the food was good. Will definitely be back!,5 star rating,Ms. Krystall M.
11/16/2019,"San Luis Obispo, CA","I have been here a couple times with my mother in-law who is from Mississippi and she loves it.  Reminds her of home.  Each table gets a basket of delicious muffins in lieu of bread as a starter and they are divine!They have specials everyday ao there is always something new to try.I have never had a bad meal here and this last visit was especially fun as the wait staff walked around and delivered sealed menus and said not to open them until we were told... it ended up being the lyrics to a song for a sing along.  During the song they walked around and toasted to each table. It was so fun and everyone in the restaurant sang along.  I don't know how often they do it but I felt lucky we were there that night. If you are looking for an authentic southern meal, you must try The Palace.  It is easy to find off State street downtown.",5 star rating,Erin S.
2/14/2021,"Goleta, CA","I love this place! When you need some heart and soul back in your life think about The Palace! Great food and great people! We decided to order some gumbo, etouffee, and bread pudding to have while watching The Princess and the Frog with our daughter for Valentines Day during the pandemic. The wonderful food arrived, but without the signature palace muffins that our daughter had her heart set on. When I called to let them know the manager offered to hand deliver our muffins... which he did, and they were warm and fresh!!!  It is this type of caring that helps me believe we will all make it through these crazy times!!!!

Oh and I like that they give out the complementary cornbread and muffin assorted basket as a starter. The entrees are good, but very rich.

8/12/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Visited Palace Grill on 7/27 during my weekend visit in Santa Barbara. This review is solely based on the food. I don't necessarily believe this restaurant is trying to maintain authenticity as I believe it's just trying to give you a New Orleans vibe (if that makes sense). Decor:The bldg itself has a mom and pop feel. It's semi small, but they neatly fit ample amount of seating in the bldg. We actually saw a table of 12 eating comfortably. They used playing cards as their main decoration with pictures of jazz artist and figurines throughout.  It was not busy and we were able to sit down without waiting (we went around 2p.m.)Hosts:The host were very kind. I saw them visiting tables often to makes sure patrons were well taken care of. Food: Again, I don't believe they were trying to be authentic in their food's but as close as they can be. However, I don't think they reached it.  We ordered the Cajun popcorn for an appetizer, and two Jambalaya Pasta's. The presentation was good, but the food was bland and some what a bit off in seasonings. For dessert we had the New Orleans Beignets and the Dark Chocolate Soufflé. I enjoyed the Soufflé's more than the Beignets. Nevertheless, they were both good. This restaurant has potential, and I look forward to the progress that can be made.",3 star rating,Melanie B.

5/30/2019,"Burbank, CA","Surprised to find pretty hood soul food in Santa Barbara. It's not New Orleans Gumbo that you will find but it is the same style. The decor will take you out of the polished state street area and will make it feel like a dressed down occasion. The prices are a little higher as to be expected in the area. The drinks are sweet which is good for many but it's not exactly my cup of tea. We started out with drinks and I had my rum with the gumbo. It was pretty good and definitely scratched the itch. I'm not too big on pasta but made an exception for my girlfriend's birthday. The glowing recommendation from the nice staff also helped sway me into buying the jambalaya which didn't disappoint. There was nothing miraculous or anything that stood out. Okay service, good food and a decent price and atmosphere.",4 star rating,Alfredo S.
1/22/2019,"Santa Margarita, CA","I have been eating here for twenty years--in good ways, it never changes. The popcorn crawfish and yaya gumbo are all I would ever order and are on my death row meal menu! Thankfully, I go here sometimes with others and try their food too. My son got the filet mignon from the kids' menu--perfectly cooked! So yes, they have a 12 dollar portion of the child menu--but succulent and worth every bite. The wife's crawfish pasta was creamy, heavy, perfectly spiced, almost like a Cajun alfredo.And the Cajun martini, with pepper infused vodka, made the rest of the afternoon hazy!",5 star rating,Brett S.
12/22/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love this place!  I have been a couple times over the years and, when we went last week for a company Christmas dinner, I was reminded of how much I love it! We had 10 people for dinner so I called ahead of time to make a reservation & it was made with no problem.  We went on a Wednesday night so it was easy to get a reservation, but I would definitely call way in advance for large groups on the weekends as it's always packed when I walk by.  The breakdown:Waitstaff: Large groups are always hard, but the waitstaff handled our group like the pros that they are! They were very attentive, kind, and efficient. Everyone's orders were correct & there is a part of the evening where they pass out song sheets & you all sing What A Wonderful World together.  Food: Come hungry! We started with the coconut shrimp & Cajun Popcorn (crawfish) for appetizers & they also give you mini muffins (the kind varies from night to night). Both appetizers were fried & delicious! The Cajun Popcorn is what they're known for so this is definitely a must!  I got the jambalaya over dirty rice & I am still thinking about how good it was! I ended up taking half of it home & it was still just as good the next day. I would recommend going with one of their tried & true Cajun dishes. People at the table who did not get one of these traditional dishes were not as big of fans of their meal. We ended dinner with the bread pudding (another Palace specialty) & it was also SO good! Definitely a great place to go with a group (small or large) so you can share!Ambiance: The place is decorated with a Mardi Gras theme & it has a very Louisiana feel.  For those not easily offended, make sure to check out the art in the bathroom.   For those who are easily offended, you've been warned.

2/22/2020,"Isla Vista, CA","The Palace Grill is a must if you're in Santa Barbara. The Louisiana inspired decor and menu are a delight. As you're waiting for your food you can snack on the assorted cornbread that they'll place on your table. I came here with a group of 14 people and the service was excellent, the food was delicious, and reasonably priced. I had the shrimp po'boy, ask for extra sauce. The shrimp tasted very fresh. I only wish there was more shrimp in the sandwhich.",5 star rating,Amber M.
10/31/2018,"San Jose, CA","So I know there's a lot of great reviews, and my friend raved about this place which is why we went, so I suppose that's why it was such a let down. Went on a Sunday for dinner so it was a bit quieter, there was none of the singing that my friend mentioned goes on at dinner. Maybe that's Saturday's only? We were seated by the wall near the front window and there were all sorts of flies hanging out on the wall. So that's lovely...The starter muffin basket was good, we ate all of them lol, and I actually really liked the plain buttermilk one. I ordered some oysters Rockefeller which I enjoyed, and then we split the giant jambalaya pasta and preordered the chocolate soufflé. We should have ordered the normal sized pasta bc it really was way too much food. And something really must not have agreed with me in the pasta bc my stomach was killing me and I was fine earlier. Kind of ruined the rest of my night :/ Soufflé was pretty good but I couldn't really enjoy it at that point. Anyways, not the best experience. 2 stars bc I got sick, and that's a pretty big deterrent for me. I want to enjoy eating my food! There are lots of other restaurants in SB so I most likely won't be coming back.",2 star rating,Amanda I.
8/10/2019,"Oxnard, CA","This unique Louisiana / Santa Barbara charmer is the GEM of the Nile. You can't go wrong eating at The Palace Grill.  We highly recommend scheduling a reservation online or via telephone, it assures you a table without waiting.  We've been going here for about 15 years now and not once have we ever been disappointed.  We always dress nicely for dinner.  There are approximately 20 tables.  We have never experienced an empty or slow restaurant. It is always jumping.The atmosphere is lively. quaint, comfy and friendly.  The food is to die for.  Usually after drink orders, the bus boy brings you the most SCRUMPTIOUS & DIVINE, melt in your mouth, mini muffins.  Pay close attention to the flavors because they are HEAVENLY.  The rosemary ones are our favorite muffins, followed by the jalapeño muffins.  The meals are absolutely delicious and they do not disappoint.  Our all time favorite meals are the DIVERS SCALLOPS & the FILET MIGNON (pictures attached).  Both meals were accompanied with fresh, local and seasonal vegetables.  The Diver Scallops came with rice pilaf with artichokes, caramelized onions and mushrooms.  It was magic in my mouth, simply divine.  The Filet Mignon came with garlic mashed potatoes & was delicious.  After we finished our meals, our Chocolate Soufflé arrived.  This was hands down the BEST Soufflé we've ever eaten.  This elegant restaurant is meant to be enjoyed.  Don't go there and be in a hurry.  We had a concert at the Bowl to get to, so if you are in a hurry, just let your server know and they will take terrific care of you.  THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Share it with someone special!  We also had my daughters 21st birthday celebration here, it was an ABSOLUTE HIT!  It is accommodating to both the young and the old alike.  SIMPLY FABULOUS! .",5 star rating,Wendy H.
10/21/2020,"San Diego, CA","I'll come back after COVID, as it probably puts them off their game. The staff is nice and helpful, but the food needs work:1. Cornbread is bland and needs a touch of sugar 2. Etoufee looks great but needs more spices and seasoning3. Crabcakes need crab and heft (keep them thick - not splayed out - it's too easy to overcook when flattened like a pancake)4. Popcorn crawfish is a little too heavy on the batter - it absorbs the oil and makes this dish heavier than it should be5. Veggies - were either undercooked or overcooked",4 star rating,CHi C.
2/20/2020,"South Pasadena, CA","We were in Santa Barbara for the weekend from LA for my boyfriend's birthday and I wanted to find a restaurant with good bread pudding. I was recommended this place by a few people so I wanted to give it a try. We had crawlfish popcorn for appetizer which was quite tasty. I wish it came with lemon as it was a bit salty for my taste. My boyfriend had blackened filet mignon which he enjoyed but I thought was just okay. I had Palace Etouffee which was quite tasty but the side vegetables were overcooked. The bread pudding was very mushy inside because of the custard they added right after they baked it. I wish it wasn't so mushy. The ice cream and the whip cream that were on the side were okay. Our server was very friendly and they put the dessert on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday"" which was really nicely presented. The most fun part was when we were handed the lyrics for ""What a Wonderful World"" and everyone in the restaurant started singing together. While the food was mostly okay and the bread pudding was not what we expected, the experience there was still pleasant. I would recommend it for a fun Cajun food night in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Yuki K.

The atmosphere is fun and lively.We had Diver Scallop, so fresh and delicious, and filet mignon pasta, so yummy and perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had their special soufflé which you need to order ahead of time (30' to 40' to prepare) Moreover they are quite flexible on substitutes and special requests. For instance, we add vegetables on the steak pasta free of chargeHowever there is not much options for side orders We definitely would recommend the Palace Grill to our friends and family",5 star rating,Lola N.
7/27/2018,"Irvine, CA","Some good, some okay, imo but I was a little disappointed with the brokenly high levels of sodium in the food!!!Let me start with the service and the food positives. Service is fantastic here. Got our food and drinks quickly and promptly. Loved getting refills at a good pace while chatting with friends. It was excellent. Some of the food was good. I enjoyed the desserts the most here, especially the whiskey cream sauce that came with the soufflé. The Complimentary Bread was sweet but not overwhelming too. Drinks were solid and fair. The atmosphere is good too seeing art and cards scattered on the roof. There's a lot of interesting stuff to talk with your peers here.I got to try a little bit of the Veal and Popcorn Crawfish from my friends and thought it was okay but oh man it was Salty with a big S. By itself I wasn't too impressed but with the sauce it was somewhat better. I think the Jambalaya Pasta is okay, wasn't spicy like I thought it'd be but again, it was the sauce that helped an otherwise okay dish. Maybe it's because I haven't had Cajun food in awhile but unfortunately I'm not a fan of everything that wasn't a sauce here. The crab itself that I had was pretty chock full of sodium and the vegetables were of poor quality with the texture being borderline wet cardboard in my opinion. Overall, good place to hangout for drinks and dessert. Still, an interesting place to hang out and chill if you got a sizable party.",3 star rating,George L.

6/4/2018,"San Mateo, CA","I see baskets of muffins and bowls of gumboPaintings on the wall, artists nicely draw, And I think to myself what a wonderful world!The moment I walk into the Palace Grill, I'm instantly transported to the city of New Orleans. I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans a few years ago and must say the environment is quite similar to New Orleans. The decorations, especially the lamp pole with beaded necklaces hanging off of it, are exceptional and give off the New Orleans vibes. The dim lighting and red neon lights give off a nice glow to set the mood for the hourly sing-alongs. The only thing they're missing are beignets as a starter (which is listed under the desserts section), and are substituted for complimentary cornbread muffins. I'm not complaining because those muffins are delicious! I have a bit of a sweet tooth so my favorites are the apricot and the banana nut muffins. I started off with a bowl of SEAFOOD GUMBO, which is a classic in Lousiana. They offer two different kinds of gumbos, including the gumbo ya ya and seafood gumbo. The difference is that the gumbo ya ya has chicken and andouille sausage, and the seafood gumbo contains seafood. I was craving seafood that day so I ordered the seafood gumbo. The soup was exactly what I expected: rich, thick, and creamy. Yum! For the main dish, I ordered one of their most popular pasta dishes, the JAMBALAYA PASTA. The pasta dish included bits of chicken, shrimp, and andouille sausage all mixed in with a tomato creole sauce and topped with a sprinkle of spice and green onions. I enjoyed the flavors and spices of this dish since it contained penne pasta and not rice, which is traditional. I also ordered the blackened FILET MIGNON. There's an option to choose if you want the steak blackened or grilled. The steak was tender, but it was a bit overcooked since I enjoy my steak medium rare. Other than that, the food was quite tasty! Furthermore, the service was great! The server was patient and took the time to explain and point out what was inside each muffin. The most unique concept of the restaurant are the hourly sing-alongs! The servers pass out a songbook to each table, walk around with a glass, clink glasses with each other and other customers, and we all have a jolly good time!",4 star rating,Michelle F.

6/14/2018,"Long Beach, CA","Visited The Palace Grill with my husband on a Wednesday evening. The hostesses and servers were all very friendly.  This was my first creole food experience and LOVED EVERYTHING about this place!I ordered the Blackened Fresh Louisiana Redfish (Market Price was $30 in June 2018) with a side of double veggies instead of veggies and red potatoes.  My husband ordered the Blackened Fresh Salmon with a side of veggies and red potatoes. After ordering our meals, one of the servers brought us a delicious basket full of a variety of muffins: Jalapeño, molasses, apricot, banana, rosemary, and cornbread.  We also ordered desserts since the server mentioned that it took 40 minutes to make: Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle (bread pudding with Grand Marnier and raisins served with warm Whiskey Cream sauce) and Dark Chocolate Souffle (Served with Bourbon Cream sauce).I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Blackened Fresh Redfish!  The fish was flaky and flavorful!  The veggies were cooked and seasoned to perfection!  My husband also loved the Blackened Fresh Salmon.  It was extremely flavorful and unforgettable!The desserts were memorable and we enjoyed them very much!  The decor in the restaurant included performers, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Louis Armstrong.  Also, when it was almost 8PM, the hostesses distributed a play list and then the servers asked everyone in the restaurant to sing along.  When the song, Wonderful World came on, all of us sang and the owner and servers all went around to every table and toasted cheers!  It was such a fun evening filled with delicious food and positive and fun energy!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PALACE GRILL!",5 star rating,Claire G.
3/29/2018,"La Mirada, CA","Came to The Palace Grill for lunch this afternoon. Located in Downtown Santa Barbara on Cota St near State St. It's known for their Cajun and seafood, oh and some wines. Out of all the restaurants I have on my list, this one wasn't one of them, but I was glad I checked this one out, for an good reason.Drink:Here's one particular drink you don't see everyday, especially in an beach town, Tropical Hurricane Martini. Sound fruity and tropical right? This one has an strong taste of the alcohol. I usually don't do much strong stuff, but I must say this one is good.Food:This one is real interesting, Palace Pasta Royale. Sure, why not? It's an pretty good pasta dish. Tastes wonderful for sure. It was actually the waiter's second favorite dish in this restaurant. Totally worth getting nowadays. Price:Unlike Cheesecake Factory and some other restaurants and bars, they do list their prices on wines and other alcohol, which by the way it was $12 for the Tropical Hurricane Martini. And $13 for the Palace Pasta Royale (Lunch special).Parking:Public parking lot, 75 minutes free and $1.50 every hour after that.Overall:Pretty solid place to try for sure.

3/6/2018,"Houston, TX","Oh my gosh...where do I even begin with The Palace Grill? Santa Barbara hosted its first Restaurant Week at the end of last month, and Emily L. and I took it as a sign to finally try this place out. Neither of us have ever been to Louisiana, but we know good food when we see it. We ordered all three of our courses in one go -- I had the gumbo ya ya (some mixture of gumbo and jumbolaya), fried soft-shelled crab, and dark chocolate souffle. Emily L. ordered the crawfish popcorn, scallops in jalapeno beurre-blanc sauce, and bread pudding souffle. Of course, we went for refills on their phenomenal cornbread muffins. With a smear of butter, the jalapeno cheddar and banana walnut muffins were perfect. (She had to stop and beg me to take them home or else we wouldn't finish our food...)The standouts were the crawfish popcorn, soft-shelled crab, and bread pudding souffle. Don't get me wrong -- every dish we ordered was so tasty, and even reheated as leftovers, tasted like what I imagine had just come out of a Cajun kitchen in the South. However, each of these dishes were special. The crawfish popcorn are oddly addictive, and if I tasted correctly, the dipping sauce is some play on lobster bisque. Talk about bougie. The soft-shelled crab was fried to perfection. No awkward shells got stuck in the back of my throat. When paired with their fragrant rice, my three crabs were magical. Bread pudding souffle deserves its own paragraph. honestly. I love dried fruit in baked goods, so the plump golden raisins were quite a treat. Paired with a dreamy whiskey cream sauce, the only thing I regretted was being too full to finish it. At $35 each for a three-course meal, this was a steal! We would definitely come back, sans dessert. I paid extra for a hurricane margarita, a treat for me because Emily L. was driving. Our sweet server brought it out in practically no time and I can confirm that as others have noted, their drinks are strong and pretty! Nothing like a rainbow hued, jazzed-up drink in a mason jar to give you an excuse to order crawfish popcorn, in my opinion.The Palace Grill was voted 'best service' in Santa Barbara by readers of the Independent for what I believe is 26 or 28 years now. We're both inclined to agree -- not once did we run out of muffins, low on water, or empty on happiness. We felt inclined to leave a great tip and a comment on their feedback cards because the staff who helped us were oh-so-sweet.I also love that they hand out songbooks and ask you to sing along to Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World."" One of my favorite Italian places, C&O Trattoria down in Marina Del Rey, does something similar and I think it's so cute! A perfect, fun way to spend an evening.",5 star rating,Gwen W.
7/15/2018,"San Francisco, CA","This place was pretty solid, though not necessarily out of this world.  The food and drinks were good, the service was very friendly though at times slow, and the the setting was casual, baby-friendly and distinctly NOLA-themed.My husband and I shared the following dishes:1) Complimentary muffins - excellent!2) Popcorn crawfish tails - good, though heavy 3) Seafood gumbo - flavorful 4) Crabcake starter - delicious!5) Crawfish etouffe - quite good6) Bread pudding - tasty, but richMy husband got the Cajun martini and thought it was ""just okay"" - I felt the same way about my mango iced tea.The service was friendly but slow.  After greeting us, our waitress took quite a while to return to take our orders.  Later, the gap between the courses was sometimes too long.The NOLA- themed setting was casual and baby-friendly.  We felt welcomed when we arrived with our 10 week old baby in a stroller.Overall, this place was lovely, and we look forwarding to returning on a future visit to SB!",4 star rating,Barnali D.

The shrimps were small.  This one had simple ingredients, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and basil.

4/8/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","One of the few restaurants in Santa Barbara that actually makes me feel like I'm in a different location (namely, NOLA) - gotta love it.The Palace is one of only a handful of decades-old SB restaurants that have stood the test of time. Dining here is a unique, special experience that you won't find elsewhere. I love how entire waitstaff serves every table, and how the entire restaurant will stop and sing/toast simultaneously. Additionally, I really enjoy when the jazz band plays right outside for those in line. Pretty cool!I always love when the bread/muffin variety is brought out. There's a little something for everyone in regards to the flavors, and I love how they're always warm and fresh. I'm also a big fan of their soufflés, pure perfection. The food menu is vast and quite authentic, as far as Southern fare goes. It's on the pricier side, but well worth it for a special occasion. Everything I've ordered from here is wonderful. Good service, too. Do come here if you're in the mood for quality Southern eats in a unique environment.",5 star rating,Eric G.
1/22/2019,"Goleta, CA","When I am researching where to go to dinner, I a few key factors help influence my decision:-Dishes served that I can't make at home-Stellar table service-Stiff craft drinks-Fun, themed ambiance-Tasty dessertsThe Palace Grill checks all these items off the list...and more! They have cajun inspired dishes, many of which I am unfamiliar but always willing to try (i.e. Cajun Crawfish Popcorn, Blackened Redfish, Louisiana Soft Shell Crabs, and Chicken Tchoupitoulas). The staff is very welcoming and friendly, plus works as a team. So much so that they pass out cards with songs to sing along to as they walk around to cheers you with their glasses of wine. I have a horrible voice and hate singing, yet get some alcohol in me and a loud crowd, and I'll join right in! Speaking of alcohol, they have tasty, boozy cocktails such as a Tropical Hurricane, Rum Punch and Cajun Martini for those who love spicy hot peppers. The restaurant is quaint and cozy with close seating and vibrant New Orleans colors and decor. I have to end my meal with a dessert. Who can't be persuaded by Dark Chocolate Soufflé (order in advance--my favorite with the chocolate bourbon cream sauce), Sweet Potato Pecan Pie and Bananas Foster. That is if you still have space after their complimentary mini muffins and entree. Keep in mind that their beignets are only available during lunchtime.Be sure to check out this Santa Barbara classic--you're bound to enjoy yourself.",5 star rating,Richie D.
1/16/2019,"Hawthorne, CA","This place is definitely a hard ""no"" for me. I went last weekend for my friend's engagement party. We did have a rather large group - not sure what my friend's experience was as far as reservations go, but our group was for 25 people.My boyfriend and I had already eaten so we just wanted drinks. Let's just say our waitress was not too happy at the thought of that. I did try one of their little mini muffins though - it was a jalapeño cornbread style one that had no flavor. I tried their Cajun Martini which I was pretty excited about, considering how unique it sounded. It was disgusting - pretty sure they use poor quality booze in that drink because the after taste was terrible. I didn't drink it and no one else wanted it. Anyway, the overall vibe of the place threw me off. People were raving about the performances and entertainment aspect, but we sang one song and that was it (mind you, this was also a Saturday night, when one might expect the most action). To me, Palace Grill is just some dilapidated building trying to pose as a restaurant.",1 star rating,Andrea V.
1/17/2018,"Santa Clara, CA","If you are looking for NOLA food without the street grossness of the French Quarter this place is it. Oh man I come here every time I'm in Santa Barbara. So this must have been between my 5-10th time for dinner?So I would make reservations if you can. However, they dont take reservations unless it's at 5:30 for Fridays and Saturdays I believe. You can make reservations online or call them. The people who answer the phone are very nice :) This past time I took my best friend since she had never been before. We had 5:30 Saturday reservations and were one of the first ones there. Our waiter, Anne (I think?), was very nice and always came to check on us, seeing if we needed a box or more water. Since we were planning to eat more later, we split the crawfish etouffe and the crawfish pasta lafite and ordered a louisiana bread pudding souffle in advance for dessert. (Plan your meals out folks!)They brought out their AMAZING biscuits first and we quickly devoured those. They come with banana, apricot, jalapeno, molasses, and cheddar I believe. And they're warm. Anne brought us another round of biscuits that we couldnt finish, but believe me we ate them all later. Our food came out pretty fast and they even split our etouffe in the back for us! The food isnt as rich as NOLA, but was still full of tons of flavor and spice. I ordered a lemon drop which comes in a martini glass and a mason jar and my friend ordered a bourbon on the rocks which was FREAKING strong! But these were perfect for toast time!What's toast time? Well it happens pretty frequently. They bring out these laminated song lyrics and pass them out to patrons. And when the music starts playing, you can open them up and sing along! But I dont need it because What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong is a song everyone should know. During this song, waiters come around to clink glasses with us and cheers us while we all belt out the words. It's a wonderful feeling or camaraderie and love, especially in the world we live in today. The Palace wasnt a full house even when we left, but was still very busy.

Generally speaking they have it goin on. They have Redfish and organic Catfish, whatever that means, and Crawfish. One of my favorite things in the world. Disclaimer!  I have been traveling to NO annually for the last 22 years. Tonight, a Tuesday, the place had some issues. First, the set an assortment of small muffins on your table as the opener. They were all dry tonight. Next up, I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller. 4 of 6 were OK. The other 2 were over-charred. May have been easy to sneak by cuz they're covered in Hollandaise but not tonight!  Then, the blackened Redfish. This was very good even though it was a little overcooked. Passable for sure. Good side veggies and 2 whole red potatoes baked perfect. Lastly, the chocolate soufflé. You must order this as soon as the notion strikes you and I recommend you do.

The weekend we were there was an unusually busy weekend because of an Annual Tex Mex celebration they hold in SB every year. We luckily got in without reservation. The wait staff was friendly and accommodated us. They were very informative and place was busy but pleasant. We had started with Crawfish fried appetizer  and some of their bread. I had a Redemption old fashion. The Creole inspired menu was good and the portions were generous. I had ordered the Shrimp etoufee and Wifey had ordered the Gumbo. The Pasta my son ordered was vegetarian and had a spicy kick. My only complaint if I had one was that they took my drink away when I was paying the check. I was only 1/2 way through my drink.

Something for every taste! My favorite is the Rosemary! Y-u-u-m-m-y!!!For main dishes everything has a creole flair. You can get Jambalaya, Blacked Filet, Pasta and the elusive Blacked Red Fish! The Red Fish is amazing and sells out quick, so if they have it while you are there, you best be ordering it!Nightly, they hand out song lyrics to Louis Armstrong 'Wonderful World' or 'That's Amore' and everyone sings and cheers the waiters.

My husbands family is from New Orleans and so he's a bit discerning when it comes to Cajun food. Anytime we have gone out for Cajun/southern cuisine in the past he's usually not particularly impressed. Last night was the exception to that rule! The food was incredible. We ordered a ton of appetizers and none of them disappointed. The oysters palace was our favorite for sure. All of the entrees were spot on and we ordered bread pudding soufflé and a bananas foster.

5/6/2018,"Goleta, CA","This place is great! They are currently celebrating 33 years in business and offering a prix fixe 3 course for $33 (until the end of May). Almost all the food was amazing. - The chicken gumbo was spicy, but no more than eating a peppercorn. I am a huge fan and I could go back and just get this. - The 5 DIFFERENT mini-muffins they brought out were all good (apricot was my favorite).- The blackened catfish was just ok. I thought it would have some spice to it, but there wasn't much going on. - The jambalaya was a huge portion. I would plan on splitting it. The chicken was little dry, but I guess that's to be expected. Everything else in it was good. - The chocolate soufflé. I don't have words to describe how good it was. It brought me to a state of ""life is good.""The service was equally great. I was considering trying a few wines, but not really sure what I wanted. The waitress immediately suggested and brought out a few to taste (in a over-the-top southern hospitallity way). This is a place you can really feel at home. The bathroom decor is a gem as well. There are so many small things that bring this place together and you can't take it for face value alone. Do yourself a favor and go experience this place.",5 star rating,Clay G.

7/31/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Triple threat... great food, great drinks, and great service! This restaurant is very accommodating for large parties without a reservation. The drinks are yummy and strong, especially the cajun martini. A plus is that they give you more martini in another cup to refill, so it's like you're getting two drinks! I love the array of muffins they give you, some were dry but it was later in the evening so maybe they weren't so fresh by the end of the day. We ordered their palace sampler platter which was enough food for four, and that was half of our party! The food was on the salty side, but nothing to complain about because I was expecting yummy buttery salty cajun goodness!I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and another friend's engagement. The staff was kind enough to bring out two of our desserts personalized for both of the occasions! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for families and celebrations!",5 star rating,Lianna M.

I'd recommend making a reservation if you're trying to dine in for dinner. I love the crowded decoration and the staff were really nice. They do this music hour (or something) where they blast music and everyone sings along. My table was pretty sad that no one toasted us mid song (ahaha), but it's pretty fun to see everyone signing! Drink: We ordered the jalepeno martini (quart) which was enough for 3 people. We all were able to refill twice. The jalapeño is so tasty to eat in the end. Food: We ordered the best platter and jambalaya pasta. The platter is a little expensive but definitely worth it. Dessert: This was probably the best part of the entire meal! They gave us the original souffle with whiskey cream and it was DELICIOUS. It came with the platter. Next time if I'm craving dessert, I'd completely come here for the dessert.",4 star rating,Priscilla U.

It came paired with grilled vegetables, red potatoes, and the most amazing garlic butter sauce. Squeeze on the fresh lemon and ... wow! Talk about delicious. For dessert we had the bread pudding, we came freshly made to order and was so decadent. They served it with a whiskey creme fresh and vanilla ice cream which was an excellent touch.My wife had the spicy martini. Some people say that this is spicy, but we eat a lot of spicy food, so we didn't find it the martini to be very spicy, but it did have a good hint of heat and some people may find this more spicy than others. For dinner she had the jambalaya which was excellent. It was serve on a bed of dirty rice.Overall, the meal was delicious and someplace we'd definitely come back to again. The ambiance is awesome and while we were there, there was a moment of sign-a-long which made the atmosphere festive and memorable.

The crawfish was not my cup of tea but everyone who likes crawfish loved it.  Salad and bread were delicious. The entrees were amazing. The steak was so juicy and flavors paired with it were great. My only complaint was my daughter's dinner was forgotten so they cooked hers quickly and her steak was raw inside. I would suggest especially in a large party that they feed the kids first to help keep them busy, everyone was done when they got their food. But for managing such a large group, it was done very well otherwise. The desserts were good.  Im not a fan of alcohol flavors in bread pudding but there chocolate suffle was amazing",5 star rating,Christine K.

Talk about disappointment.....The dishes are good when shared. We ordered:Blackened Red Fish-somewhat moist fish with zuchinis, squash, and carrots...Jambalaya: a plate of meaty goop with rice...never really had REAL jambalaya but this didn't have too much flavor.Soft Shell Crab: THE BEST! The sauce was useless but eaten by itself the crab legs are semi crispy and the body is soft and tender..LOVED IT...Bread Pudding Souffle with Creamy Whiskey Sauce-nah I didn't like how the bread was not soft and gooey...takes 45 mins to be ready so order early!Scallops: they were a tad overcooked...served with rice and the zuchinnis again.Gumbo: tiny cup of gumbo with a few specks of okra and some meat.

There is a magician that walks by to entertain tables with magic card tricks and a nifty way of sticking cards on the ceiling. It adds to the whimsical New Orleans decor that fills the inside of the restaurant. Our table had the following: Blackened Fresh Catfish - This was the entree I ordered and I loved it. It was perfectly seasoned and the vegetables added a neutral taste to counter the saltiness. Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle - You definitely need to try it! The sauce that goes on the souffle is delicious!Jambalaya Pasta - I didn't order this but my friend seemed to have enjoyed it Cajun Crawfish Popcorn - I actually would not recommend this. Crawfish is small to start with so when you batter it up and fry it, there's not much to taste.

1/15/2017,"Slidell, LA","Passing through Santa Barbara on the way back from visiting some wineries, we stopped in at Palace for lunch. Now, honestly, I was a bit nervous because - being from Louisiana - my experience has been that any time I have sampled attempts at Cajun cooking outside of Louisiana I have been invariably disappointed. Not. This. Time. Finally! Someone who can do Louisiana style cooking - and do it well! For an appetizer we had Artichoke Hearts, flash fried. Crispy and delicious. For mains we split two dishes - the Jambalaya Sauce Piquante and the Fusilli Roasted Sweet Italian Sausage. Both were quite tasty with a variety of flavors coming through simultaneously. A good portion size as well leaving you enough room for dessert! Accordingly, we were compelled to give the bread puddings a try and were well rewarded - the whiskey sauce, in particular made the dish for me. The only thing I would change - is the cornbread. Not bad, but not up to the standard of everything else. Wait staff were terrific - knowledgeable and personable. Definitely check this place out!",4 star rating,Scott L.

Their 'team' approach makes the dining experience enjoyable and festive, as the entire staff is 'at your service' (and they seem consistently happy about it!). The food is amazing. The muffins they bring out to start are insanely delicious...try to eat less than three, I dare you! The crawfish popcorn is a must do as an appetizer. I love the pasta dishes with chicken, the soft-shelled crabs...and if you time it right, order the red fish. Also don't forget to order a souffle early (they take ~45 minutes and are incredible!!). The Cajun martini is a great cocktail, with just the right amount of spice, and they also have a solid wine list and good beer from the bayou region.Finally, I'll add that it's a great place for special occasions. We've celebrated birthdays and anniversaries there, even company holiday parties. Live music on the weekends (on the sidewalk), even a magician once in a while (Mark Collier is mind-blowing). Guess you can tell this place is a favorite of mine... Highly recommended for locals and visitors both!",5 star rating,Doug M.

12/25/2017,"Anaheim, CA","I'm sure this place is lots of fun during Mardi Gras season or maybe even during random weekends!I came here on a quiet Christmas Eve for lunch with my parents since I wanted to show them Cajun food that New Orleans is famous for. I wasn't sure what to expect, but thought that it's worth a try since this place is one of the most reviewed restaurants in Santa Barbara. When we walked in, there were only two other tables seated since we got there pretty much right when the restaurant opened. The staff were VERY friendly and checked up on us multiple times throughout our meal to make sure that we are satisfied with everything. Onto talking about the food - everything going from the cornbread to the dessert were amazing! The brownish (banana pecan cornbread) is a must try! We got the cajun popcorn crawfish appetizer, and shared the lunch option crawfish etouffee and jambalaya pasta. When our dishes came, I honestly thought they were smaller than I had expected and it wasn't going to be enough for 3 people (we don't even eat that much). However, as we started working on them, the food turned out to be more than it looked, and we were completely stuffed at the end! I saw on Yelp that they were also famous for their bread pudding, and was so glad that they have a lunch option which I am guessing is half the size of their usual one. We got both version of the bread pudding and loved them both! I was so happy with the presentation of the bread pudding as well! The hint of alcohol definitely put the cherry on top of the dessert and the entire meal ;)Overall, it was a great experience. The food was amazing, reasonably priced, good portions, and the service was fantastic. I would recommend this place to my friends if they were to be in town!

Then get ready for their whiskey bread pudding soufflé that will make you find room in your fully satisfied tummy.Thanks Palace! Forever yours Ps: awesome staff too!I wrote the above review years ago and just wanted to touch it up having just left NOLA. If you like Cajun food or never tried it, then this place is an absolute must. I have to say some of their dishes are even better than some of the ones I had several times in NO at some of the finest places. And if Cajun food isn't your thing, they also cater to meat and seafood eaters as well, with delicious steaks, chicken and fish dishes. On weekends it's best to make a reservation or expect to stand in line for a while, which is not so bad as they have a little band that is there to entertain you while you're drooling at the patrons dishes inside. This place is outstanding and will forever be one of my favorites anywhere.",5 star rating,Marjan B.

Faintly lit up inside along with some eerie paintings, this place sure makes up to be quite different. It was Sunday night and had some good crowd but didn't take us very long to get seated.We all were handed out sheets of paper and didn't know what was going on until we saw what was written on it. They asked us to open it only after the music started playing. We sang along with the song being played and that was fun! They served us some complimentary assorted warm muffins and butter. I have always had in-house baked bread and olive oil at most restaurants but this was better. I love muffins :)Hurricane Margarita looked and tasted so divine! The colors in the glass were so fresh and vibrant, definitely something unique! We ordered the Fried Artichoke Hearts which came alongside some zesty sauce. In the mains, ordered Pan Sautéed Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms and Mardi Gras Vegetarian Pasta Primavera. I always wanted to try Chicken Marsala because I've heard of it so much but I didn't like it. It was just so bland and the veggies on top were raw. I didn't like the raw tomatoes in the dish. The pasta was the only thing which was okay but overall the dish lacked salt. I kept trying to adjust the taste with salt and pepper but nothing worked. My husband enjoyed his Pasta. Had Dark Chocolate Soufflé which comes with Chocolate Bourbon Cream Sauce. This dessert wasn't something I was expecting. It was supposed to be chocolatey since it is dark chocolate but didn't do justice at all. We couldn't finish that.

11/26/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","The Palace Grill far exceeded my expectations with rich, flavorful renditions of Creole classics. In general, the quality of New Orleans cuisine in Southern California is disappointing. I've grown wearily accustomed to greasy breading, frozen seafood and watery plates of jambalaya. No amount of Crystal can mask the flavor of a slimy, canned oyster po'boy.So you can imagine my delight wandering into The Palace Grill for a weekday lunch. Their painstaking attention to preparation and seasoning genuinely reminded me of the French Quarter, with prompt service to boot. They also encourage a bit of excess, with spicy martinis served by the jar and warm terrines of Grand Mariner laced bread pudding.I found their soft shell crab po'boy perfectly cooked, with crunchy, papery shells coated in cornmeal flower. Their crawfish crabcake also features tender chunks of meat in a jalapeño-spiked, lightly breaded cake. Their Oysters Rockefeller is unusual, served in an airy puff of creamed spinach and hollandaise, but satisfying nonetheless. Creole restaurants tend to be pricey and The Palace Grill is no exception. However, if you arrive during lunch and take it easy on the cocktails, you can leave relatively unscathed. A definite must when visiting Santa Barbara, probably deserving of a trip in and of itself.",5 star rating,Karl H.
11/14/2017,"Tucson, AZ","Cajun cuisine in an incredible location means that we are extremely lucky visitors to Santa Barbara.  We were seated quickly in the adorable dining room.  Then our server, Fern, greeted us and made us feel quite welcome.  Festooned in white coat and white slacks, he was professional and efficient in his menu knowledge and customer service.  Little muffins in a variety of flavors were delivered to our table, along with our water.  These delectable morsels were sweet and housemade, and just delicious!  Our wine was then delivered, and we ordered the crawfish popcorn (battered and deep fried crawfish tails with a not-too spicy remoulade.).  Then came the entrees (a little too quick, though).  I had the blackened catfish Ponchartrain style (spicy cream sauce with crawfish), and my husband had the lamb chops with the most delicious sweet and spicy mushroom sauce.  I was a tad disappointed that mine had boiled red potatoes, but after adding a little butter, they reminded me of the side dish I grew up with.Dessert - we wisely ordered the bread pudding soufflé when we ordered our entrees.  With the whiskey cream sauce poured into the middle of it, angels started singing.  Seriously - that good!  Dotted with raisins, its crust was crunchy without being overdone.  So good!We walked to and from the restaurant from our hotel, which was a good thing, as we were so full!

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  Other folks at my table including kids all found something they liked. End result all plates cleaned!The best part of the meal was dessert.  The sweet potato pecan pies, makes you want to slap some body!  And the bread pudding with bourbon whipped cream is to die for. I normally don't eat like that, but that night I went all in with no worry of the intake of fats, calories, sugars and all that other mumbo jumbo.  Just delicious!!!They even had a zydeco band outside at the front entrance with extra instruments for folks to play along.

The restaurant has another bigger room next door for more guests so I guess this place can get pretty crowded. my bf and I went here for lunch bc I wanted to take him somewhere new, and we never get creole food. He got the jambalaya pasta? And I got the Crawfish or shrimp etouffe. My etouffe was really good! Spicy and Cajun, (tbh this was my first time having etouffe, and I've always wanted to order etouffe since I heard it in the disney movie Princess and the Frog, so this was a solid first etouffe) My boyfriend's pasta was lacking a lot unfortunately, it wasn't really jambalaya, but more shrimpy tomato pasta?

Make sure you start with their cajun popcorn- yum! You can't really go wrong with any of their main courses but my favorite is the chicken tchouputoulas, creole crawfish crab cakes, or their filet (order it Pontchartrain style!). Most importantly, make sure to take your waiter up on putting in your soufflé orders. The bread pudding with whiskey creme sauce and/or their chocolate soufflé with chocolate bourbon sauce is where it's at!

(all very good! we took the leftovers home for breakfast the next day).Total with tip is about $80, excellent service! the poppers are the best, i wish i had this closer to home and we could just order these as a midday snack. the Etouffee is heavier than the Jambalaya and i like the dark wine comfort feel of the dish. i would totally crave this on a cold winter. the Bread pudding with whiskey icing is also heavy and delicious, a must try if you like bread pudding.the Weekend evening they have live music outside and it has a lively atmosphere. This is a great spot for any occasion. the funny thing i noted is that the waiters look like they're wearing lab coats, like they all look like serious doctors that make sure you get a superb service. They really make you feel welcomed here.",5 star rating,Jen L.
7/21/2017,"Troy, MI","Food: 2/5 got the stuffed blackened filet and the jambalaya sauce piquante. Would definitely not recommend getting a stuffed steak - wanted to try it out for the novelty but it ended up being a waste of money. Steak itself wasn't juicy, the stuffing didn't taste good either - it was basically shrimp paste. Jambalaya rice was super dry, and overall the dish was way too salty.Atmosphere: 4/5 They gave out sheets with lyrics to ""What a wonderful world"", and had the whole room sing along. Waiters were very nice as well.tl;dr  Good environment for dinner, but subpar food.",3 star rating,Frank W.
8/7/2015,"San Ramon, CA","Visited this place for dinner and was not disappointed with the food. Great service by the staff their attention to detail was good. I wanted to try crawfish but didn't want to waste by ordering a full dish. The bearer was good she quickly realized my plight and offered to talk to the chef to do an 1/2 order. I was pleased by their flexibility and ordered 1/2 order of crawfish and as main dish I ordered lamb chops. The lamb chops came with mashed potatoes, veggies, and mushroom in a sauce. The sauce was awesome. I had the chops medium done and it was perfect. For both orders combined i paid $50 which was on the high side. However, for the location, food, and service this place is worth it. The crawfish was tender and fresh. I was glad to try it for first time and will tell you the meat was a mix between shrimp and lobster.Will visit this place again for dinner.",5 star rating,Suresh D.
7/23/2018,"Tustin, CA","We had a group trip to Santa Barbara and decided to give this place a try. To be fair, the atmosphere and decorations are somewhat above average. However, food-wise is mediocre as most dishes are way too salty. I obviously understand that southern foods are somewhat salty compared to the rest, but this has to be improved. Moreover, gals in group decided to give the ""Souffle"" a try by ordering 3 to share among 12 ppl, bad decision! The cook obviously didn't know what a true Souffle looks like. Please see attached pics for details. I highly recommend ppl coming to this place not to order the ""Souffle"" if you're expecting a genuine one.",3 star rating,sherwin c.

11/16/2017,"Studio City, CA","A great place to stop by for dinner or any special occasion. I went for my birthday dinner. The food is cajun louisiana style. It's delicious. I had the coconut shrimp-so good! My main dish was the blackened salmon with veggies. My salmon could have been cooked a bit longer for middle to be done more. My boyfriend had jambalaya. He enjoyed it. There is something for everyone on the menu. The drinks are well made.  It was a busy Sunday night. The line was out the door. So be prepared to wait. The greeter was nice. Once seated, there was cornbread in a basket to enjoy. The cornbread could be better though. We got a bottle of red wine, The Big Easy Red for $46. It was from Fess Parker winery. Nearby Vineyard. Tasty! There was music playing on speakers. Tables are close together. You will hear everyones conversation. The waitstaff are not readily available. But like I said, it's a busy place.  Later in evening, the waiters pass out a booklet with a ""mystery"" song. You can't open book until music starts. It was Frank Sinatra's ""I got the world on a string."" Everyone can sing along. So funny if you're tipsy. Oh, if it's your birthday, you can get a cool swan Eclair dessert. The bathroom was clean but right near kitchen. There is no parking in front but there is a lot a block over. Other than that, enjoy! Everything on menu are reasonable prices.",5 star rating,Angie D.

Not fresh at all and maybe over cooked.We got the soft shell crab and the inside of it tasted like mush rather than flaky chunky pieces of crab.

8/19/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","We had high hopes with the high yelp reviews. Started with the fried craw fish and seafood gumbo. Both were OK.  Craw fish lacked flavor. The gumbo was nothing to really write home about. Had the punch with rum. Couldn't finish it cuz I don't like Myers rum. We got the divers scallops and soft shell crab main dishes. The scallops were OK but we only got four small scallops. The crab is breaded with corn meal so it was pretty crunch. Flavor was mild for both dishes. We also got the regular bread pudding. Again, lacked flavor. Needed more cinnamon and sugar. Service was nice. I probably won't be back. Gave it  a try but rather try other places now.",2 star rating,Kelly O.
4/21/2019,"Goleta, CA","SO SAD TO SEE CHANGE FROM PAST:Been a die-hard fan of this gem for years...I've always looked forward to bringing loved ones here  for special occasions and we always spare no expense, ordering cocktails and multiple course meals with lavish desserts.     The service, which they understandably have prided themselves for years, has always been this venues shining star.    However, today I had a very sub-standard experience that was so very unusual that I felt compelled to share with hope that their manager will keep tabs on the staff involved so that this treasure does not lose its fan following over time.  I made telephone reservations 3 days ago for today at 2 pm.    Our small family of 3 was excited to celebrate our Easter Sunday lunch after church here.     I had asked the man I made the reservation with on the phone  several days ago to please write a small note on my reservation about sitting by the window.   He assured me he would.  Well, today we arrived at 2 pm and went to check in with this young, blond college-age host.   She said she had no record of my reservation.    I told her that I had made it several days ago.   She looked again and said she was sorry but there was no record.     By now, I'm feeing befuddled and more than a little confused.    She assured me they would fit us in anyway.    Then she looks down at the reservation book and says that she is sorry because she had us already ""booked in under our name.""   She takes us over to a table further away from the window and I see that a very fresh family of 3 people had just been seated at the table by the window.     We have to believe that that was the table reservation we were supposed to have had by the window and the one she admitted to checking some other people in under.     Well, we are not sure if the people themselves lied about the reservation and took our table, or if the girl just crossed us off the list errantly too early.    Whatever it was, we sat at a table that was less than idyllic.    Then that same blond collegiate host ended up being our server and she could have redeemed herself by being personable and friendly and all would have been great (as usual).  However, she did not offer muffins and she just seemed less than genuine or personable.   She rarely smiled and she seemed just in general lackluster and maybe a bit unhappy about having to work Easter?   The young man working was sweet and helpful, but he was not out main server.    The girl waitress said that gumbo bowl was big enough for us to share a bowl.    Given that there were three of us, and that I was just getting over a cold, I asked her if we could have an extra cup to split the soup.  She ended up bringing the one bowl with a tiny tiny cappuccino size cup that she handed me and it had about 2 ounces of soup that she had in it already.  She said that cup was for me.    I'm not sure why the small cup size....not understanding why she didn't just bring a normal empty cup or bowl that we could have split the soup.  To be honest, not sure why she recommended that the one bowlOf soup was enough for all three of us to begin with.  I would have been more than willing to pay for a cup or bowl for each of us, but when she said it was really big, we went with her suggestion.   The food was delicious as always.   Stellar.  No issues with food quality....When we went to leave, there was yet another blond collegiate (super young girl) who was stationed at the exit door and when we went to leave she did not say a word.   Every time I've ever been here the staff had always made a huge effort to smile and say goodbye and ask us about how everything was when we left.   That's just part of their charm.   But, man oh man, not sure if it was because they had all their usual staff off for Easter and were using these super young and inexperienced wait staff, but the staff they had on (with exception of the young Hispanic man) was not remotely of the quality I've grown to expect as the best part of the Palace.   Hope the manager will be sure to keep some more seasoned staff on duty on a major holiday day next time.",2 star rating,Ashley M.
5/1/2015,"Bakersfield, CA","I've celebrated a few of my friends' birthdays here and had a great experience each time. And this particular evening was no exception. To start, the muffin basket is an addictive proposition. The muffins are simply too tasty. For our appetizer, we ordered the crawfish popcorn. The restaurant owner/manager had given out samples of this to would-be diners waiting outside earlier in the evening. The crawfish itself was average but the sauce was definitely the highlight.I ordered the crawfish étouffée for my entrée. The dish was perfectly seasoned and flavorful. My friend ordered some unremarkable Italian-inspired pasta dish...at a Cajun/Creole restaurant - no judgement. The best part of every meal here is the chocolate soufflé. I'm glad I ordered dessert when I ordered my appetizer because the soufflé takes a while - just ask our envious neighbors who could only watch as we destroyed our soufflé.The atmosphere in the dining room is generally lively but maybe too noisy for some. The service was very attentive and friendly. The seating, however, can be a bit cramped. Overall, this is a fun and unpretentious Santa Barbara dining spot.",4 star rating,Ty T.

I didn't eat pieces of bread that didn't have shrimp between them and when all was said and done, I had enough leftover bread to be equivalent to half the original sandwich size. The flavor and everything itself was good. I just felt gypped on the amount of shrimp, especially for the price. Secondly, my husband's entree was supposed to come with muffins, but we never received them, and didn't remember til the end.The flavor of the food was very good. We had the chocolate soufflé for dessert and it was delicious. I would eat here again, but try something else because of the issue with the amount of meat in the po'boy.",4 star rating,Misbah P.

We luckily showed up around 730pm on a Saturday and there wasn't a line. The food is delicious and the plates are HUGE. I got pasta which only had the option of LARGE or HUGE. I got the large and still couldn't finish it.  They give you a variety of little muffins instead of just plain bread to start.  You get two of each flavor which is nice.  I did not order any drinks because we were already going to a bar after dinner.  There were so many choices on the menu that definitely brought me back to New Orleans.  I can't wait to come back and try other items. Sorry the pictures are not very nice because the lighting wasn't optimal for pictures.  The SB Axxess deal gives you a free appetizer with purchase our two entrees.  We had a group of four so we got two free appetizers.   Here's what I got, with attached photos:Cajun Crawfish PopcornIt's like eating calamari! Every bit is full of meat and the sauce is also yummy and not overwhelming. Creole Crawfish CrabcakeThis appetizer is delicious!  It definitely isn't shareable though because there is just one piece of crab cake.  The rice was plain so that was a slight disappointment. Crawfish Pasta LafitteWarning that this dish has creme in it and actually smells very cheesy. I'm lactose intolerant so they replaced the sauce with marinara instead.  The dish was still superb.  There was a good amount of everything:  pasta,  crawfish,  tomatoes,  onions,  etc.",5 star rating,Linda H.

6/2/2017,"Thousand Oaks, CA","The Palace has been one of my favorite restaurants for almost 20 years! They are open from about 11:30 - 3pm for lunch, and then reopen at 5:30pm for dinner. It's a really fun ambiance including restaurant sing-a-longs some nights, and they have a room you can reserve or rent out for large parties - I had the welcome lunch for my wedding here and they really knocked it out of the park and impressed everyone with their service and professionalism and food. The managers and servers are all friendly, efficient, and attentive. Their blackened filet Mignon and blackened catfish are two of my favorites, but you really can't go wrong. Even the chicken picatta is special and delicious. If you're feeling ambitious, get the sampler platter!Plus - the house made mini muffins you're served when you sit down are outstanding - five varieties and it's impossible to pick your favorite - and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce is out of this world! They even have the Cafe Du Monde chickory coffee! The lunch menu is equally as delicious and includes things not available for dinner like flash fried artichoke hearts and beignets...

3/14/2017,"El Monte, CA","Came here with a group of friends for a celebratory dinner. We parked in a structure across the street (first 75 minutes free, $1.50 per hour after). The wait was to be expected for dinner time (think we were told fifteen minutes, but it ended up being longer or maybe we misheard and it was fifty).The service was decent or great (personally, I thought it was average but the concept behind it is stellar). No complaints.Now on to the food:The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. The biggest problem we had with The Palace Grill was the pricing. The prices don't match the taste of the food, in my opinion. My friends were happy with what they got, but overall we thought it was a bit expensive. (Yeah, it was for dinner and this is Santa Barbara, but come on...)The popcorn crawfish was really good, but I didn't expect the market price to make it so expensive. $15 for a starter. Really? I expected $10 at the most, and my friend thought it was $7. The complimentary muffins were also pretty good. I really liked the rosemary ones and my friends each had their own favorites. A friend and I got the jambalaya pasta, which was not bad at all. However, mine literally only had two pieces of sausage and a ton of chicken in it, which I thought was a pretty skewed ratio. Good amount of shrimp, though. Was it worth $19.50? I'm not sure.Another friend ordered the Palace Pasta Royale. I tried some of that; it wasn't that good. Definitely would not recommend that if you don't usually like mushroom-based sauces. My other friend ordered something that had veal, crawfish, and fettucine. The crawfish tasted weird and no one who tried the veal really liked it. The fettucine was pretty good, though.",3 star rating,Fiona Z.

So we started with the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn (recommend) and shared a cup of gumbo and crawfish étouffée plate (recommend). I absolute love these dishes already, but it was my friends first time having any of these. She really liked it here! The popcorn was really good, and the batter was super fluffy and tasty. Dipping sauce was on point. The crawfish étouffée was definitely my favorite. PLUS to the kitchen staff who split our dish in half because we were sharing. We were tempted with getting the bread putting but like I mentioned we didn't want to be too full before our wine tour. So we didn't get it, sadly, and had planned on stopping by after the tour to get some to go before hopping on the train.

5/26/2015,"Henderson, NV","I didn't love it, I'm sorry I just didn't. First of all what's up with the name, it isn't consistent with the food or vibe of this place. I will say to its credit that all of the staff look like they could be from New Orleans. I noticed the female staff were more smiley and friendly than the male staff. They operate on an every staff member helps all sort of concept which can be good or bad. The original waiter wouldn't come around often but he dropped off the check without asking if I wanted a coffee with the two desserts we ordered (I always have coffee with my dessert). He seemed perturbed when I ordered coffee as he tried to drop off the check. I was perturbed that I'd been eating my dessert without the coffee wash down. The Crawfish Popcorn were light and delicious, also were the mini muffin samples that they give you after you order. Our entrees, Blackened Catfish and Blackened Filet weren't so great. Neither were the Chocolate or Bread Pudding desserts that we ordered. The Chocolate lacked in chocolatey ness. If you were in a blind taste test you wouldn't identify the dessert as being chocolate. The bread pudding sauce needed more of something too, vanilla, sugar, I don't know.

Service was friendly and welcoming too. Make sure to make reservation before coming or be prepare to wait. We weren't able to make reservation for the Saturday night so we decided to come by around open time to see. Two lines were already forming by the time we got there (10 minutes before open time)! One on left for those with reservation and on right for those without. We quickly lined ourselves up behind two groups of 2. After all the people with reservations got seated, 3-4 tables were still open and we were able to get seated!We ordered-1) Popcorn Crawfish- tasty but portion was small2) Jambalaya Pasta- mediocre3) Blackened Catfish- not as expected and dry, lacked flavor. 4) Bread Pudding Souffle- served very hot but a little dry. My favorite of the night were the complimentary muffins!",3 star rating,Eva I.
12/20/2014,"San Francisco, CA","Good but not great. I went here for dinner with one other person during a weekend trip to Santa Barbara and tried a variety of dishes. - Complementary muffins: this free ""breadbasket"" starter really stood out from other restaurants'. You get a basket of assorted muffins of all different flavors, all of which were great. - Cajun Crawfish Popcorn: fried little bits of crawfish. I really liked how the batter didn't overwhelm the crawfish and you could still taste the meat with every bite. Portion size was pretty generous. - Blackened Fresh Louisiana Redfish: to be honest, really disappointing. Our server ""highly recommended"" this dish so we went ahead and ordered it, despite the steep price tag. When it came out, I was sad to see that not only was the portion pretty small, but the fish itself was really boring in all aspects. Flavors were bland, texture was meh. - Jambalaya: good, but not memorable. I've had jambalaya of similar caliber/flavor elsewhere, so it did not stand out. Service was good enough. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty festive and they actually handed out a pamphlet with song lyrics, so halfway through the meal the entire restaurant broke out into song (including the customers)... which was interesting.",3 star rating,Jane W.
8/17/2018,"Laguna Beach, CA",Great authentic Cajun restaurant with a very friendly staff. We got the gumbo ya ya which was great. The jambalaya pasta has a lot of flavor and spices which I also enjoyed. The dish that stood out the most was the palace pasta royale which had a creamy delicious flavor that was smooth enough to not be overwhelming. The yelp page also got us a free bread pudding with the purchase of two entrees. A super warm sweet and delicious dessert to end our dinner. Highly recommend the restaurant,5 star rating,Jennifer M.
5/4/2017,"Corona, CA","This place is absolutely awesome!! If you are looking for a place with a truly authentic New Orleans vibe and food with a taste extremely close to the New Orleans taste then this is the spot in downtown Santa Barbara! The chefs here are amazing and really know what they're doing! The flavors in the food was really impressive. I had a cup of the seafood gumbo off the lunch menu for around $7. It was sooooo good! There was so much flavor. My mom ordered the fried catfish po boy sandwich which was also delicious. I normally don't like them because of the bread but this sandwich was perfect! The amount of bread wasn't overwhelming at all. After she added the hot sauce it just added even more flavor. The tastes of food here is so close to the authentic food in New Orleans it's wonderful! She also had some Lemonade which was good and we ordered the beignets for dessert. The plate come with 3 large beignets and was around $5 off the lunch menu. They were good to and served warm. This restaurant adds a decorative chocolate to the plate with the beignets which I've never seen but it was still pretty good. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cool with Marcus gras beads, good New Orleans style music playing in the background, alligator heads around the restaurant and so many more authentic decorative things related to New Orleans. All in all this was definitely a great experience. Our server Brittany was friendly and was very  knowledgeable of the menu. This place is a must for lunch or dinner!",5 star rating,Shannon F.

7/1/2019,"Arlington, TX","This place has been recommended to me several times since I've been in the area. General consensus for the locals is that this place is hands down the place to go to for Cajun flavor. Today I was able to test that theory and though I wouldn't call it ""Cajun"" as I know it, I was satisfied with tonight's meal. I stared off with the oysters, they have them in two options and I had both!....I would suggest you do the same, there were perfect! I was dying to try the fried crawfish appetizer (looked delicious!) but I'm on a diet this week and opted for the red fish....this plate consist of fish, boiled potatoes and veggies. The side of garlic sauce they provide is what made this entire meal in my opinion, that was the ""flavor"". The blackened fish wasn't bad at all, but so small! Yet pretty good! Seemed like a lunch potion, so for the price, that just didn't sit well with me. Also, you can't be a ""Cajun restaurant"" and your hot sauce option is tobasco sauce?! I did however love the decor and ambiance of the place. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone not familiar with Cajun food and I certainly DO NOT mean that in a negative way. This is still a great spot. Awesome staff!! The host was pleasant, the waitress was very nice, knowledgeable and sweet and they made sure our table was always clean. Wonderful service guys!!!

I had the scallops which were tasty, my grandma had the fish which she loved, and my mom had chicken piccata which was also really yummy. I wanted to try their famous dessert but was too stuffed, however they still brought me a little ice cream for my birthday.

It was my mom's birthday and I wanted to take her some place nice and from them greeting us at the door, to the moment we got our food, everything was perfect. So we got the coconut shrimp and the gumbo appetizers. OMG It was so yummy! Especially my gumbo, it was perfectly seasoned. It had the right amount of cajun kick to it, wasn't too spicy. What you notice at the tables is that there is no salt or pepper shakers. Just a Tabasco bottle to enhance the flavors of the food. The chefs strive for perfection in seasoning. I loved that! Our next course: I got the Blackened Redfish and my mom got the Cajun Crab Cakes. OMG both of them were so delicious! My redfish was so moist and cooked perfectly. I couldn't stop smiling as I was eating it! So in the middle of dinner service, they had something alittle special for the ones having special occasions. They gave us a special card that said we couldn't open it until the music started. About 10 minutes later, they start this music and have us open the card. It was lyrics to the song they were playing on the speakers. Everyone sang. The servers and owner it looked like, was cheersing everyone and everyone was so happy, including my mom. That was a huge treat. :)I am not done yet. We saved room for dessert. :)We got the restaurant signature dessert, The Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle. It was a hybrid of both a bread pudding and a souffle. It was so amazing! Piping hot. Right out of the oven. Had a Whiskey Cream sauce. Mmmmm, it was perfect. Had the right raise to the souffle being it was a bread pudding/souffle hybrid. They even brought out a plate that had a scoop of ice cream and it had happy birthday on it for my mom. So sweet of them. :)I know this is a long review. But I can only say great things about this place. From the decor to the food, to the people. It reminded me like I was back in New Orleans again. :)Thank you Palace Grill for an outstanding experience. I will most definitely be coming back again. :)",5 star rating,Joey D.
6/25/2018,"Sunnyvale, CA","The Palace has become one of those restaurants where we HAVE TO visit every time we're in Santa Barbara. The Cajun / Creole dishes are fantastic - try the gumbo appetizer, a bowl of intense Louisiana flavor. The blackened red fish is cooked properly, flaky and moist. Both the crawfish etouffee and jambalaya are good, but I prefer the former. We love the atmosphere of the restaurant, especially when everyone sings. The first time is especially magical, especially after a drink or two and the fresh muffins.End the evening with the proper dessert: the banana foster and key lime pie are both fantastic; try the soufflé if it's a special occasion.",4 star rating,Patrick W.
10/14/2016,"Huntsville, AL","Wow, Cajun Food west of the Mississippi River!!!!  I was in town for business and stopped by on 10/10/16 for dinner.  I arrived a few minutes before they open at 5:30 pm so I stood outside looking at their extensive menu trying to decide what to order.  Being from New Orleans I love good Cajun Food so I hoped this place was going to be good.  I was promptly seated and Jessica was my server.  She was great and very attentive.  They brought a bread basket to the table with five different muffins and butter.  I ordered a bowl of gumbo ya ya as my appetizer. Boy was it good.  Actually the gumbo was some of the best gumbo that I have ever had, seriously.  For the main course I ordered the jambalaya pasta.  I was torn between about 5 menu items and it came down to the Red Fish or jambalaya.  The jambalaya was good but a little different from traditional New Orleans jambalaya.  I am not family with adding pasta to jambalaya; my grandma is probably turing in her grave.  Now don't get the wrong impression, the jambalaya was good, but if you are looking for traditional New Orleans jambalaya pick another item from the menu.  And for desert I had to order the bread pudding shuffle.  This was a fantastic desert with a rich sauce to pour over the bread pudding.  The restaurant is decorated nicely with a New Orleans flare.  During your visit look up at the high ceiling to see the various playing cards decorating the ceiling.  Mardi Gras beads decorate everything and I hear they often had live music outside while you wait.  I understand why they get the high marks on Yelp, they deserve it.  Great place to eat!  My ticket before tip was $44.01.",4 star rating,Bill B.

Specifically she removed a gumbo off the table that wasn't even touched because one of my dinner guests wasn't feeling well. We were going to take it home but the waitress came over while the magician was performing and took it, without asking, before we got a chance to ask her to box it.   Overall it was a good experience and I will be back!",4 star rating,Jennifer P.
8/19/2016,"Camarillo, CA","I really really wanted to be wowed by this place. My favorite food in the whole wide world is Cajun/Creole type of foods. Living in Southern California I don't always feel like we have the best options for Cajun food but whenever I find a spot close enough I check it out. I think this place does a great job of capturing the vibes and essence of New Orleans back in the day, with great service and a friendly appearance yet the food just didn't live up to my expectations.Service: 5 stars, stellar service all around! Sorry that I cannot recall our waiters name but he was beyond friendly, helpful, and attentive. He offered suggestions and checked up on us throughout the meal without issue. No issues there.Food: the most important! Probably 3.5 stars? I feel like most of the items I tried were a miss, nothing was bad, just again, my expectations were too high given the reviews and I know what awesome cajun cooking tastes like.What was pretty good: the pulled BBQ pork po boy. Surprisingly very tasty, bread was great, and the BBQ sauce was awesome. Not my go to usually to order given all of the other Cajun options but it was a tasty treat, a great suggestion by our waiter.Now for the misses: the popcorn crawfish. I was so excited to try this, the pictures looked so good! Unfortunately our crawfish was more on the soggy side not Crispy as you'd expect fried crawfish nuggets to be, I'm not sure if it was the batter that made it soggy or if it sat out too long before making it to our table....not sure. Also the sauce had a pinch of sourness which to my taste buds gave it a ""spoiled"" taste, I think it was intended to have a certain taste given the ingredients I read, but it just wasn't to my taste...Lastly the gumbo was so so. Not bad by any means but not amazing. The broth was more on the bland side, not enough spice...again, for someone trying Cajun food for the first time it may have been not so bad but with gumbo being my favorite dish I guess I'm a bit picky.Overall I'd say this place has great decor and service. The pricing is so so. Given that nothing here really wowed me I probably won't come back. Far better Cajun food in LA I was just hoping to find something as good closer to home. I think this place is worth a shot, some items are clearly better then others. But for me if the gumbo isn't on point then I'm moving on.",3 star rating,Melissa L.

12/11/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Scottie and I cause a scene; chili pepper martinis drip from our eyelids and our beings. Our auras are the color of paprika: red beings and rice. The Palace Grill and their ace cards and Louis Armstrong portraits... we and the Palace Grill are a burgeoned friendship of the highest mandate. We're here with Leine. She doesn't eat meat so we order her fish and I'm so concerned with her liking me back. She receives catfish and says, ""I've been offered to have sex on camera,"" and I say, ""That's a bad idea,"" a little too gruffly because I just met her and my deck is already exposed. Though the Palace Grill is a fine place and it's tough worrying about pragmatism or my own jealousy with the food having arrived. Leine lets me try her catfish. It's blackened and awesome. Scottie and I do our typicals: popcorn crawfish, the fried chicken salad, a po'boy, and red beans and rice. Always bread pudding. We grow louder with each vodka pour. We laugh and laugh. Now, I've been here before. I once fought about whether Christians fundamentally believed that Jesus was the son of God. That was with a different ex. And Scottie was there again sitting silently, forking his chicken when his awkward laughter ceased being effective. I said that he was deemed the son of God, and my devout Christian girlfriend insisted that he wasn't necessarily the son of God and it was a stupid argument fueled by the same wonderful jalapeño martinis. Also, I'm not Christian so it was none of my business other than my own interest in plebeian theology. Nonetheless, the food was great then, too. I've been here for Scottie's bachelor party, having been sick from getting too drunk the night before. God knows the Palace grill was wasted on me then. I took one sip of that perfect drink and excused myself to their restroom with the funny cartoons on the wall, looked hard at myself in the mirror and questioned what I was doing with my life. I've been here too, clandestinely with girls from San Louis Obispo, girls from Oregon, girls I'd met with Scottie in Los Angeles, and if this were a reasonable half-way meeting point or not, I made it imperitive to share it with those I was equally as fascinated with. My fascination for popcorn crawfish or Palace oysters always immense and effervescent. Palace oysters are topped with crawfish and baked. Now, Leine is here, her smile warm as the esophagus after a sizable gulp of my drink. And I can't think of a place I'd rather be. The bread pudding finally arrives.

The place is full of paintings from New Orleans which makes me like the place even more.We Decided to order fried chicken salad, blackened filet mignon and grilled salmon.

Not only did they meet the expectation I had previously set but they surpassed it!What we had and why it was good...Crawfish Étouffée -as good as I remembered, it wasn't over powered by the rice like at other establishments where your rice to crawfish ratio is just not right!  The crawfish was juicy, succulent and flavorful...if you're familiar with crawfish you know how easy for the flavor to be found lacking but not here and not in this dish and the spiceyness was just right!Crawfish Pasta Lafitte -my sisters dish which I just had to taste, I couldn't help it, it literally called to me and I will be having my own on our next visit which I've already decided will be happening very, soon. : ) Back to this delicious dish...pasta was al dente which is important to me: I don't like mushy pasta. There was an abundance of crawfish in a creamy, can't have enough of sauce (see photo for visual).Po'boys...My daughter and my friend each had one; crawfish for my friend, shrimp for my daughter. Neither of them could finish it and both had the other half for later which I was kind of jealous of because I ate all of my dish! Chicory Coffee. I love Chicory anyway, I mean...you get a strong bold flavor without bitterness so how could you not. They serve the coffee with steamed milk on the side so you can make it your way.Overall...In case you didn't get the hint...I am a total fan of this place and not only because of the fantastic food but their staff is pretty fantastic too and not only because I left my Coach shopping bag with three new purses inside which they held and kept safe until I came back but because I have been to New Orleans and can compare the authenticity of the dishes and I've had fresh crawfish and tore the head off and sucked it and have that as a point of reference too so it's not my lack of Cajun/Creole food experience writing this review.Bottom line...it's just great food, plain and simple with a group of quality, honest people providing you with their service. I'm more than good with that!",5 star rating,Irene M.
7/5/2016,"Norwalk, CT","This was our visit to the Palace Grill in Santa Barbara and I am very glad we decided to come here. It was an exceptional meal. The food was excellent, the service wonderful and the atmosphere was very inviting. Everything here was perfect. We ordered the ""All the Best"" platter to share  which included a sampling of Caribbean coconut shrimp, blackened salmon pontchartrain, spicy crawfish etoufee, Louisiana soft shell crabs and the Louisiana bread pudding soufflé. The assorted muffins were a great starter before we received our meal. The coconut shrimp came out first as a starter. The shrimp were great with the marmalade sauce. The rest of our food came on the platter to share as an entree. Each of the items was more delicious than the last. I really enjoyed the crawfish etoufee. The meal was followed by the delicious bread pudding soufflé. It was a great end to a truly wonderful meal. Aside from the food, I was impressed with the overall service and how welcoming the restaurant felt. The prices are reasonable considering the amount of food that you are getting and the quality. Try this place out. You won't be disappointed.",5 star rating,Michael R.
12/8/2015,"San Francisco, CA","I visited Santa Barbara for the first time this past weekend and was recommended to try out The Palace Grill. I'm so glad I listened to this suggestion!My boyfriend and I ordered the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn, Jambalaya Pasta, & Crawfish Crab Cakes. Everything was fantastic and every bite was full of flavor. The Crawfish Popcorn is a great appetizer to share and comes with a yummy dipping sauce. The Jambalaya Pasta had lots of seafood and a nice spicy kick. And the Crawfish Crab Cakes were my absolute favorite. You can really taste the flavors of the crawfish & crab, and the steamed veggies that came with it really balanced out the dish. If you're ever in the Santa Barbara and craving some New Orleans like food, this is your place to go! The staff is really friendly and the decor inside the restaurant is really festive and fun to look at. I will definitely be visiting this place again in the future!",5 star rating,MyTien P.

9/9/2016,"Aurora, Canada","A MUST TRY if you're in Santa Barbara. I came across this place while researching on Yelp. You will not be disappointed. Prior to entering the restaurant, a friendly musician was playing some beautiful tunes on his accordion outside. Very effective marketing. After you step into the restaurant, it does make you feel like you are in Louisiana for Mardi Gras. At first we had a table by the windows but we started to notice there were so flies lurking around and asked to be reseated. It wasn't a problem and the manager & waitress were super nice. The staff was very welcoming and around 7:15pm or so we were handed a little booklet (to be opened once the music started). Turns out it was lyrics to ""What a wonderful world"". All the staff came out and toasted all the patrons. We ordered..Jambalaya Sauce Piquante - This was super tasty. The sausage, shrimp and spices was so flavourful. We could eat this foreverCreole Crawfish Crabcakes - Loved it though after a while I preferred the Jambalaya more. The crabcakes and sauce was great and I loved the veggies and rice with the sauce. Service was excellent and the food came out so quick (10 mins? it was supposedly dead that day but there were still lots of people). We were super stuffed and couldn't order dessert. Their famous bread pudding takes about 30+ mins to make and we were told it's a must try. We would definitely come back if we are ever in Santa Barbara again. WOW !",5 star rating,Rana L.
1/5/2016,"San Jose, CA","This was the first place I ate at when I moved to Santa Barbara for college about 7 years ago..(time flies!!). Such a great find, thanks to Yelp and a few locals. First, the atmosphere is amazing. It's casual and fun. There is lively music and a magician going around inside doing some magic tricks for customers. There were beads and masquerade masks on the walls. Really awesome setting. Second, the food was delicious. Every table gets a basket of cornbread that were different flavors with different dipping sauces. The cornbread comes out hot and fresh. I think my favorite was the jalapeno cornbread. I forget the exact entrees we ordered but I remember they were all flavorful with the perfect amount of Cajun seasonings and perfectly made. A lot of Cajun places skimp on the seafood, such as crawfish, but not here!! Every time I ate here, the food was awesome. Lastly, the service was great. The servers were super nice and also knowledgable. Very impressive. I can't wait to come back when I visit SB again!",5 star rating,Kristine L.
4/22/2014,"Los Gatos, CA","A fun place with great food!It was a Wednesday evening and we were traveling down the coast; it was dinner time when we were in Santa Barbara. Naturally, we consulted Yelp and found a Cajun restaurant with very good reviews.  We were intrigued and decided to try it. We are definitely glad that we found this place!  If only it was closer to home....We were seated immediately.  Fortunately this was a Wednesday and not a weekend, as we later found out that on weekends, the line can be out the door and down the block.  (I haven't seen a restaurant with lines like that since we were at K-Paul's Restaurant in New Orleans many many years ago).It was good to get some delicious Cajun food again.  It's not the very best that I've had, but it is very good, and likely the best Cajun food that you will find for many hundreds of miles, until you get to New Orleans.  I do recommend this place. While reviewing the menu, we were presented with a dish of wonderful muffins, each a different flavor.  They were so good, we had a few servings of them!We started with the Crawfish Popcorn ($14), which were lightly breaded with a cornmeal batter and cooked just right.  There was this delicious dipping sauce that enhanced the flavor. My wife had the Scallops Special ($25).  She enjoyed it very much. I had the Crawfish Etouffee, which was delicious!  The sauce was fantastic!During dinner, the staff distributed song sheets for a sing-a-long, with all the staff and patrons singing ""What a Wonderful World"".  This was a fun, nice touch. This restaurant has a great approach to service. They call it ""Team Service"", where *everyone* is your waiter.  This worked perfectly.  All the staff members seemed to know what was discussed with any one of the staff. Many people tended to our needs in a seamless well integrated manner. This restaurant has the best approach to serving their guests that I have seen.  There was always someone there to assist us whenever we needed.  All restaurants should be run this way!",4 star rating,Mike M.

11/11/2018,"Las Vegas, NV","DONT ORDER THE FILETWent here as a friend was preparing for her Marathon the next morning and needed to carbo load. I on the other hand was craving a nice juicy steak and ordered the Filet Mignon which on the menu states is a ""house specialty"". As the food started to come out, everything looked and smelled amazing. Then, they brought out my filet. I could tell by just looking at it that it was raw. Cut into it, and it was literally cold and raw. Out waitress, Robin, who was very polite and professional came by and I showed her the steak and she immediately took it back. She made a few comments that the chefs refuse to use thermometers and this happens all the time... Seriously ""chef"" if you can't cook a filet you really shouldn't be cooking. And a thermometer? Yea you should use one if you consistently serve raw steaks. Amateur hour. Which is surprising as Palace is a Santa Barbara cornerstone. I'm shocked the health department hasn't caught wind. Anyway, Robin brings back out what I expected to be a new filet cooked to a nice medium. What I got was the same filet I had cut up and it was just re-fired... Anyone who knows anything about cooking knows there is one key element to cooking a nice steak and thats getting a nice sear to lock in the juices. If you re-fire an already cut open raw filet you're just serving tough and rubbery meat. I flagged Robin over and told her this was not acceptable and she agreed and took it away. At that point, the rest of my party was already about half way into their meals so I just didn't order anything else. Long story short, the definition of insanity is making the same mistake over and over again and not learning from it. Apparently The Palace Grill has an issue with Filets and their chef. Lastly, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of effort by their manager on duty to ""make it right"". He never once came over to apologize or offer anything to remedy the situation. Perhaps he thought Robin had handled the situation well, which she did, but come on man, if you're going to run a restaurant step up and own your mistakes and make it right. The restaurant was half empty so it being busy isn't really an excuse here. The Palace has always been a great place to eat if you're feeling that type of grub but the fact that our waitress told me this happens all the time and the chef refuses to do better makes me really worried. If someone who was a bit shy decided to just eat it instead of ""complaining"" they could get really, really sick but yet this restaurant is knowingly just letting this happen...",2 star rating,Scott W.

The palace grill has delicious cajun.  The jalapeno bread muffins are awesome, I couldn't stop eating these.  The crawfish popcorn was amazing as well. To be honest, I was interested in this appetizer because it was a review highlight on yelp, and I have to say, you did not do me wrong.  They were little bites of pure delight! My main entree, the crawfish Étouffée was divine.  I had to keep myself classy and refrain from licking the plate.  Definitely save room for the bread pudding souffle.  In fact, if you are too full, you should still get it.  While I am not one to really spring on desserts because usually I am too full by then, I did not regret stuffing this one in.  The whiskey cream sauce they put in the bread pudding is amazeballs.  Get some beignets too.  Cuz they are awesome.",4 star rating,Pauline M.
1/4/2016,"Alhambra, CA","I'm rarely impressed by a restaurant's atmosphere and food but the Palace Grill definitely delivered. While you wait for your name to be called so you can be seated they have a band playing outside for your entertainment. The wait wasn't too bad for two around 6pm. We sat down and they informed us that they work as a team and we can flag down any waitress/waiter to help us out. They start you with 5 different muffins, if I recall correctly, raisin, jalapeno, banana, apricot and buttermilk muffins. All of which were DELICIOUS! Already sold there. We ordered the Jambalaya pasta and the Crawfish Etouffee, and a bread pudding souffle. All of which were delicious on the palette. During our dinner they passed around a booklet which we weren't supposed to open yet until the music started playing. Once it started playing everyone was singing along to a song and the workers walked around cheersing everyone with a glass of wine. Definitely a fun vibe and delicious foood to go with it. :)",5 star rating,Lisa Q.
5/14/2016,"Sunnyvale, CA","I did come back for the blackened catfish.  How well it was cooked depended on how thick the fillet was in that part of it.  The thick part just a tad underdone, the thin part a bit overcooked.  How you avoid that, I don't know, but really good places do.Also it was only one, not very large, fillet for a rather high price.Comes with potato, but I got rice on request.  They gave me what they said was dirty rice.  As with their jambalaya, it was not like anything I'd seen called dirty rice before.  If there were any bits of meat in it, I couldn't find them.  Instead, it was heavily and strongly seasoned.  It tasted OK when fresh, but I took home part and zapped it the next day, and that did not work at all.But the vegetable that also came with (assorted sliced squash that day) was excellently sauteed.During dinner they played a recording of Louis Armstrong, I think, singing a song, and while this was going on all the waitstaff and front desk staff walked around clinking glasses with all the patrons in the restaurant.  What the heck was that all about?",3 star rating,David B.

The corn bread is decent, but they threw some banana nut bread muffins in the mix that was just weird. The gumbo was the WORST!!!!The gumbo taste like they threw a bunch of vinegar on top and did not have the traditional gumbo flavor because again there were two little pieces of andouille sausage.

2/18/2018,"PORTER RANCH, CA","Was just there yesterday for lunch. Everyone liked it (10 of us, including 2 kids). Casual, well priced food. Complimentary corn-jalapeño and banana-walnut muffins to start. Couple of us had the crab cakes, which were very good, but not east coast style, if you are picky ( these were more like thin patties). They had piece of crawfish in them too, which added a nice flavor and texture. The side of veggies was perfectly cooked - so many places overcook veggies, but not here! Jambalaya was good, but heavy on tomatoes. My son loved his soft shell crab po-boy. Our server offered my mom a ""baked potato"" as a side, but its just plain baked red potatoes, not a potato with sour cream, chives, etc. like you would expect. They shouldn't offer it as a baked potato, or explain its not your usual kind, if that's the case. Had the bread pudding souffle with whiskey sauce and swan dessert for shared family eating. Both were excellent. With a couple of soft drinks, and a cajun martini, our total including tax and tip was $210, which was good for what we got. Excellent service as well.

My boyfriend ordered the regular Jambalaya (with rice) and I got the Jambalaya Pasta. I loved, loved, loved my dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and so were the shrimp. My boyfriend's dish was also cooked very well. Only thing was that both the dishes needed a little more spice for a jambalaya. We'll probably order it with more heat next time. To finish our meal, we had ordered the bread pudding soufflé (you have to let them know pretty early if you want it since it takes 30 min to bake) and it was amazing. It was my first time eating bread pudding or soufflé and it exceeded expectations. The whiskey sauce was perfectly complementary and soaked into the soufflé make for flavorful bites.All in all, The Palace Grill satisfied a craving that other restaurants weren't quite getting.

6/29/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Palace grill is among one the restaurants considered to be a ""local staple"" in Santa Barbara.  Opened in May of 1985, Palace Grill has been the setting for countless birthday parties and anniversary dinners. The ambiance is guaranteed to be a roaring good time on the busiest nights and lively enough even on slow nights. Mention this place to any local and you are sure to see a smile across their face from ear to ear. It's within reason to assume, their smile comes from a mix of nostalgic memories of dinners spent under the signature playing card laden ceiling in the energetic atmosphere with occasional live music and rat-pack sing-alongs. Also safe to assume they've got the typical Santa Barbarian attitude of undoubting loyalty to all things Sb- but don't necessarily consider food at the Palace to be extraordinarily unique or special. That being said, The Palace is just about the only pace in town to get anything close to authentic Cajun food, ( I myself cannot authenticate Cajun food as I have never had the pleasure of tasting the real deal) other than the ever popular, Cajun Kitchen, a primarily breakfast joint.Strong drinks, decent food, great service. About $150 for a dinner for two (2 drinks, one starter, 2 mains, and shared desert) so on the pricey side. All in all this place is a fun and I will continue to go back year after year. The atmosphere, the music and the people bring me back and probably will for 50 years to come",4 star rating,Vanessa R.

4/20/2013,"Fountain Valley, CA","My non-Yelp friends had recommended the Palace.  It took me an extra hour to get to SB from OC.  I hadn't had lunch and was pressed for time before my concert, but the foodie in me decided to risk it so that I could have a decent meal. At 6:55 p.m. on a Thursday night I was seated right away (the restaurant was at 80% capacity).  My server brought me water, menu and table settings.  A minute later she asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I ordered a Tropical Hurricane Martini and a Blackened Louisiana Redfish.  I politely let her know that I was trying to make it to the concert at Santa Barbara Bowl.  She says, ""I'll put that right in for you and put a rush on it.""  A minute later the complimentary muffins come out and 30 seconds after that someone brings my shaken martini with the remainder in an iced mason jar.  It was then that I almost convulsed in shock.  No more than five minutes had passed since I ordered and my fish was already plated in front of me.  WOW. Tropical Hurricane Martini - $8.  If you're expecting pure fruitiness, it's not.  There is alcohol in here and you can taste it.  For those of you drinkers, you'll appreciate that they don't skimp.  For you sippers, maybe you better stick with iced tea or fruit punch.  It's a nice touch that the rest of the martini is served in a mason jar with strainer for you to pour at your own leisure.  The Muffins are addicting.  I was served a basket of five... Rosemary Buttermilk, Apricot, Banana Nut, Jalapeno, and Molasses Chocolate Chip.  I liked them all.  You can always ask for more... they'll give you as much as you want.  Blackened Louisiana Redfish - $29.  If you were thinking of one of the blackened fish dishes, you can't go wrong with this (I'm not that much of a catfish fan, they also do it with salmon).  The fish tasted fresh and was blackened to perfection.  A hint of seasoned crispiness on the outside, but once my fork broke through the fish tender and moist on the inside.  Served with two red potatoes and seasoned and slightly spiced green zucchini, yellow zucchini and carrots.  Highly recommended.  Next time I'll have to come back with more people so that I can sample all their different dishes.  I really wanted the Bread Pudding Souffle but I didn't have time for that.  I also want to tackle the Cajun Martini (served with jalapeno and cherry peppers).  Drinks, muffins, and main course all to my table in five minutes, I finished and paid in 25 minutes and was out the door.  Normally that's not something to be proud of for a sit down restaurant, but given that I was in a rush, the Palace exceeded any service expectations that I could have imagined to go along with the superb food.",4 star rating,Howie C.

We came in on a Wednesday evening, and were seated quickly. I have been waiting to try this place for a while. There are always lines going out the door and the yelp reviews have usually been pretty positive. We ordered the fried popcorn crayfish  (~$13) and while we waited, they gave us a sampling of muffins. Molasses, apricot, jalapeno and a few others. I liked them all but the molasses one. It was really tough, especially compared to the others, which were soft and delicious. I ordered the Louisiana Red Fish (~$28), which was a white fish that had Cajun seasoning. It was tasty and was a healthy option. Mi amigo got the Jambalaya (~$23). He really enjoyed it and let me try it. Gotta say, it was pretty tasty! I think we were both relieved that it met (and probably exceeded) his expectations. He even liked the appetizer! I liked it as well, but it seemed heavy on the breading for my tastes. I can see why this place is so popular. There are nice murals on the walls, sometimes there are sing alongs and the food is pretty good as well.",3 star rating,Kim V.

Both of us had been to New Orleans and enjoy the unique cuisine of the city. We know the food to be flavorful and filling but not exceptionally ornate. The New Orleans dining experience is friendly and comfortable in a familial way. On these expectations, I give it a 5 star since it delivers in those ways. We enjoyed our meal of Deep-fried Crawfish, Plantation Fried Chicken Salad, Chicken Tchoupitoulas and Blackened Salmon. Perhaps next time I'll go for classics like gumbo and étouffée. I like and perform a bit of magic myself and was happy to see a magician doing walk-around entertainment. I understand he's been performing there for many years.

1/25/2019,"Ventura, CA",Visited The Palace for a special occasion very recently.   Has been ten years from my last visit.   Everyone in our dinner party looked forward to our visit.   It is a unique place and is as I remembered.    It hasn't changed apparently I have.    Service was attentive.  The dining room is much too loud.  It is too expensive.  Sampling from our four different entrees found they all tasted the same.   I suspect I will hold on to some nice memories at The Palace but don't expect to return.,2 star rating,L L.
12/18/2018,"Tustin, CA","I've had an ongoing love affair with Louisiana cuisine for several decades now and only rarely have found a good representation of same in So. Cal. So finally last Sunday I ate at The Palace Grill while visiting Santa Barbara and must say I was duly impressed.  The gumbo and jambalaya were respectably delicious and the blackened redfish was outstanding, perfectly prepared and cut thick, very generous portion.  The mini muffin assortment served in lieu of bread was tasty although I did kind of miss some old fashioned French bread.  Apparently they saved that for the fabulous bread pudding dessert, which was so big I took most of it home and had it for breakfast the next day with my morning coffee. Service was above and beyond...our server, Mayra, was helpful, friendly and attentive as were the busboys and gals and Mondo, the manager.  I cannot wait to go back.",5 star rating,Diane T.

At certain times, there will be music playing and sometimes you just want to dance...and eat!Service and staff are fantastic. They are friendly and always greet you with a smile.They give you complementary muffins. I think it is unique they serve warm, buttery muffins instead of stale, day old bread.I have had the blackened filet mignon and the jambalaya. The jambalaya brings me back to my cajun-eating hype days(where I would eat cajun food for days). This is a must try!I have never liked bread pudding, until I tried theirs.

6/12/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","4 STARS FOR THE FOOD: took my mother and my boyfriends mother & family here for Mother's Day b/c we wanted to try something diff. We made a reservation and we were a little late but luckily that wasn't an issue. The food was really good! From the dishes that were ordered Jambalaya pasta had a good spice kick to it, ""All The Best"" for 2 platter was delicious & seriously gave you a taste of everything, New Orleans Pan Bar-B-Que shrimp was soooo good & the sauce it came with was so flavorful, lastly... the Penne Pasta Pontalba was mediocre, not terrible but not anything to really rave about. I've rated overall 3 stars because the service was subpar at best. This place is not cheap and they have a policy where any server can serve and help you but literally after you're seated and they take your order they never come back by the table to check how things are or to refill drinks. As it was Mother's Day I had expected it would be busy but it wasn't packed so I thought they'd be more attentive. They paid the most attention to us when it was time to pay the check and they were closed. Also... they have some weird hours, closing at 3pm and opening back up at 530pm.",3 star rating,Ashley F.
5/29/2017,"New York, NY","I don't eat Cajun food often and I was blown away at the Palace Grill. First time experience:Friends and I ordered popcorn crawfish as the appetizer. It was crispy and pretty yummy. The muffins they gave had interesting flavors- not all were my cup of tea though. For the entree, I got the jambalaya pasta. It was huge and FULL of shrimp, chicken, etc. the sauce was amazing!! It wasn't as spicy as I wanted but that was fine. I couldn't stop eating and wanted more, actually. The pricing is a tiny bit expensive but I think it's worth it for the seafood. Service was great. I look forward to coming here again the next time I'm craving Cajun seafood. :)",5 star rating,Carol D.
8/11/2018,"Camarillo, CA","What a disappointment.  I used to eat here in the 90's and the food was outstanding. I ordered my old favorite jambalaya rice and popcorn crawfish. The jambalaya was an indistinguishable slop of who knows what.  It was so salty that I stopped eating it.  The popcorn crawfish was so thick with batter that it was hard to find.  I was only able to eat about a third of it.  My girlfriend did much better with a salad.There were two really good things. The first was the dessert (5 stars) and the second was the band playing zydeco on the sidewalk.  Besides that, I'm never coming back here.",1 star rating,max g.

To close out the weekend, dinner was at the Palace Grill.  Although we did not have reservations, luckily, we stood in line outside before door opens and, we found ourselves seated in no time.I had crab cakes which were mouth watering. The hubby had jambalaya soup, and according to him was one of the best he's ever had. We ordered chicken strips for appetizers. The kids had steaks and salmon. Oh and let us not forget the mini muffins!!! Amazing!!Similar to other reviews here, you are basically transported to New Orleans. There was a two-man band outside playing music which was quite entertaining.  Oh and do participate to singing along because it is 'a wonderful world' after all.Lastly, our wonderful server played well with my family surprising me with a birthday ice cream platter. They sang quietly- NOT! Felt amazingly embarrassed as all eyes were on me! Very grateful though, truly blessed.Thank you Palace Grill for making it simply special.",5 star rating,Mira L.

This is a different experience unlike any other, and if you want something good that you can't find anywhere else, come to The Palace. Enjoy the ambience, enjoy the drinks, enjoy the food, but never forget the experience, because I promise you, if you come, you won't forget it.  Oysters & popcorn, soft crab & scallops, Cajun cocktail, that's all you need to know, because that's all I could eat (I tried eating more but my stomach wouldn't fit it).

The food is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge, so bring your appetite. The reason for the four stars is, forgive me this may sound weird and petty but the place is ran way too efficiently almost clinical like. It is obvious that most dishes and drinks are  previously prepared. This is not a bad thing just something to point out.

9/1/2015,"Chicago, IL","Wow! The Palace's philosophy is to have the staff work as a team, and do away with a lot of the formality of normal restaurants where one person seats you, another brings you water, a third takes away plates, and a fourth is the only server you can ask for something. Of course those roles exist for a reason, so abandoning them could lead to chaos. The Palace pulls it off, and pulls it off with a big smile. Service was impeccable and cheerful, and our waitress even sat down with us to discuss restaurant recommendations for the next night.The food: phenomenal. The oysters Palace are a creamy, decadent play off oysters Rockefeller and were delicious. I had veal medallions that were tender and perfectly cooked, flambéed in a sherry sauce and topped with crawfish tails, delicious. My girlfriend had a crab cake and pronounced it to be the best she'd ever eaten. But all of this paled in comparison to the chocolate soufflé, one billion calories of gooey deliciousness topped with some kind of fluffy bourbon sugar sauce and surrounded by a welcome message written, not in some kind of Hershey's crap, but molten high quality chocolate you can drag your chunks of soufflé through.

Playing cards all over the ceiling, the wall art was different and the lighting didn't match the vibe, but it didn't bother us, just something interesting I noticed. A few minutes into us being there, all of a sudden ""What a Wondsrful World"" started playing and the whole restaurant started a singing along! Apparently they give you the lyrics on the table and twice a night on the weekends they play it abs sing along and the owner and wait staff go around and cheers each table individually. Very cute and creative. They bring out these bread muffins with butter before the meal. They were fresh and delicious. We ordered the popcorn shrimp to start- delicious!

We got the All The Best Platter to share amongst 4 of us because we weren't super hungry and this was plenty! It came with blackened salmon with crawfish tails, spicy crawfish etouffee, soft shell crabs, and coconut shrimps! It was the perfect amount for us 4. It might have even been too much since we had a late lunch. Everything was flavored well and tasted great!  *One star cause we still had to make room for dessert which was AMAZING! We were joking about what's for dessert knowing that everyone was all full already. Then the waiter comes and asks if we are ready for our dessert that comes with the platter! The bread pudding soufflé was delicious! They even personalized it and wrote for us ""Welcome to the Palace"". Super cute touch!*One star because the service was great!

Strange, she never said goodbye.  Popcorn craw fish was ok, hope I like the batter. The Cajun pasta was tasty but sauce was very thin and pasta ratio was off. The crab and asparagus salad was lacking. The dressing was more honey than mustard and the green were bitter and had to pick a few old pieces out. On the other hand, the crab itself was sweet and delicious. All and all a Bummer.Update,I wasn't confused.

We drove from out of town (San Diego, Bakersfield and la) to meet in our home town for my best friends birthday. We had fond memories of this place growing up and picked it to celebrate. Our group was large and lively, but we were treated poorly and as if being a large group was more of a burden then a blessing to the Saturday night crowd. (The place WAS NOT PACKED) there were two waiters and both failed to take our order for 30 minutes then snickered about our table. We looked at them point at us and laugh making snide side comments. It was so disheartening and disrespectful and we asked why we were not being serviced and they said they didn't think we would be ready because our group was so engaged in catching up with one another. HONESTLY WTF, very assumptive and poor service. Overall the manager felt bad and comped our two meals (yes only 2 ppl ordered, because by the time they took our food order half of the table wanted to leave due to the service and refused to order). It was very tragic evening and we were saddened to see our hometown be so misrepresented by these two people.

2/23/2016,"New York, NY","I've wanted to eat at Palace Grill ever since I started coming to Santa Barbara years ago.  I'm a big fan of cajun food so it's right up my alley.  The last day of my last trip here, I decided to make sure I made it here.  The place isn't much to look at really, other than a bunch of railings inside.  The service was great; a perfect balance of being friendly and efficient without hovering too much.  Yada yada yada, lets talk about the food.As per my aunt's recommendation, I got the jalapeno martini.  It was a generous portion and while it isn't something I would normally order, it was well made and enjoyable.  For a starter I got the crawfish popcorn.  These little crawfish tails came in a big, fried heap that was very enjoyable.  The sherry wine sauce added some needed sweetness to the crawfish and was perfect for dipping.  This dish didn't blow my mind, but it was a very good starter.  I got the jambalaya, which was a traditional preparation (chicken, Andouille sausage, and shrimp).  This wasn't the most amazing jambalaya I've ever had but it was up there.  From the way the chicken in particular fell apart, it definitely had been stewed for long enough.  There was also plenty of the 3 meats which is a frequent gripe of mine.  If the flavors had popped just a bit more, it would've been perfect.  It damn sure was filling though.  For dessert, I got the Louisiana Bread Pudding Soufflé.  This thing was definitely on the sweet side, but it was very unique.  The crispy top of the souffle and the grainy, sweet bread pudding were the perfect contrast to each other; meanwhile the rich, carmely, toffee-like flavors and alcohol from the Grand Marnier run throughout.  The whiskey cream sauce seemed superfulous, but the cream sauce ended up being a good contrast to the rest of the dish.  I'd definitely recommend this dessert, but it was a lot for 1 person to finish.Some people think less of this place because it's been around forever and there are hipper places to be.  But as an outsider who wanted to try it for quite awhile, Palace definitely exceeded expectations.  I was absolutely stuffed and happy walking out of here.  I'll be hitting this again next time I'm in town for sure.",4 star rating,Justin L.

Luckily for my party and I, my friend made us reservations at 5:30 and we just walked past everyone in line and straight to our seats. We were greeted by a friendly waiter and explained how the place operates. Everyone works together so you can ask any waiter for anything and they bring it to you in a moments notice. We started off with the popcorn crawfish and it was absolutely incredible. So good that my end of the table had to get a second plate of them. You have to try these. After the popcorn crawfish came great assorted muffins which were really good too. I had the blackstrap molasses one and it was great paired with some butter. For the entree, I ordered the filet mignon stuffed with crawfish and it was perfect. You must try it. One bite and you will never want the experience to end. Great food mixed with a fun atmosphere and you have a real winner here. Make reservations or if you have to wait, it would be worth it.",5 star rating,Billy M.

It was super flavorful and came with veggies and fried potatoes. I also ordered some wine and our server kindly gave me a taste of a few before, and a generous pour. Other delicious items we ordered: red snapper (mild), cappolinio (shrimp pasta- very tasty), jambalaya (can't go wrong), and filet mignon (perfectly cooked).Wish we had room for their famous desserts- chocolate soufflé and bread pudding.

MY.  FOODGASM.  The portion was massive but I couldn't help myself.  I ate almost the whole thing and then finished the rest at home when I had room again.The bread pudding was delicious as well!  I found out after we left that they sometimes have magicians there or my co worker asked me if they made me sing (I would have knocked a star for SURE if they tried to pull that).  :).

8/4/2017,"Gilroy, CA","We found this place on a trip to Santa Barbara, we were not disappointed! The crawfish crab cake was amazing executed perfectly! I highly recommend trying this, we also got the starter platter for two which was equally good. My favorite was the filet of beef, having the ability to sample so many dishes in one order was something I loved. The only reason I couldn't give that 5th star was the veggies were like warm and service dragged a bit between dinner and dessert. In the defense of the staff it was ""fiesta week"" and I guess they may have been unusually busy? All of the staff were upbeat and friendly as well as attentive to the degree that time allowed. We would definitely come back as well as recommend this place for dinner! This was our first experience with Cajun food and were not disappointed, the menu had plenty of options.",4 star rating,Vanessa D.
12/4/2017,"Buena Park, CA","Travelled to Santa Barbara for Mini-moon with my wife. Searched for good place for dinner and caught this place on radar. We ordered platter for 2 and I want to focus on what we had there.Ambience: 5. Small, cozy restaurant with beautiful interior and fantastic outside view. People looked very happy. We saw a group of people who were having holiday party, a small group who having a birthday dinner, and musicians playing music in front of the restaurant. Also sang ""what a wonderful world"" all together at 6:45pm and it was fun and unique experience.Service: 5. Very happy looking, friendly servers. They were very attentive and service was fast even though the restaurant was really crowded.Steak: 3. It was okay. They did not mess it up or anything but it was not something to be excited about. Just a normal steak but out of everything we had in platter, it was one of the least remarkable items.Fried shrimp: 5. It was great! Very crispy and juicy meat inside. Coated nicely and tasted wonderful. It was the first thing we ate cuz we didn't want the fry to be soggy and it was a great start off the plate.Crawfish: 5. Very well cooked and seasoned nicely and evenly. After eating a steak, I was like ""hmm.. steak is just okay"" and I ate this, immediately said ""they are better with surf than turf"". Other fish(forgot what it was): 4. Sauce on top was really tasty but fish was little bit overcooked. Not too much though. It was delicious as well.Potato/veggies: 3. They were fine. Kind of hard to rate them after eating so much food. We were already full and they turned cold when we started eating them. Might have been better if we ate them hot but we didn't want fried shrimp, steak, and fish go cold while we are eating potatoes.Bread pudding: 4. Hot, mouth melting sweet bread pudding. I am sure many people would love it and give 5 anytime for this delicious dessert. Me and my wife both agreed it tastes way too sweet so it wasn't the best dessert we could get. But again, it's just our personal preferences. I'd also agree if anybody wants to say 5 for this one.Overall: 5. Of course 5. it was such an amazing experience dining there. Had a lot of fun and smiled a lot for the evening. Minor flaws here and there, but no major failure. The culture and ambience this guys provide is really amazing and just for that matter, I would give 5 out of 5 even if food was less impressive. Plus, food was also pretty decent so I'm a fan of this place now. Would love to go back there if I have a chance to travel to Santa Barbara",5 star rating,C.J. C.

Not a place to experience intimate dining as it is rather noisy, however.",5 star rating,Ruby R.
1/24/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Definitely a great place for some great Cajun/Creole food. A bit pricey, but pretty worth it.They start you off with a basket of various muffins -- most of them are sweet, but my favorite was the rosemary one. Definitely eat the molasses one before it gets cold, though, or it'll turn hard as a rock.The jambalaya was definitely a good choice -- flavorful, comforting, spicy -- and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. The seafood gumbo was also very good. It had a really rich, seafood flavor that went well with the in-your-face jambalaya.I got the cajun crawfish popcorn as an appetizer, and though it was definitely worth trying once, I'm not sure I could justify the $14 price tag. It definitely tasted good, but they could have been more crisp. The sauce it came with was tasty, but a bit tame. Would have been better if they added a bit of lemon to the sauce for some brightness and acidity. I added Tabasco to it, and that did the job as well.Mango iced tea was delicious too.Overall, a great experience.",4 star rating,Angelica K.

The system is a little strange since you put your name in but still wait in a line as if it's a first come/first serve deal. Either way, you're going to have to wait.Once inside, the staff were really friendly and our waitress was incredibly attentive. She gave us some nice recommendations, but whenever I eat Cajun food I inevitably get the jambalaya. This night was no different, and I ordered the Jambalaya Sauce Piquante. It was full of flavor and was served differently than I have ever had jambalaya before. Light on the rice and more saucy than I'm used to, but really flavorful. My dining companion ordered the Jambalaya Pasta, which was essentially the same as my dish, just served up with a mighty portion of penne pasta. I preferred the flavors of my dish more, since I think the pasta watered down the jambalaya flavor. Still good, just not as good.Everyone raved about their famous Louisiana Bread Pudding and we just had to try it. Super yummy and a must! They even spelled out ""Welcome to the Palace!"" in chocolate syrup on the plate. So nice!I'd highly recommend The Palace Grill for a nice evening out in downtown SB.

For you vegetarians- if you're there for lunch, their flash fried artichoke sandwich is the best and for dinner the mardi gras primavera is good. And if it's your first time there be sure to order the bread pudding soufflé! You can also ask your server to bring a basket of muffins to your table (I think it's free but I guess I never really checked). If you're into baking, buy their recipe book! They don't take reservations so if you're there over the weekend you might have to wait but that's ok because they have live musicians playing and pass out a ton of free food.

I felt pretty underdressed since we just came from the beach, and the majority of patrons here were middle aged and wearing formal attire. Casual my ass, Yelp.I couldn't choose between the jambalaya and the gumbo while ordering, and our waitress looked impatient and didn't offer much help so I went with the jambalaya. My friend got the chicken tchoupitoula. I didn't think our server made any effort to even seem friendly which miffed me a bit.Both our entrée's turned out alright. I didn't find the chicken outstanding and don't know why it's so highly suggested. A bit chewy and sauce way too heavy. I liked my jambalaya much better, it reminded me of the jambalaya I had at Mother's in NOLA. The chocolate souffle was definitely the highlight of our meal though :)In short, his place earns the ""bourgeois"" stamp from me for being overpriced and not reflecting the true culture and environment of the food they serve.I appreciated the seemingly authentic decor and the card tricks butPalace Grill just didn't itch my scratch for some good ol' fashioned NOLA cuisine.Still on the hunt!",3 star rating,Jenny Q.

We asked about the playing cards on the ceiling, and our waiter was kind enough to explain the magician which performs on Fridays, and his act which involves the cards.

6/24/2018,"Toronto, Canada","Was in Santa Barbara with my husband for just one night, and could not have picked a better restaurant for dinner. I mean, words just do not do justice to the food experience we had. Fernando was our server, and he was fantastic, but all the staff we interacted with at the restaurant were stellar. They share the serving load so you can ask anyone in the identifiable white jacket for help, or a drink refill, or whatever you need and they're happy to help. So there's ALWAYS someone around if you need something, which is awesome.I ordered the ""rare - a real treat"" (per the menu) Louisiana red fish (not always in stock at the restaurant so we were lucky that it was available when we went), and my husband ordered the jabalaya pasta. Both dishes were SO FREAKING GOOD. I don't even like fish. I don't know why I ordered the red fish but I would eat that light, flaky, perfectly seasoned fish every damn night of the week if they would make it for me (and if I lived in Santa Barbara, which, alas, I do not). The Jambalaya was the perfect blend of pasta and meat (chicken, sausage, shrimp... does shrimp count as a meat?). Spicy enough that someone who doesn't really do spicy enjoyed every bite of hubs' plate that he let me steal (but hey, I also said I don't eat fish - this place made me break ALL my rules), and tabasco was also on the table if you wanted to add extra heat.We ordered the bread pudding souffle for dessert. If you are on the fence about dessert, throw all your cares out the window and order this dish. It comes with an AMAZING whiskey cream sauce that I could have probably just drank from the rammekin if we hadn't used it all up on the souffle. Takes 30 mins to bake though so you have to order when you order your main dish - so you're committing from the beginning. DO. IT.Honestly one of the best (maybe THE best?) meals I've ever had in my life. I do not know how I'll ever top this... I guess the only solution is to move to Santa Barbara.

If you are coming in on a weekend evening, make a reservation or come right in at 5:30pm when they open before the tables are taken up so you don't have to wait. -Muffin basket (complimentary) - There are 5 mini muffins they give you before your meal. Comes in different flavors: apricot, rosemary, jalapeno, molasses, Banana walnut-Popcorn Cajun (market price) - highly recommend! There's around 30ish crawfish tails fried in flour. Comes with a great  sauce. -Palace grill pasta - ($18.50) A steak pasta with cheese. A little too cheesy for my taste. -Crawfish etouffe - ($22 or $23, I forgot!) This was one of the BEST etouffes I've ever had. Lots of crawfish tails. Also has grilled zucchini, carrots, and squash. -Bread pudding ($9) - Delicious but I got pretty tired of eating it after a big dinner. Comes out piping hot! It's also a fun restaurant to eat in.

This is one of the rare spots to get it, and we absolutely love the food and the ambiance! We usually come to celebrate a birthday or anniversary but this year we brought our 2 teenage kids with us so they could experience it. I had the Palace Pasta Royale which was a first for me and it was Amazing!!!! The sauce was so flavorful and perfectly creamy. We had a bottle of the Fess Parker ""The Big Easy"", which was recommended by our server, Louis, and it was the perfect pairing. My husband and son split the larger sampler with blackened salmon, soft shell crab, crawfish etoufee, and coconut shrimp and they loved it! We also had the crab cake appetizer and it was fantastic! To end it all, we had the bananas foster. What a treat!!Louis, as well as all of the other staff who helped us, was so friendly and created a great experience for our family!

11/30/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I would recommend The Palace Grill if you're looking for good food and a top-notch dining experience. I came into the restaurant around 1pm on a Saturday, right before the singing started. They passed out song lyrics for Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" and as the song was playing/people were singing, the servers came around offering cheers with their glasses. It was a really happy, carefree atmosphere that definitely put us in a good mood to enjoy our meals.For food, we ordered the gumbo ya ya to start. The gumbo was warm and hearty and I only wish I could have more of it instead of it being just a starter. I then had the chicken tchoupitoulas which was generously coated with a unique, creamy sauce that brought the whole entree together. It comes with a side of rice and vegetables that tastes pretty normal, though. I also tried a bit of the jambalaya pasta my friend ordered which was very smoky and hearty, similar to the spices in the gumbo. Overall, the food was good.What made this place special for me was the attention and service that the workers showed. Maybe because I'm used to dining in LA where service can either be a hit or a miss, the servers at The Palace Grill seem genuinely happy to see and talk to you. Combined with the cheerful atmosphere of singing, everyone just seems more happy and relaxed, making the dining experience more enjoyable and the food taste better.Overall, if you're looking for a fun place to eat in downtown Santa Barbara, I would recommend checking The Palace Grill out.",5 star rating,Myha N.

5/19/2016,"Newport Beach, CA","This restaurant is a well oiled machine with a relaxed atmosphere that belies its exacting attention to Cajun cooking at its finest. The singing waiters, the generous portions, and the attentive service all comes together in harmony. I had the stuffed soft shell crab, stuffed with -- wait for it -- more crab!!! Yummy! The highlight was the bread pudding soufflé that was beyond description. If I had to be critical of one thing it would have been that the breaded crawfish was a little doughy and not that flavorful. However the oysters Rockefeller with Béarnaise sauce was outstanding. The scallops were done to perfection and... Did I mention the desert? Orgasmic!! If you are looking for something different this is the place.",4 star rating,Terry K.

7/26/2010,"Torrance, CA","I came here with a big group of friends for a late dinner. We all loved it! There's so many interesting things about this place that are unique from other restaurants:FOOD: raginnnnn' CAJUN! Instead of bread, they give you these mini muffins in a basket with flavors like jalapeno, apricot, molasses, buttermilk, etc with a buttery spread. Pretty dang good! As for food, the 7 of us shared the cajun crawfish popcorn appetizer which came with a really yummy dip, crawfish etouffee, catfish, jambalaya pasta, and the penne pasta pontalba. All the food was pretty good but my faves by far were the crawfish popcorn and the etouffee. Those were the dishes we didn't have any left over of!DESSERT: You MUST get the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle! It comes with a cool Grand Marnier whiskey cream sauce on the side that the waiter pours over the piping hot souffle. If you love bread pudding, you will love this. If you love desserts that mix hot & cold temperatures, you will love this. If you're an alcoholic or whiskey lover, you will LOVE this! The cream sauce tastes straight up like whiskey. SERVICE: The waiters look like pharmacists in their white coats. :D Service was overall really friendly! But we didn't really have one set server. You just kinda ask anyone walking by for whatever you need. I guess that works here because the place isn't too big.RANDOM FUN FACT: I don't know how often (maybe every couple hours?) they do this, but when we were there towards the end of our meal, they passed out little laminated song books that said ""Do not open until you hear the music begin..."" on the cover, and once the music started, we flipped it open to see the lyrics to ""What A Wonderful World"" inside complete with cues to toast your glasses and shake hands! And the waiters walked around singing it with all of us and toasting with us too! Sooo cute! :)",4 star rating,Diana I.
2/15/2011,"Orange, CA","Had Valentine's dinner here with the bf. Fortunately we made reservations because when we stepped in there was a sign by the entrance that said they were only taking reservations tonight.We arrived 15-20 min. early but were seated immediately. The place was crackin' but the service was still great. The staff was very friendly and even the hostesses would mingle with all the tables.As soon as we were seated one of the servers brought out complimentary mini muffins. Too cute for words but was a perfect way to start the meal.There was a Valentine's day 3-course special going on: 1st course:Infamous crawfish popcorn: it didn't blow our mind but it was pretty damn good. The batter wasn't too heavy and the sherry wine sauce complimented the flavors of the popcorn quite well.Oyster palace/oyster rockefeller combination: did not regret it at all. The flavors were spot-on! Such creamy goodness.Second course:Chicken tchoupitoulas: the chicken was moist and the sauce was pleasant. The dish came with a side of dirty rice and vegetables. The rice was too soft. Could've done without it.Crawfish pasta lafitte: the sauce was very creamy. I hate pasta dishes that are so dry and completely covered with shredded cheese but this was very appetizing. I was already full after eating half of my meal.3rd course:Louisiana bread pudding souffle: orgasm in my mouth! That's how good it was and not a single crumb was left behind!Dark chocolate love souffle: too much chocolate for my liking but still delectable in every way.Aside from the great food, the ambiance is unbelievable. If you plan on dining here it's quite a lovely experience.",4 star rating,Rachel V.

Bourbon cream sauce and somechocolate syrup to accompany it as well.  All blended well imo.Moist inside, rather hard outside ... not too sugary or overdone.My only knock here is that the outside was perhaps TOO hard?Eating it with just a dessert spoon proved to be a bit challenging.(Note to dessert chef:  Easy up a lil on the heat or time in oven.)*** I can't wait to ret'n to try their FL Keylime pie.  That's rare. ***",4 star rating,Barry W.
7/31/2013,"Culver City, CA","Busy, busy place for a Saturday night. Recommendations highly recommended.As for the food, it was alright for Cajun food. I've definitely had better in Texas and Louisiana. First of all, the cornbread was more like bread than the crumbly drier cornbread that I like from my days in Texas. The popcorn crawfish tails were probably more batter than crawfish, but it was still tasty enough since it's fried. The etouffee was a bit disappointing since it just wasn't as flavorful or chunky as what I envision a flavor bomb etouffee to be. The bread pudding souffle was ok - I didn't really ""get"" the souffle part of it as much as just the traditional bread pudding part. Personally, I thought the banana fosters were way better! I did enjoy the banana fosters and would get that again. The portions aren't big like Cheesecake Factory big, but they aren't too tiny either.",3 star rating,Char L.

I got the pasta with more crawfish on top for my entree and damn I forgot the world around me.thats how good it was!Tip :order the souffle' when you order the main dishes because it takes about 30 minutes to make. The souffle' here is totally bomb.warm,fluffy,creamy and soft on the inside.It's served with a white wine sauce and vanilla ice cream mmmmmmmThe decor is also very southern with pictures and paintings of jazz musicians all over.It's smack in the middle of downtown santa barbara so park in the parking complex right across from the restaurant or you won't find parking.",5 star rating,Alex T.

And the service is fantastic and fun - near the end of our meal they broke into song and took turns toasting all of the guests.The food was quite good, but if you're not careful you'll end up eating a ridiculous amount of heavy food.

7/22/2015,"San Francisco, CA","Overall, this was an okay choice for dinner.What I liked best:  the muffins A variety of mini muffins came to the table in place of bread. I especially liked the blackstrap molasses muffins; they were excellent.For dinner I chose a salad and an appetizer as I wasnt starving. The gumbo was pretty spicy and it was fine, but not amazing. I ate maybe half of the portion. The salad had spiced pecans and a mustardy vinaigrette and was pretty good. I finished that.Other diners seemed to be eating giant portions of fried food and seemed veryhappy. I generally want -but don't eat- a lot of fried food, so I think cajun was probably a poor choice for me. Teenagers would be thrilled to eat here.It was not so quiet inside so this is probably not the place for you if you're looking for a quiet meal. Also, just outside there was live zydeco music. Service was fine and the staff pretty friendly. I don't think I'll be back as this didn't turn out to be my kind of place, but it definitely had things to recommend it and would be a good choice for those of you who can consume large quantities of delicious fried food.",3 star rating,El B.

I had the jambalaya pasta, which they fudged my order on, but corrected it very quickly. House muffins (instead of bread) were a terrific appetizer, so no need to order anything else.

I don't know, we might have just been lucky. ;)The food, oh wow! We overate like crazy, it was just all too good! We got the ""popcorn"" which was excellent and then just before our entree arrived they gave us song books and the entire restaurant broke out in song and the entire waitstaff went around and toasted glasses with every patron!

It says it's for two but honestly we're two huge eaters and we couldn't finish that beast.And the cherry on top was the dessert of chocolate souffle with whiskey cream sauce. Decadent.

For an appetizer we ordered the oysters. You will not regret trying these!For dinner I ordered the Jambalaya (not the pasta but the rice dish). That was delicious as well. The environment was warm and lively. I especially enjoyed the music! The man playing the zydeco played ""What a wonderful world"" that added the 4th star for me.

5/31/2014,"San Diego, CA","A+ service!  A+ food. My husband had the soft shell crab and loved it.  He cleared his entire plate (as did I). As for my barbecue prawns--they were delicious. The sauce was incredibly flavorful for just being described as ""barbecue"" and I don't think I've ever tasted shrimp as fresh as in this dish.  Don't forget to cut under the shell for that extra bit of tender fresh shrimp and squeeze that lemon wedge onto each bite. My bayou greens salad with creole dressing was delightful. Light and fresh with dressing that tasted light as well but graced my palate with so much depth.The initial bread basket was filled with small muffin creations--jalapeño, molasses, rosemary...I can't remember them all.  Delicious. Homemade lemonade was perfectly refreshing and complimented my meal. My husband had 2 glasses of red wine -- I believe it was Fess Parker's -- called the Big Easy, for his hefty meal. He enjoyed that very much. And it ended just as well. We were celebrating a special occasion so they surprised us with the dark chocolate soufflé. To die for. A creamy delicious sauce was poured over it once delivered and carefully opened up with spoons by the waiter, and thick, rich milk chocolate for dipping spelled out a special message around the platter. Amazing food. Amazing service. Give thanks back with a generous tip. We will definitely return.",5 star rating,Beatrice S.

My favorite dish of the night!  The inside was so light and the batter wasnt overpowering.  The spice sprinkled on top of the dish gave it a good kick.  The accompanying sauce was AMAZING!!  My husband said it was the best thing of our meal.  Haha.Jambalaya pasta-  very hearty, flavorful, and filling!  I wish they used wide noodles instead of penne.  This dish was good but a bit too salt and not spicy enough.  A good mix of shrimp, chicken, and smoked sausage.  Bread pudding souffle- definitely a looker of a plate!  The presentation was beautiful and I saw that a lot of people ordered it.  Our awesome waitress asked if we would be ordering dessert at the beginning of our meal.  She informed us that it takes about forty minutes for the souffle.  Nice tip to know!  The bread pudding souffle wasn't really a souffle... it was very heavy and was really, just bread pudding.  It was good but I would probably try their chocolate souffle next time around.  The whisky sauce on the side is delicious!  They offer a complimentary basket of cornbread muffins.  We only tried two and was hoping to take the rest home to try.  But they whisked it away when they took our dishes without asking if we would like to keep them =( Love the group singing and toasting during the meal!  Very fun atmosphere!  You must try this place if you're visiting SB!",4 star rating,Tiffany C.

Feels like eating clams or mussel instead, and the natural juices from the oyster is also great.We also had the red beans & rice & Jumbalaya and those were good too.This place has an interesting painting of a big African American musician dressed in white, where for whatever reason, there happens to be a playing card (I think it was a king of spades) attached to the top right corner of the painting. Found that interesting, I didn't ask about it though.It was also cool that they serve customers as a team, so each customer is not assigned to a particular server/waiter.The one bad thing about this place is that the restroom happens to have some artwork that's sexual in nature (at least has nudity) that's not suitable for kids. There was also some framed comics on display that were humorous but geared towards adults in sophistication of content.You can see some photos that describe what I'm talking about here.",4 star rating,David L.
4/20/2009,"East Bay, CA","I came here with a friend for lunch on a Saturday. From the reviews already on here, I expected it to be a full house, but apparently dinner is much more popular.We started off with the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn appetizer, which we both loved. The crisp is nice, and so is the creamy sherry wine sauce it came with.When we ordered, our waitress asked if we would like to order their special Bread Pudding Souffle for dinner (since it takes 15 minutes to bake, we were told). We said yes, and then I ordered the Jambalaya Sauce Piquante, while my friend ordered the Chicken Tchoupitoulas (thankfully God I'm only typing this review because I have no clue how to pronounce that out loud).The Jambalaya dish I had was good, but my one complaint was that there were almost no Andouille sausage, which I was looking forward to. Still, I enjoyed it.My friend liked his chicken entree, but I didn't really care for the sauce it came with when I tried it.The bread pudding souffle with whiskey cream sauce came out, and I wasn't blown away by it like some of the other people that have written reviews, but it was pretty good, particularly the sauce.",4 star rating,Sara L.
11/21/2010,"Stoughton, MA","After much debate as to where to go for lunch, I overheard the word cajun and convinced my family that we should head there for lunch. There aren't many cajun restaurants in Boston after all, and this would be more fun than Italian or Mexican. From the moment I stepped inside the place, I noticed the New Orleans feel that it had. From the hanging balconies that hung from their ceiling to the Cafe du Monde-branded items, and the alligator head in the corner. It screamed cajun everywhere we looked but without looking tacky, weird or overdone. Instead it was a nice, fairly quaint atmosphere. We promptly ordered fried artichoke hearts to share as an appetizer and I got myself an order of seafood-free Jambalaya. I actually found out, after inquiring about it, that their lunch-menu Jambalaya is fish and seafood free, unlike their dinner one. Perfect, I obliged.As for drinks, I decided to get a traditional Cafe au Lait, which is coffee blended with some chicory and some milk. It came instants later and was great. Good depth of flavor and smooth as well.The artichoke hearts were quite tasty as was my jambalaya. The Jambalaya was spicy, not too rich and had bits and pieces of sausage in it. It was actually pretty good, much better than I expected. We thought about desert but weren't hungry at that point and decided to step out instead. The service was phenomenal and on top of their game and the prices were more than affordable. The place was clean, not too loud and well maintained. This was a great lunch and a place that I'd love to return to in the future when in the area.",4 star rating,Jeremy K.

We actually just ended up coming here because the other place we wanted to try on our last night visiting Santa Barbara said their kitchen had just closed when we arrived. I am so glad that that first place was closed.My dad was born and raised in Louisiana, so we visit frequently and I grew up eating his cajun cooking. I love cajun food. My boyfriend is Cuban/Mexican, so it is always fun to see how he reacts to eating the delicious southern food. He enjoyed everything at The Palace. He said he was full, and continued to nibble. We both couldn't get enough. All of the staff, the host, busboy, food runner, and two servers that we encountered were all very nice. I noticed that they all worked together as a team to keep the customers happy (I notice these things because I manage a restaurant and that is exactly the type of thing that makes dining out a wonderful experience. So to whomever it concerns: you're doing a great job and so are your employees) :)Overall, I would definitely return the next time I am in town and I hope to be able to bring my dad along next time :)The prices were actually very reasonable for what you get. My boyfriend and I each had a non-alcoholic drink, shared an appetizer, shared a ""huge"" pasta dinner and a dessert for $50. We both thought it was a great deal. Needless to say, we had quite a bit of leftover and left in food comas.

2/11/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Boy, do I dislike Palace Grill's food. I've dined here several times at the encouragement of my family members and out of town guests and each time I have been disappointed. Palace Grill is to cajun food, what Chilli's Bar & Grill is to mexican food. Exactly, not comparable! Everything that I have ordered is drowned in salt. Apparently, that's all you need to call it cajun food. Perhaps I'm spoiled because I lived in Louisiana for a few months and had real cajun food on the regular. The dishes they are serving up at Palace just don't hit the mark in my humble opinion. I do enjoy their cocktails, on the other hand, and their bread pudding. If' you're just drinking, eating dessert or don't mind a little hypertension, Palace Grill is your place! The atmosphere is quite lively and colorful which is a nice treat to some of Santa Barbara's more sterile dining ambiances.",2 star rating,Danah W.

7/23/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","OMG what a find!! This place was pretty good. Even though we walked from the other side of downtown Santa Barbara, we made our way to this restaurant because we saw the ratings of this place and had to try it out. The ambiance of the place is very Louisiana style. If you look up on the ceiling you can tell that magicians come in to entertain the crowd because you see a bunch of cards stuck on top of the ceiling. We came in and ordered the Gumbo, Cajun Crawfish Popcorn, Jambalaya sauce piquante, Beignets, and Louisiana bread pudding soufflé. I think we were a bit too hungry. But we ended up finishing the whole thing. They also gave you complimentary muffins with butter with your food. The gumbo wasn't too much. it was light and not salty, and it had so much flavor. You could taste the sausage and the rice was perfectly made. The crawfish popcorn was very fluffy, and you can taste the crawfish. I think the batter was what made the whole popcorn. The sauce that came with it was pretty good too. I wish it had more flavor, but I guess they wanted you to taste the crawfish. We split the Jambalaya, which was a good idea because it actually came out to be a good serving for both of us. It came with the Jambalaya and veggies on the side of the plate. You saw and definitely tasted the wholed tomatoes on the Jambalaya. The veggies were cooked just right. The Beignets and the bread pudding! o m g! they were both so good. We ordered the beignets because the bf never tried beignets but the waitress recommend the bread pudding and we devoured it even though we were full from the food. The frosting and the chocolate in the soufflé was so perfect.The place was definitely good eats. We got to try different things because we shared it together. I would want to go back if I was in the neighborhood again. This wasn't the most authentic Louisiana cooking, but it did do well for it being in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Sarah C.
5/16/2016,"San Leandro, CA","Went here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed!  Drove over 6 hours to get to SB and after dealing with issues at our hotel the last hour, we were just anxious to get some food in front of us.  We were seated right away and ordered a few drinks.  Margarita on the rocks for me and my bf had the martini- both were very good. We ordered their crawfish appetizer and the bread batter they used was so delicious!  The sauce compliments the dish well too.  For our entrees we had the ""All the Best"" platter for two- it included salmon, coconut shrimp, soft shelled crab, crawfish with rice and veggies.  Hands down one of the best meals we've ever had!  Everything cooked perfectly and the portion size was huge.  Would definitely recommend coming here if you're in town!",5 star rating,Sheila Z.
2/22/2015,"Fort Collins, CO","How have I never reviewed this place?!? One of our favorite restaurants when we lived here, and we try to get a night here every time we visit. The Palace is amazing... The staff might recognize you after you haven't been there for a year, and still remember your usual order. It is always busy on weekend nights, so you'll have a 20-30 minute wait outside, but they often have a small band playing requests on the sidewalk, a propane heater if it's cool out, and the occasional tray of appetizer samples being handed out. Once you get seated, your server will usually mention that they do team serving, so you can stop and ask anyone for or about anything and they will happily help. The cajun martini is not to be trifled with. It has too much heat for me, but the hubby loves it  it comes in a pint or quart mason jar, and they will only serve you one. And heat aside, it is pretty amazing. You can't forget about the muffins. Once you get seated, the crew will bring a basket of perfect fresh mini-muffins in a half dozen or so flavors. The key is figuring out how to not eat one or two of every flavor because you know you have food coming. (Ask them to pack the leftovers in a doggie bag... Not a bad quickie breakfast tomorrow morning!)We almost always order their signature crawfish-stuffed filet mignon with Ponchartrain sauce (their cajun take on hollandaise), which comes with somehow spectacular sautéed veggies (they seem so simple, but nail them every time) and cajun mashed potatoes with gravy.  If you just can't handle that quantity of food, the blackened catfish comes with the same veggies and is also fantastic. If you're going with a crowd, definitely get one of the soufflés for dessert. You have to plan ahead some, as they are baked to order and require 20 min or so, but you'll never be disappointed. And now you have to figure out how to roll out of the restaurant, and start reconsidering your plans for the rest of the night because you're so full you can't stay awake!",5 star rating,Beth P.
7/31/2017,"Palo Alto, CA","Went here a second time with my family, and it was even better than I remembered. I got the jambalaya again, and definitely do not regret it. The redfish was also amazing. Complimentary muffins keep people happy before the mains come out, and the dessert soufflés are legendary. The service is also top notch. Honestly I have no idea why I didn't give this place five stars the first time, but they definitely deserve it. I'll be back soon for another birthday.",5 star rating,Michael A.
1/25/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","I read the great reviews and I expected more than what I experienced.Ordered cajun crawfish popcorn, red beans & rice, jambalaya sauce piquante and New Orleans beignets.Cajun crawfish popcorn ($8.95): bland and chewy; even with the sauce.  I was expecting a crispier and tastier dish.  Red beans & rice ($4.25): kinda bland too but the 2 tiny slices of sausage were good.Jambalaya sauce piaquante ($9.95): yum and flavorful.  I added some of this to my rice & beans to add flavor.New Orleans beignets ($3.50): the worst beignets I've ever had.  They were hard outside and undercooked inside.  They were generous with the powder sugar though.  I ate two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  What a waste!!The rice & beans and jambalaya came with jalapeno muffin (bland) and banana muffin (yum).  I didn't order the famous bread pudding souffle but that was supposed to be super good.  Tell them in advance if you are planning to get the souffle because it takes 50 minutes.The service was great.  The host and the waiter/waitress were ALL super nice.3 stars!!The Palace Grill is almost yummylicious!!",3 star rating,Maggie C.

7/25/2015,"Studio City, CA","The Palace Grill is why we go to Santa Barbara. Forget the food - though you can't because it's so great - for a moment, it's the service which puts The Palace Grill over the top as our ""go to"" restaurant...We live in Los Angeles and have a multitude of great restaurants to choose from, but nothing can match The Palace Grill.Last night, Friday, July 24th, we had dinner at The Palace Grill. Errol, and this is why we truly love The Palace Grill, welcomed us so very warmly and made sure we got the best table possible. Our friend Keith was working a wedding party but made a point of stopping at our table to say ""hi."" Fernando our waiter, treated us as if we were VIP special guest and was very attentive to our dining needs. And the entire staff treats all customers as if they're special guests. What's not to love about that level of service?The food, of course, is wonderful. We started with Gumbo Ya Ya, then Diver Scallops for my wife Laura, and the Chicken Tchoupitoulas for me. And, of course, we had the muffins, which if they're not, should be world famous. We ended our dinner with the Louisiana Bread Pudding Soufflé, which is to die for. Seriously.The Palace Grill is a dining experience you won't soon forget. And, for us, is why our friends - from both Los Angeles and out-of-state - always ask us, ""When are we going to The Palace Grill again?"" It's a worthy question and one we can answer, ""Not soon enough.""Yes, we love The Palace Grill that much.Jake and LauraStudio City, California",5 star rating,Jake J.
10/10/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Honestly, the one star is for our servers who really tried their best to make the experience nice but the food was just God-awful, on all levels, mostly due to the lack of quality ingredients and desperately needing a chef who truly understands New Orleans/Creole food preparation and how to coax flavors out of the dishes being prepared.  After reading the many reviews here, was excited to order the Etoufee which was bland, and the shrimp/scallops were desperately over-cooked.  The rolls/muffins they give to start also tasted very ""flour-y"", dry, dense with no real flavor.  Even the butter didn't help.  The souffle they needed 1/2 hour to make was actually very dense, uninteresting bread pudding.  We mostly left our plates and walked out hungry and dissatisfied.  I've spent time in New Orleans - this is nothing like the wonderful food there.  Skip it.  Much better choices nearby.",1 star rating,Westside L.

The scallops were by far the highlight of my night, perfectly seasoned and perfectly buttery! Then the service! Loved the little song midway through our dinner when we each of the servers came to our table to cheers with us. The only reason actually that I'm giving 5 stars is because I wasn't a huge fan of the bread pudding. I was definitely hooked in when they said that we should order sooner if we wanted to get that because they take 40 minutes to make. I would have probably been upset if we'd waited an additional 40 minutes for that, but instead I was just underwhelmed.

My friend LOVED the cajun crawfish popcorn and thought it was the best part of the meal. I thought it was really good too, with great sauce to dip it in! It came really fast so we were able to enjoy it while waiting for the other dishes. Yummy!The seafood gumbo was delicious as well! It's very flavorful, with a lot of seafood and a good portion of rice inside. My friend, on the other hand, thought it was too salty and didn't enjoy it as much. I also thought the portion was going to be a lot bigger, not just that small bowl. The Jambalaya pasta was pretty yummy, but it didn't stand out too much to me. It seemed like a typical pasta dish that I would be able to find in a lot of different restaurants. The entrees also came with complimentary mini muffins. The flavors were there, but they were incredibly dry.So overall, we had a good meal, good food. But I honestly don't think it was worth the price that we paid.

12/3/2012,"San Jose, CA","The Palace Grill came out as highly recommended by one of my colleagues who went to school in Santa Barbara. We decided to check out the restaurant on a Friday for an early dinner. We reached the restaurant a few minutes before they open for dinner and were shocked looking at the long lines that were already formed even before the restaurant opened!There were two lines, the one to the left was the one with people who had reservations and the one to the right was the one with people who did not have reservations. We were lucky to get seated soon without reservations.We were immediately served complimentary muffins, they are fresh out of the oven - warm, fresh and fluffy. There were different varieties of muffins and one of those was jalapeno. I have always thought muffins are supposed to be sweet and was enthusiastic about trying  a spice one. Loved it. My friend who has no resistance to spicy food found it to be too hot.We ordered Cajun Crawfish Popcorn and Gumbo Ya Ya for appetizers. For entree, we got Jambalaya pasta and their signature steak (House Specialty Stuffed Blackened Filet Mignon). The steak came with veggies and mashed potatoes, was phenomenal! As my friend raved about their Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle, I couldn't wait to try it. Ohhh, freshly prepared and sooo delish! The dark Chocolate Souffle turned out to be amazing too.They sing songs every hour or so and the waiters handed out the song lyrics to all of us. All the waiters clinked wine glasses for a toast with each of the restaurant patrons. The vibe was so energetic.The decor was in line with the Cajon/Creole style in Louisiana.

It's so cute.I get the crabcakes with crawfish with adds a little something extra to standard crab cakes. My boyfriend got the lamb and it was seasoned perfectly and very tender.

The Crab Cakes had way too much filer and the Craw Fish had way too much batter; some of the pieces were just deep fried batter! For my main course,  I ordered the Soft Shell Crab. Again, there was way too much batter and hardly any flavor to the crab. My friend had the Craw Fish Etouffee. He told me there was very little Craw Fish in the dish.

They were able to bring us over right away, before several large parties that had already been waiting, and funnily commented, ""Aren't you glad you don't have friends?""The basket of 5 mini muffins were enough to fill us up so we had to be careful to not eat them all before our meal arrived. We got the fried catfish, the gumbo ya-ya, and an appetizer portion of their scallops. The scallops were my favorite. The appetizer portion comes with 2 scallops and a side of some risotto. Wish I had gotten the full entree size as the gumbo was a bit too salty for my taste :/ Didn't eat much of it and felt bad as the majority had gone to waste. The catfish seemed small for the price, but it was tasty.Small quip: why does a Cajun/Creole restaurant only have Tabasco as their hot sauce? There are so many other great hot sauces you could be offering!Of course they did the sing-along towards the end of our meal, which secretly was my whole reason for wanting to go.

I ordered Cajun Crawfish Popcorn and shared the large dish that cost $75  with my boyfriend (soft shell crab, blackened salmon, crawfish etouffe, potatoes, and coconut shrimp). I thought the Cajun crawfish popcorn could be a little more crispy, but it was pretty good and the sauce was flavorful. For the $75 dish, they ran out of blackened salmon so we replaced it with the crab cake.

And for there to be GOOD Cajun/creole food is a rarity. We were seated and given our appetizer, the Crawfish Popcorn within 10 minutes. SO good- personally, I prefer it without the sauce, I felt it didn't even need it. Moving on to the entrées! The jambalaya!! GET it! If you've been to New Orleans and appreciate that kind of jambalaya, not the nonsense that somewhere like the Cheesecake Factory offers- GET it! I will let you know, that if the previous sentence is true for you, ask for some pepper and tabasco, it's definitely lacking that creole/Cajun ""kick""  Dessert was a tough decision.

There was nothing jambalaya about it. I'm not even sure there was any sausage, because if there was they must have ground it up so finely I couldn't see it. I ordered the chicken tchoupitoulas. Skip it. They have more flavor at el polo loco. The rice and vegetables that came with it were good, but the chicken lacked anything special. It was blah at best.

8/10/2010,"Albany, CA","2 stars for food, 2 extra bonus stars for service, ambience, and a fun atmosphere overall. This is definitely a ""must-visit"" when in SB. The whole experience-- from the guy in front jammin on the accordion, recommending cajon martinis and beckoning folks in... to the neon lights and diner-esque feel... to the super-friendly and accommodating waitresses... to the surprise Black Tuesday Mardi Gras beads and sing-along (complete with copious ""cheers"" and drinking)... this was pretty awesome.The food was all right. To be fair, I'm not a huge cajun food fan. And, I prefer a plant-based diet and this place wasn't the most veggie-friendly. However, the cooks did accommodate to my steamed vegetables request with ease, which was fantastic. Boyfriend enjoyed the bread basket (really buttery, petite muffins - banana walnut and buttermilk were the favorites because they were served warm. The others were colder and quite tough-- molasses, jalapeno cheddar, and rosemary). Blackened catfish was not-too-shabby and served with buttery-dill vegetables (seasonal squash and carrots) and one roasted red potato. The most awesome part was the cajun martini. Served spicy with 3 full jalapenos and shaken on the rocks in a glass jar with a filter, the menu specifically states ""one per person"" for good reason. The jar itself serves at least 4 and it's pretty potent!Bread pudding souffle was just ""ok"". It tasted like the muffins in the bread basket, to be frank, and was quite buttery as well.It was worth the trip!

Lots of Cajun spice, not my favorite food but we enjoyed they experience, They have big craft vodka spiced drinks that seem to be a hit but we did not have any after a day of wine tasting. I probably would not return, Service was great with Anne as well.",4 star rating,Richard N.

11/11/2017,"Orange, CA","Fantastic Cajun food. Feels like you're eating right off the streets of New Orleans. The Jambalaya Pasta was filling and the perfect amount of chicken and shrimp. The popcorn crawfish was delicious as well, perfect for a starter. The banana bread pudding was out of this world, some of the best I've ever had! Tasted like banana bread cinnamon crumb cake. Everything was extremely good and an overall great experience!",4 star rating,Alix F.
8/27/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","I've been coming to the Palace since the 90s and actually celebrated my 40th here (a bunch of family and friends hired a limo and drove up from LA, which allowed us the luxury of drinking as many Cajun martinis as our livers could handle). The place is fun and slightly rowdy, but with consistently amazing food.The atmosphere of the Palace is casual and equal parts funky and hip.  It's a place you visit when you're in the mood for some lively merrymaking rather than a quiet, refined fine-dining experience.  I'm a Jazz fan so any place that has a New Orleans vibe, pictures of Satchmo on the walls,  and Jazz standards on the sound system gets my vote.  But the great vibe is just the icing on the cake;  The food is where the Palace really shines.Let's start with the drinks:  Even if you're not a martini fan, you have to try either their Cajun martini (served in a Mason jar with Jalapeño peppers, not olives) or their Tropical Hurricane martini (sweet and made with mango, lime, and cherry infused vodka).  Either way you'll thank me (and you'll order another round).Along with your drink order, ask them to bring you their version of Oysters Rockefeller (topped with their Cajun Hollandaise).  I love Oysters (raw or baked) but even if you're not a huge enthusiast, these will blow you away and possibly even turn you into a fan-boy.After you order your drinks, they'll bring you a basket of home made muffins, still warm from the oven (they bake them continuously). They're pretty addicting;  I like the molasses and the Jalapeño cornbread.  Both are awesome with the Cajun martini.As far as main courses go, their menu offers quite a few choices. If you've never eaten here before and aren't sure what to order, go for one of their platters, which are sort of like Cajun Tapas. They easily feed two people and allow you to try multiple items without spending a fortune.My GF and I always order ""The Palace"" platter, which includes blackened catfish, blackened NY steak with Cajun Hollandaise, coconut shrimp, and their Chicken Tchoupitoulas (pronounced ""Tchoupitoulas"").  They also include seasoned potatoes and vegetables as well as their bread pudding for dessert (but you can substitute any other dessert for it).  This plate-O-awesome will leave both you and your date smiling (and stuffed).As far as the desserts go, the Palace is somewhat renowned for their Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle (served with a Whiskey cream sauce), which is certainly delicious, but a bit too heavy for my taste.  I usually opt for the Palace Swan, which is basically a profiterole in the shape of a swan, floating on a lake of warm chocolate.  The presentation is pretty cool and will satisfy your sweet tooth (and impress your date!).The service here is top notch and unique in that they don't assign a single waiter to each table.  Instead, every server in the house is basically your waiter and you can ask any of them for anything, anytime.  I know it sounds a bit chaotic, but it works surprisingly well.  The management and staff here are true professionals and seem to pull it all off without even breaking a sweat.At least once an evening, they do a ""What A Wonderful World"" singalong (they pass out lyrics in case you've been living under a rock and aren't familiar with it) and each of the staff stops by and toasts everyone while Pops serenades the room.  It always leaves me grinning, with a strong desire to go outside and hug complete strangers.  Some nights they also have a roving magician who will do a few card tricks for you (hence all of the cards stuck to the ceiling of the place).  Both are nice touches that make the evening just a bit more special.One caveat to eating at the Palace:  They are ALWAYS packed and only accept reservations for 5:30pm on the weekends.  There is usually a line outside for the poor souls without a reservation, but in the Palace's typical friendly style, the manager will usually offer some free popcorn shrimp to the hungry patrons in the queue.  I suggest making reservations or getting here early;  If you waltz over at 8pm, you're probably looking at a 30min wait for a table.My GF and I used to live down the street (literally) from the Palace and whenever we had family and friends stay with us, we'd always take them here.  We also ordered more than our share of takeout and would occasionally swing by on our way home from an evening on State Street to pick up some muffins for breakfast (which they almost always would just give us gratis, even though we offered to pay).  Note that they also sell the recipes for their muffins for a nominal price;  My GF still occasionally makes me the molasses and cornbread muffins on weekends, which always take me back to SB and our many good times at the Palace.Long and short:  High quality classic Cajun cuisine with a fun, raucous New Orleans vibe.  A bit of Bourbon Street on the California Riviera.  Highly recommended.",5 star rating,Michael L.
9/2/2017,"Whittier, CA","To say that I was impressed would be an understatement.  The food, the ambiance, the staff was just mind-blowing!  We took a chance and it paid off royally.  We started our dinner with a delicious quintet of savory and sweet mini muffins (complimentary), had the fried crawfish as a starter, I had the circa 1875(?) pork chop with the maple glaze and my husband had the jambalaya.  We could not stop raving about the food!  Then in the middle of our dinner the restaurant broke out in song singing what a wonderful world sung by Louie Armstrong as the staff went around clinking glass with the patrons.  It was an incredible meal all round.  We have decided to keep coming back to taste all of their other deliciously sounding dishes they offer.  Palace Grill has become our new go-to venue when in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Tina E.
4/4/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Who dat say you can't get great Bayou food away from the gulf? As soon as you step in the restaurant the scintillating smells of bread pudding and savory Cajun  spices will swarm your senses. The sounds of Duke Ellington accompanied by happy harmonizers singing along will make you wonder if you just arrived by street car. The Cajun Jalapeño Martini is a must, not too spicy, not too sweet. They serve it to you in a fine glass adjacent to a mason jar which you can continue to help yourself to for a remarkably low price. The Craw Fish Poppers are a staple and the Sea Food Gumbo is packed with flavor to start you off. I enjoyed their unique entree of a creel crab cake which is complimented by crawl fish inside the cake. The food is amazingly fresh, full of flavor, and drowning in richness. A friendly staff makes it's way around to cheers you as other table goers of various diversities celebrate their fine food drenched in the festive atmosphere. The only stuffiness in this place is from the intoxicating aroma of their famous bread pudding, which you must request at the beginning of your meal.  No one is over dressed, so put on your most colorful hat and enter ready to jive!",5 star rating,Collin C.

8/13/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","palace/palis/Noun:  1. The official residence of a sovereign, archbishop, bishop, or other exalted person.   2.  A large, splendid house.  3. A fantastic restaurant loosely based on the famous K Paul restaurant in New Orleans OK I don't know why they came up with the name, but the food is good!  It is Damn good!    When I meet people who are visiting Santa Barbara and they ask me where they should eat.  I say the Palace!   How could I not give it five stars, it is my default, my go-to place, the pat answer.     And not just because the food is great, it is just a wonderful dining experience!!!    From the appitizers you get if you are waiting in line, through the music that is outside you are having a good time and you aren't even in the door yet!    The hostess will greet you warmly and the wait staff will treat your right, guarnteed!    I am Scottish and will almost never order an appitizer, but you can't do that at the Palace.   You have to order one or you are doing yourself a dis-service.    And a drink too.   They serve the drinks in pint sized mason jars (for the small ones) and are big enough to share.    The Cajun Martini is the bomb so you might want to go with that one.   Sometimes it can be spicy... but the peppers in the glass aren't and are quite tasty.     For entrees I would suggest something blackened.  If they have the Redfish (and they usually don't) you should try it.   When we went there on Saturday I had the redfish and my friend had the catfish.  We both ate half of each, the catfish was delicious but the redfish was a little bit better.  I have had the filet mignon, blackend, stuffed, with special sauce on it.    Another great dish is the CHICKEN TCHOUPITOULAS (Pronounced ""Tchoupitoulas""), it's just fun to say.  My wife had the crayfish cakes.   Delicious.    When you order you will be posed with a question.... ""Will you be ordering dessert?""  Don't think about it, just say Yes.    They ask you ahead of time because it takes a while to prepare (or maybe they just want to to commit before you eat so that you order before you are too full)  But even if you are stuffed you wont regret your decision, the bread pudding or chocolate suffle are both GREAT!   A final treat is the roving magician who is there on Friday and Saturday (maybe other days too...)   I am pretty sure that there are 10,000 people still trying to figure out how he does some of those tricks...  The Palace kind of has a reputation for being a little pricey, really it isn't.  All of the entrees are $15-$24 which isn't high at all.  The bill is big because you just can't help but order so MUCH!!!    The food is that good!  So I go to the palace, stuff myself silly and I think to myself,  ""what a wonderful world!""",5 star rating,Douglas M.

I got the stuffed filet and it was probably better than any filet that i have had from any of the fancy steak houses out there. Tried a friends pork chop and it was good but the sauce was very sweet.

Came here on a Monday night on the recommendation of a friend and the wonderful Yelp reviews and we couldn't have picked a better place! All the servers were friendly and knowledgeable, and service was impeccable. Food was delicious: crab cakes, jambalaya pasta and jambalaya with dirty rice. And the muffins that they serve ahead of the meal are to die for - 5 different kinds and 2 of each, so TEN muffins for the 3 of us! Each one was better than the next. The highlight for me was in the middle of the meal, they give you a folded piece of paper that says ""don't open until you hear music"", and then all of a sudden, the music begins to play and the whole restaurant joins in singing and each waiter comes by to ""toast"" you. So fun. Very memorable dining experience. Wish we lived closer cause I can't wait to go back!",5 star rating,E M.
4/16/2013,"San Jose, CA","3.5Overall a good dining experience. They only take reservations for the first seating at 5:30pm. Thereafter, it is first come first serve. OYSTERS PALACE - Not sure if this is ""unlike any you've ever had."" I was expecting more jalapeno flavor, so that was disappointing. It tasted very creamy and like a seafood dynamite you would have at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Wouldn't order again. CRAWFISH POPCORN -  If you like crawfish, then this appetizer will make your tastebuds happy. It was pretty good and the sauce is savory. Enough to share between 2-3 people. REDFISH, which is comparable to snapper fish. It was good and I really enjoyed the freshness of the fish. I have come to believe that cajun food is pretty much dousing your dish in seasoning. With that said, my fish was good and moist, but the flavoring wasn't spectacular. JAMBALAYA was good, but didn't leave me wanting more and more.I tried the Cajun Martini and boy will I never order that again. It is exactly what the description states, chilled vodka with a kick of pepper. You'll probably have enough with just the pint. I really like the cherry peppers that came with the martini, I asked for extra and just chomped them with my Redfish. Not spicy at all. Portions here are perfect, not too big. Very good service. Honored our coupons (2) for our party of 10 for free bread pudding! Oh about that, it tastes like a cinnamon.",4 star rating,Anna S.

I found the page for The Palace Grill and knew that one of the people I was traveling with was a fan a Cajun food so we decided to give it a go. To be completely honest, I know essentially nothing about this sort of food or the area/culture it comes from. This was in no way a detriment to my enjoyment, however, and I can say this is some of the best food I've ever had. Would highly recommend the crawfish etouffee and any of their excellent desserts.

While up in Santa Barbara for a conference with six coworkers, I  recommended having lunch here - with a warning that it would not be a cheap business lunch, but well worth the price. Well it was not.  This was the first time at the Palace for each of my coworkers, and only one thought the meal was very good. While the service is still the best, the chef now cooking did not seem to care that he undercooked the potatoes, over cooked the fish, and sent out cold veggies! I know the style of cooking they used to offer and this was not even close. We had no alcoholic drinks or even dessert but the bill came to over $155 for an ""average"" lunch as they automatically included a mandatory 20 percent tip due to the large group.  Best part of the meal was the flash fried artichoke appetizer.",3 star rating,Victor V.

The soft shell crabs are fantastic.  The red beans and rice at lunch, while simple fare, are probably my favorite.I wouldn't define The Palace as fine dining, but instead as a robust, colorful journey best had with friends in a local, happy environment--exactly what you'd expect from a local landmark.",4 star rating,Matthew S.

For appetizers, I ordered the crawfish popcorn and there were complimentary muffins of various flavors(all so moist and delicious!).  I think the crawfish popcorn is a must have and its definitely big enough to share with one other person. My friend said he wouldn't mind ONLY eating the crawfish popcorn for dinner. Anyway, I ordered the salmon. It was cooked very well, pink in the center and juicy. My friend had another fish. Steaks are available as well, but I recommend the seafood.One of the most interesting things about this restaurant was that, at a certain time, the entire restaurant sings a song!

I'd recommend one of the two delightful sampler dinners for first timers.In terms of service, we were greeted immediately at the door and served at our table by a fun and wonderful waitress. Our food came out quickly, and any of our dietary needs were met without question or resistance. It really felt like they wanted us to enjoy our dining stay.Now the ambiance of the Palace Grill is quite magical. The other diners can be heard enjoying their night with the nice mood lighting gives it a playful feeling.

1/10/2015,"Poway, CA",I have tried several dishes here and everything has been great. I had the jambalaya pasta - delicious! I got the large order to share with my friend... and it was enough for a ton of leftovers! We also had some kind of crawfish appetizer - yum! I have also had their signature dessert which is a bread pudding type thing. It didn't sound appealing but was actually fantastic! Service was great - all the servers were attentive and friendly. The environment is very entertaining. I took family here when they were in town from out of state - it was a lot of fun! I would definitely recommend it.,5 star rating,Janine K.

My favourites are the muffins, Louisiana bread pudding souffle with whisky cream sauce, and the excellent Palace Cajun Martini served in a mason jar!

1/27/2015,"Fresh Meadows, NY","Having never eaten authentic Cajun/Creole food, I had to stop by this place on my way to L.A. from S.F. Walking in,this place had an authentic Louisiana feel, as the decor inside is full of paintings of instruments. My friends ordered the ""all the best"" platter, which I picked off of.  I, myself, got the jambalaya and I was not disappointed! The softshell crabs were my favorite, and the jambalaya was not too salty. The seafood was cooked perfectly, and they were not cheap with the amount in jambalaya!My only qualms about this place is that a good part of the menu is fried, which is fine for you people that don't mind, but fried food, besides making me feel guilty, gives me an upset stomach. Also, a lot of the desserts are covered with powdered sugar, which makes everything much sweeter than it needs to me, so be sure to request without it",4 star rating,Angela C.
7/31/2015,"Simi Valley, CA","My wife and I drove with our infant daughter all the way to Santa Barbara from Simi Valley today so we could eat here. I had eaten dinner here once before and loved it. Today we tried their lunch menu and were equally as delighted. They make a burger with garlic sauce that is fantastic. Their pulled pork is delicious. And of course, their bread pudding soufflé is to die for. To top it off, the service and management were on-the-ball and eager to please.I am not a seafood fan but there are several non-fish items here to please you.A must-visit restaurant if you are in the area. The prices are cheaper at lunch, but the ambience is enchanting at night.

She was energetic, fun, and extremely knowledgable.  My party of 6 felt welcomed and enjoyed our time from the moment we arrived... And absolutely looooved singing with the other diners. We didn't have a reservation and this place gets packed tight. But it was recommended that we arrive in between 645/715pm for the shortest wait time possible. We were told the wait would be between 20-30 minutes, but the wait was much shorter than that. That was great!! We started with the Cajun crawfish popcorn (I think I have the name wrong) it was so delicious!! It was accompanied by an assortment of breads, all of which were great! Although I was practically full, I managed my way through half of a large service of crawfish pasta (wrong name again). In short, this was a wonderful was to spend my last night in Santa Barbara!!

Every member of the waitstaff was attentive.The complimentary 5 flavors of muffins for dinner are delicious.Flavors are great, especially the crawfish popcorn and jambalaya. The bread pudding souffle was amazing - especially when done a la mode (ice cream comes with chantilly cream).Portions are a bit small for what you pay, so you feel a little bummed when you see your entree/appetizer but the flavors almost make up for it.There was a totally random sing-along to Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" during dinner with the waitstaff coming around toasting/cheering you after each verse.

So far i tried jambalaya, filet mignon steak, scallop dish, soft-shell crab from this place.

We went around 6 pm on a Saturday night and there was about a ~20 minute wait. Per the server's recommendation, we ordered the crawfish popcorn and the crawfish etouffe and both were DELICIOUS. The crawfish popcorn ($10) comes with this a creamy wine dipping sauce and the tails are not too heavily battered. We shared the etouffee and this comes with little bits of crawfish tails with the most delicious shrimpy red sauce. They split it for us in two plates and we were stuffed by the end of the meal. I don't eat Cajun/Creole food often so I'm not sure if this is ""AMAZING"" according to Southern standards, but I give 5 stars for a tasty, filling, meal complete with GREAT service. Seriously, their hospitality is out of the ordinary and noteworthy of recognition. ALSO, I try to stay away from the bread/muffins provided at the beginning of meals but the little tiny muffins they give with the honey butter, zOMG.

11/13/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","I get that this is one of those places in SB that you just have to go to, but I was a bit underwhelmed and thought the fare was a tad on the pricey side. All in all, still had a good time, great ambiance, friendly service, and convenient parking.The soft shell crab entree at $30 was decent, but they could do better on presentation. The plates serve proper, filling portions, but they're so small! The plate leaves no space to push your food around - so cut that crab and the rice is spilling over the edges. The side of veggies was delicious.The large jambalaya pasta at $18 tasted great and was certainly more than enough for 2 people. Should have just ordered that and an appetizer, in retrospect. Most of the muffins were good (some a bit dry), but seriously - save room for your entree and dessert! At around +$60 for 2 excluding alcohol - pretty much what you'd expect in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Joan H.

Our favorites: popcorn crawfish (yummy dipping sauce), crab cake, crawfish étouffée, blackened catfish Ponchitrain, pepper martinis, and the bread pudding soufflé with whiskey cream sauce (a MUST!). The bread pudding soufflé was recently written up in Sunset Magazine as one of the best desserts in the West.

6/15/2015,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I'm sure the food is good but I never got a chance to eat it. There was a major miscommunication from them about reservations so when we showed up for a bachelorette party/dinner we were sent away without any chance of being seated. Basically, since it was UCSB's graduation, they were ONLY taking reservations instead of what they normally do on weekends which is first-come first-serve after 5:30pm. However, I was told on the phone that it would be like a normal Saturday night and we could show up and wait. Had I known better we would have made other plans. I'm not unreasonable but if you tell me I can show up to get a table and then send me away that's pretty disappointing.What made me write this review was everyone's attitudes about the whole thing. I didn't actually expect them to seat us at that point or anything. The person on the phone was rude and then the hostess treated us like we should have known better - even though I had called days earlier to confirm the seating situation! This is the bride-to-be's favorite restaurant and she was so sad that we were sent away. This wasn't some crazy bachelorette weekend - we just wanted to spend the day in SB and have a nice dinner. This was supposed to be the highlight of the trip.I see from other Yelp reviews that plenty of people have planned special occasion dinners here so I really hope this was just a one-time bad experience for me.",2 star rating,Laura D.

I'm not expert in Cajun cuisine but I can tell you that it was by far some of the tastiest food i've had in quite some time. The portions of sausage and shrimp weren't as much as i'd like but far from lacking. The taste was unique and great... i'd go back just for that dish.The bread pudding dessert was good although you can honestly pass on it. I was saddened that they only served beignets only during lunch... Our bill for two people was fairly pricey but we did have an appetizer, shared main course, dessert and my wife had tea.

A bit tacky but fun if that's your cup of tea, but quite frankly, if there's anything that impressed me about the food, it was the variety of muffins, which isn't saying a whole lot.I came here tonight with some family from out of town who wanted to try Cajun/creole cuisine. To be honest, I'm writing this review while lying down as my stomach isn't feeling too great.The food...Crabcake: a lot of filler, and quite mushy. It fell apart when I picked some up with my fork. Aren't they supposed to be a little crispy?Coconut shrimp: only three shrimp for $10. The sauce ""tastes like marmalade.""Diver scallop main dish: four and a half scallops on the plate. What happened to the other half of the scallop? The scallops lacked flavor/seasoning (even though paired with a sauce).Crawfish pasta: the pasta and crawfish were swimming in sauce. I only ate half and fished out the crawfish.Soufflés: first off, I'm a pastry chef trained in Paris. Calling these soufflés are an insult to anyone who can pronounce the word. Soufflés are supposed to be light and airy, you lightly puncture the soufflé to pour in creme anglaise. Our server had to break them apart with two spoons. The bread pudding soufflé was doughy and undercooked in the center. Our server graciously offered to replace it as he agreed it was mushy, but we passed. The chocolate soufflé was overlooked and hard on the outside as some other reviewers mentioned. There was little chocolate flavor and the bourbon sauce appeared to be the same as for the bread pudding soufflé with a little chocolate syrup mixed in. Please just call it bread pudding and chocolate cake. Tacking on ""soufflé"" is just misleading and disappointing to anyone actually expecting a soufflé.",2 star rating,Diana P.

I ordered the Gumbo and Jambalaya and was stuffed.  One more thing, must order the bread pudding!!!",4 star rating,Sunny K.
1/25/2015,"Reno, NV","My husband and I were planning on stopping in here for a Po' Boy that he was planning, but disappointed when we got there for dinner and realized : they don't serve them for dinner time! Oh well, we didn't give up and came back for lunch time the next day and we were glad we did.My husbands Shrimp Po' Boy was excellent as were the house made cornbread muffins that come complimentary with your entree. The banana ones are a little weird because they are sweetish- and don't seem to go with your meal, but trust me eat them anyway because they are tasty. I had a salad with chicken, romaine, ranch, and bell peppers. I generally enjoyed the salad but it left me wanting a little more variety, perhaps some onions or a larger lettuce variety? The service was unique and very well orchestrated. Basically all servers in the restaurant are your server. They work as a team. This is a model I have seen elsewhere but rarely seen it perfected. I think here it was done quite well. However, when a large party arrived all three servers seemed over attentive to them and slightly forgot about us, but this was resolved soon once they had the table settled and their orders taken.Be wary of when you arrive. This restaurant has limited hours : open specifically during lunch time, then reopens for their dinner time. I imagine they are quite packed at these times. My husband and I arrived 2 minutes after they opened for lunch, two tables were already seated. Within 30 minutes, the restaurant was full! So make reservations if you can, we were there on a weekday in January so if they were that busy then, I think they are capable of getting much busier!",4 star rating,Jaide M.

Try the stuffed filet it never disappoints.",5 star rating,Christine V.
3/17/2015,"Vista, CA","The service was good but we had the shrimp étouffée and we were really disappointed. My step dad is from Lafayette and makes the best étouffée I have had. The stuff the palace puts out is sub par. I'd like to think that the reason why is because they didn't just make it when I ordered it and it has been sitting in a pot all day but I don't think that is the case.  The only other negative thing was that they didn't serve red beans and rice or the shrimp po boy. If someone from Louisiana came into town, they would want to see what kind of product the palace puts out.We did have the crab cakes and had popcorn crawfish which was pretty good.",2 star rating,Albert Q.

I had a smile from the second I walked in to the moment we left. Our new favorite!4/15/17 - We made our way to New Orleans recently and as fantastic as the food was, it was nothing compared to the jambalaya with penne at Palace Grill.

I make sure to enjoy a meal here at least once or twice a year to celebrate the stand out occasions of my family, a.k.a: birthdays, graduations, promotions and such. When you dine here it is more than just a place to catch dinner, it is an experience. This is the only place I know of in the area to enjoy amazing Cajun/Creole food. It's a little slice of Louisiana found right in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.        You are first served with an assortment of steaming fresh muffins and whipped butter. Then the drinks start to roll out, yes they have a full bar. They are famous for their large variety of martinis. Most all their food is seafood based and comes in large portions. Try the Cajun crawfish popcorn as an appetizer; they melt in your mouth. The Palace Sampler platter gives you a bit of everything delicious on the menu and is meant for two! It would be perfect to share on a date. About half way through the night is the best part of the experience at The Palace. The whole staff hands out pamphlets and tells you to open them when the music starts playing. The song ""What a Wonderful World"" starts and everyone opens their booklets to find the lyrics printed out for them so they can sing along. All the waiters come around and cheer with their glasses at every table. To end the night off with a bang, I like to order the chocolate soufflé, which comes out piping hot and baked to perfection.",5 star rating,Natalie R.

NOTE: the earlier you get there at opening the best chance you get to be seated right away.  The lines to get in can get long, particularly on the weekends.The food is excellent Cajun style fare.

Then for dinner I had the Redfish special. Definitely my favorite. Doesn't taste fishy at  all. Then for dessert we had the bread pudding soufflé! I highly recommend this wonderful work of art. The whiskey frosting just tops off what is already a remarkable creation. Overall, a wonderful dinner with an interesting atmosphere and friendly staff.

11/29/2011,"Burbank, CA","To start off, I was a tad skeptical upon arriving as the line to get in (yes, there is a LINE) was mildly intimidating, but The Palace Grill so generously compensates for this with a two man Zydeco group just outside the entrance (not too close, and not so loud that conversation becomes tedious).  The Lady and I waited for perhaps 20-25 minutes to be seated which is normally longer than I would prefer to wait, but this isn't Cheesecake Factory, people!  The Palace Grill is an experience that starts the moment you are in line to be seated and does not end until you are out the doors and around the block.  Even then, you will continue to relive the night for days to come.  Our waiter was a kind and knowledgeable gentleman that attended to our experience with the courteousness of a seasoned garson, but also the joyous enthusiasm one would come to expect of a restaurant emulating the New Orleans spirit.  The intervals between drinks, meal and dessert were well executed and we were made to feel cared for without feeling smothered by over-attentiveness.While the Lady ordered a Coke, I decided to go for something a bit stronger.  The Palace Cajun Martini suited my tastes perfectly with its infusion of Jalapeno peppers.  I do not recall having had a spicier libation, or a better drink served to me in a mason jar!I toned down my sense of adventure for the main course, opting for more traditional Cajun fare: Jambalaya.  I can say without so much as a hint of hyperbole that this is, hands down, the best Jambalaya I have ever had.  Perfectly spicy, even amounts of chicken and shrimp; I cleared my plate with all the restraint I could muster (though I came close at certain points to grabbing the dish with both hands, unhinging my jaw and dumping the meal into my mouth).The Lady decided on a Blackened Ahi Tuna which I was only able to sample momentarily before the fish too was devoured with an equal (albeit more graceful and feminine) enthusiasm.  This fishious was so delicious, with its peppery outer crust and ever so soft inner core, it was a fabulous tangent to my Jambalaya.For dessert, it was unanimous: The Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle.  We had spied this delicacy being feasted upon through the window while standing in line, so there was little dilly-dallying when the time came to decide on our post-entree decadence.  It was interesting to note that the request for dessert must be placed at the time you order your entree.  They explain that the Souffle takes thirty minutes to prepare, but you can't help but wonder if this tactic is employed to better guarantee a dessert order.  As we all know, it's much harder to justify dessert on a full stomach...In short: It rocked.As The Lady and I stumbled away from The Palace Grill into the cool Santa Barbara night, the sounds of Louisiana Zydeco receding behind us, the tastes of the evening remained in our minds, and on our lips.  Should you find yourselves Santa Barbara bound, do make time for this Cajun gem far from the swamps of the bayou, but right at home in the vibrant heart of one of coastal California's most beautiful cities.",5 star rating,J.

3/21/2016,"Palmdale, CA","Went here on a Monday night and was seated right away. The staff was very friendly and attentive and all worked together to accommodate us. The muffins were of interesting flavor and fresh (they will also refill them for you). The food came out quickly and was very well cooked but didn't have that bold Cajun flavor I would have liked.

We ended up coming in late afternoon because they actually close their kitchen at around 10 PM even though this place actually stays open past 11 PM. They have this bread pudding soufflé thing which was just phenomenal since it was not quite soft like a soufflé but still had such delicious flavors with a much thicker texture. It was like eating a yummy bread pudding cake, but softer and creamier!They also have pretty good small dishes, but we were quick so we just hurriedly ate our souffle(s) and drinks and moved onto dinner (yes dessert BEFORE dinner!).The whole place is very quaint feeling despite the fact that its actually quite big and the waiters and hosts are prompt and friendly.

8/31/2013,"Orange, CA","If you have a hankering for Cajun and you can't spot the flight to NO (too far away and too expensive) save your pennies (a lot of them) and come here on your first night in town.  I did a lot of research on restos. and thx. to fellow Yelpers and esp. Doug M, this was one of my top picks!We arrived around 10 pm after driving from the OC, so our wait was only about 20 minutes. We missed the live entertainment but we scored a prime seat at the front and were promptly served with the complimentary little muffins. They were six amazing pieces of goodness. I rec. cutting them in half to share as each was different and delicious.We then started with the much raved about Cajun Crawfish Popcorn with creamy sherry wine sauce. These consisted of Louisiana Crawfish brought to The Palace direct from the warm waters of the Southern Louisiana Bayous. They were dipped in cornmeal buttermilk batter, and flash-fried to a light crispness. Admittedly, I was slightly disappointed. I love fried calamari when I'm craving something fried, and maybe I was expecting the texture to be similar. They were good but a bit too soggy for my liking.Then came the highlight of the meal: the  jambalaya with chicken and and a smoked house recipe of andouille sausage in a deliciously seasoned tomato Creole sauce. Half was perfect for me, but I'm sure if I'd opted for the whole dish I wouldn't have been able to stop eating it. The rice was cooked to perfection and the flavour combo was a definite hit. You must order this dish!We ended with the much raved about bread pudding. Again, it was good but not spectacular. Next time I might opt for the chocolate instead. Still, we left absolutely nothing on our plates, so what does that tell you?*Note*- the couple next to us were celebrating an anniversary, so they were served with the swan profiteroles. Maybe I don't pay attention to a lot of desserts, but I'd never seen anything like it. If hungrier or celebrating, this is the dish for you. So sweet. Drinks-although I ordered wine, if in the mood for spirits, I might order one of their famous mason jar beverages--ask about those. So although I didn't love everything, this place is truly special in so many ways. Make sure you make time for it on your trip. Oh, and come early on w/ends (say, five-ish). They don't accept resos!",5 star rating,B C.

Starting with the Cajun Martini, for example. Just start with it.Try a few different muffins. There's bound to be one you like more than the others, but they are all yummy!Cajun Martini - Joly Jalapeño! Jalapeño infused vodka served in a mason jar over ice with strainer, so you can serve yourself as you imbibe, cherry pepper garnish in the martini glass. Probably about 3 servings of martini.

The first guy saw it and laughed, or possibly he didn't know what we were referring to, either way he just left. The server came later and replaced the but, but not the whole basket, just the butter dish. My wife ordered the jambalaya, and it came without the sausage. Took a little while but they made a side and brought it out.  That's two pretty big strikes but they still charged us full price for the meal. Seems like they could have at least comp'd dessert. Atmosphere is fun and comfortable, servers were knowledgeable and nice, just can't understand how no one thought to cut us a break. Shrimp was excellent, streak was OK.

I ordered the BBQ shrimp on recommendation from the server.  I did like the beer overtones in the saute. The other spices in the saute were a little ordinary.  I explicitly asked for something to knock my socks of with flavor, and I like some fire in my Cajun.  This had neither. The portion size was lean cuisine status. Don't come here if you are a big guy and are starving.  Not what I expected for a $25 dish.I would try the place again, and put in an early order for the bread pudding that everyone raves about.  However will probably also want to try some of the other spots here in SB first.

3/18/2017,"Cupertino, CA","Management needs some serious training!  Went to this Hell-hole for dinner with my husband and our two kids (9 & 13).  Arrived around 8 pm on a Saturday night, and we were seated immediately.  Unfortunately, the two drunk tables seated near us were way over-served with their booze and were screaming bloody murder!  My ears were piercing; it was physically painful.  I asked the host if there were any other tables available, and his response was that one table just got their bill and after they leave, then the yelling would stop.  It doesn't.  And the restaurant keeps serving the screamers at the table behind me more birthday cocktails!!!!!!!!  We couldn't eat our mediocre food fast enough to get out of that frat party excuse of a restaurant.  To have to pay a $126 bill for the luxury of having my hearing assaulted is NOT ok.  We will never return to this poorly-run place again, and neither should you.  Proper management would have never let this happen because they would have CUT OFF these drunks before it got out of hand.  At the very least, they should have put their drunk asses in an Uber so that other people could enjoy their meal.  The food was average, the service was fast and with a smile, but the environment ruined the entire meal.UPDATE: Just got off the phone with management.  Even more angry now.  His excuse, ""We are a celebratory restaurant.""  This is BS.  Being a ""celebratory restaurant"" does not mean that it is ok to allow patrons to abuse their alcohol and act like complete jerks and ruin the meal of those around them!!!  Where is the sense of responsibility?!",1 star rating,Annette A.
1/4/2014,"Fillmore, CA","The Palace Grill was a place a friend of mine chose for a couples night out. The setting is fabulous. It is nestled in Santa Barbara, and I was worried based on it's location and the decor, it made me wonder if this is a 'tourist trap'. Nice environment without any substance.However, my wife and friends were very pleased with their orders. For me, I was a bit of a stick in the mud. So, I would agree that it should of gotten four stars, but I'M WRITING THE REVIEW HERE and I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THEIR STARS for this little trick, the server did.Check this out: I asked the server what is good on the menu. I always ask this question. So basic...what is good. If a server can't tell me what is good, then as a diner, I am in trouble. In this case, the server gave me a hard sell on the Palace Grill's Souffle. I was intrigued. Because a Souffle is a very difficult desert. They must have an accomplished chef to have this server tout it's excellence. I just looked at any item on the menu and what I ordered was something that tasted like a box of warmed Uncle Ben's. I didn't really care about that. I was actually thinking about this great souffle. So finally the moment arrived. I take one look at that Souffle and I knew it was cooked too long, so the peak fell. I was clearly disappointed. The server notices my reaction and then says "" We here, at the Palace Grill like to serve our Souffles in a special way."" With that, he pierces the souffle and then dumps this sweet sauce all inside it. I thought to myself ""Now, I will never really know how dry the Souffle really was.""At this point, my wife and friends have just 'bought the farm' with this guy, and I would look like such a schmuck if I were to complain. I actually appreciate this brilliant move and tipped the guy over 20 percent because of his theatrics!It made my wife love the evening, (the most important part of the dining experience) and for that, The Palace Grill is a favorite, but get me to drive back to Santa Barbara for that, and it will take a very special Souffle to get me there indeed!",3 star rating,Matt R.

We tried the bread pudding souffle, crawfish popcorn, gumbo and the mini muffins. The bread pudding souffle was hot, sweet and differently good. The crawfish popcorn was delicious and addicting!

11/6/2011,"Goleta, CA","We picked The Palace Grill for my birthday celebration, and I was not disappointed! We shared the All the Best sampler platter for two, and we had wayyyyyyyyyy too much food. I'm talking two full meals worth of leftovers!We liked everything on the tray, from the salmon to the soft shelled crabs to the rice stuff that I can't remember the name of....Also the muffin selection was awesome. My favorite one hands-down was the rosemary one. So good. The molasses one was meh, and the rest were decent.The best part of the meal was the GIANT serving that is one drink's worth. Order one martini, and you get an entire mason jar's worth. I was happily tipsy by the time we got through the muffins, and was even more inclined to play along with the Louis Armstrong sing a long and toasting with every waitstaff. Had I not been slightly drunk, this probably would have annoyed me (I can be a bit of a curmudgeon....)My only problem with our experience was that they put us in one half of the restaurant that isn't the main one, and there was only two other tables of people on that side when we got there, but by the end of the meal we were the only ones! What the heck! We didn't get any ambiance or people watching whatsoever, because we were completely alone! Weird!For my birthday they decorated my plate of bread pudding, which was also tasty! We had a great time, and will definitely come back!",4 star rating,Rae C.

9/23/2013,"Frisco, TX","We came here last week while spending the day in Santa Barbara during our vacation.  I'm originally from Opelousas, Louisiana and I know Creole/Cajun cooking.  The food was okay, but it was not Creole/Cajun cooking.  The owner is very nice, but some of the recipes need to be tweaked.  The gumbo in particular is tomato based and thick in consistency.  Where I'm from, the gumbo is not tomato based nor is it thick.  We had some red beans and rice as an appetizer.  Again, not cooked quite like central Louisiana.  Decent flavor, but comes up short on the presentation.Nice spot and friendly owner and waiters.",2 star rating,Filicia J.

Service was outstanding,  and the atmosphere is kind of fun. We were hoping the servers would be doing magic tricks, but apparently we were there on the wrong night for that. What we did get was a short sing along. It's a local place downtown with its own unique character. I don't regret going here, but probably will look for other places to try next time I'm in town.",3 star rating,Kelly A.
7/18/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","My overall impression of this place is that this is the less spicy and dumb down version of authentic Cajun food.  We started the meal with a cup of seafood gumbo.  The broth was watery and the seafood was sparse.  It was not terrible, but not good enough for a place that specializes in Cajun cuisine.  Next came our entrees, blackened salmon and crawfish pasta.  I ordered my salmon medium, but it came out well done.  This is why I feel reluctant to order fish at none Asian restaurants.  Fish only taste moist and flavorful when they are slightly underdone, and most places never cook the fish to the temperature that I asked.  There was a container of seasoned drawn butter served with the fish, but the advertised jalapeno beurre blanc was missing from the plate.  I agree with some reviewers that the most prominent flavor here is butter.  I love butter, who doesn't like real butter, but I also expected a heavy dose of seasoning that was notably missing here .  The creole pasta sauce was flavorful, but the crawfish, like the salmon was overcooked.  We ended our lunch with the famous bread pudding, a very soft and warm spiced cake topped with a cream sauce spiked with whiskey.  It was good, but way overhyped by fellow patrons.  Service was lackluster and very slow.  There was no designated server here.  It seemed like there were 3 servers and one of the three was doing more than her fair share of the work.",2 star rating,Lily Z.
9/6/2011,"Las Vegas, NV","We came here after wine tasting and I was so dehydrated.  They gave us glasses of water that I sucked down immediately.  After which they switched to giant trough sized water glasses for me, now that's more like it.  The food was supposed to be Cajun.  I thought it was okay.  I had a gumbo yaya that came in a tiny bowl and didn't taste that great.  The chicken that my friend ordered looked dry.  But it was a breast and he scarfed down the whole thing so must have been good!!We had the bread pudding souffle that everyone's been raving about.  Eh....  It was okay.  For all the hype...  Whatever.  The walls were covered with cool paintings and art and everything felt magical, even if they weren't really.  And there was a magician there, performing tricks for various tables.  The atmosphere is definitely cool but the food, I must say, is just mediocre, and not cheap, like $16 to $25 per entree.",3 star rating,Lin G.

10/29/2015,"Tustin, CA",I went here for thr first time for my graduation dinner with the girls and it was a GREAT EXPERIENCE. I tried the jambalaya pasta which was amazing and flavorful. I also tried a bit of my friends' dishes like the crawfish pasta lafitte which was creamy and delicious as well. The coconut shrimps are a must and so is the crawfish popcorn. I absolutely love cajun style food because it uses a bunch of spices and flavors which blow my tastebuds. The atmosphere is lively and active and the whole staff passes out a song sheet to sing at a certain time. Its really cute and I like how it makes the crowd active. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely come again.,5 star rating,Jane K.
6/20/2016,"Irvine, CA","I have been to The Palace Grill twice now and the food is always exceptional. Tonight I had the cajun crawfish popcorn shrimp appetizer which tasted amazing. It was crunchy and well spiced. It comes with a creamy sherry wine sauce that I really enjoyed. I don't usually like sauces, but this one added to the flavor of the crawfish. For dinner, I had the Crawfish ÉTOUFFÉE. This portion was huge and could have easily feed two people. It was well seasoned and cooked. The crawfish was soft and just melted in my mouth. The rice on the bottom was full of onions and peppers increasing that cajun feel and flavor. We finished off the meal with the chocolate souffle. You have to give the waiter 30 mins notice if you are ordering this dessert because it takes time to cook. It was a warm gooey cake baked in a ramekin that they opened and poured a chocolate bourbon cream sauce inside and finished off the plate with the words palace written in chocolate. This dessert tasted like heaven. It was warm and gooey and the sauce was not overly flavored that it distracted from the taste of the cake. I would highly recommend this restaurant if your ever in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Christina D.
11/20/2011,"Washington, DC","A great meal to start off my first trip to Santa Barbara! After much deliberation between the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn and the Caribbean Coconut Shrimp, we went with the shrimp and man am I glad we did! Huge shrimp, dipped in coconut and batter, perfectly crispy but without overcooking the shrimp and came with this dipping sauce that was sweet and tangy. Oh man, I died for that shrimp. So good. Definitely a must-get!Then came the entree: Creole Crawfish Crabcakes. My friend and I split it and they split it for us onto two plates. Love it when places do that! But anyway, back to the crabcakes. We got it without the jalapeno buerre-blanc sauce and I'm glad we did. The crabcakes were already so good and flavorful on their own that I think the sauce would've just detracted from it. And of course, we got dessert. After vacillating between the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle and the Dark Chocolate Souffle, we decided to go with the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle. It's their thing and how could we NOT get it? It was melt-in-your-mouth-makes-a-chocoholic-forget-that-this-dessert-isn't-chocolate good. It wasn't too sweet and man, just what the doctor ordered.The bread basket is also a nice perk -- different flavored muffins made it tons of fun to try them all out. So a couple of complaints: not-so-great service (we didn't get our muffins til halfway through our meal!!) and there was a spider on the wall. That we had to kill ourselves. But hey, the food was so good that I still gave the restaurant 4 stars.",4 star rating,Iris T.
6/21/2011,"Long Beach, CA","I heard some good things about this place before coming, so I was excited to try it (+ it was going to be paid for! :D)They only take reservations for 5:30, but after that, you just wait in line. We got there around 7pm on a Saturday, and there was a good-sized line, but it moved pretty quickly. They had a band outside that entertains you while you wait, and they sometimes even pass out instruments for you to play along with! The music took me right to the New Orleans Square in Disneyland (closest thing I've been to the real place). :)After we were seated, we were served some warm cornbread muffins with all sorts of different flavors (yelp.com/biz_photos/edJo…). Good, but not mind-blowing. I tried some of the cajun martini, which was really interesting. It's marinated with jalepenos, which makes it spicy! It definitely had a kick, but I wouldn't be able to finish the jar they give you on my own (yelp.com/biz_photos/edJo…). We then ordered our food, and I had a hard time deciding between the jambalaya  and the paneed veal acadiana, but ended up going with the latter since everyone else seemed to be ordering jambalaya. It was basically fettuccine topped with veal medallions and crawfish. (yelp.com/biz_photos/edJo…) The crawfish was really good! The veal was decent, but not that flavorful or tender. The alfredo sauce was really creamy but a little bland as well. The oyster sherry cream sauce was good though. I'd give it a 3.5. The jambalaya was pretty good, both the dirty rice and the penne version (yelp.com/biz_photos/edJo…). And word of advice to the guys, you might want to order ""huge"" because the boys in our group ordered ""large,"" which is actually a pretty standard size and they were still a little hungry.The 2 things that really stood out though was the dessert and the atmosphere. For dessert, try the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle. (yelp.com/biz_photos/edJo…) It was sooo good! We tried both the chocolate souffle and the bread pudding one, but I liked the bread pudding one a lot better. It came out hot with a cool Grand Marnier whiskey cream sauce that you pour over it, and it was the perfect blend of hot and cold and sweet! As for the atmosphere, it was great! The servers were really friendly and the crowd was lively, which makes it kind of loud in there, but it's fun! And during the middle of your dinner, they bring out these song books and when the music starts, everyone sings along and all the servers come out to clink glasses!",4 star rating,Catherine C.

Yes I'm telling you to come to eat their muffins which include banana nut, buttermilk jalepeno, molasses, lemon, rosemary, and apricot. This itself should tell you that you're in for a treat.I came here on a Saturday night expecting a LONG wait. Little did I know that they don't even take names, not even reservations (unless it's for a 5:30PM seating on Saturday). They didn't want my name I say? Yes they don't! Just stand in line and I swear you'll only wait for like ten minutes despite this place being packed at 8pm. In we walked into a Louisiana-southern decorated places with poker cards on the wall and ceiling, listening to the hustle and bustle of conversations. We sat at our table and didn't know what to get. Wait, I take that back. Of course I wanted that Jambalya that people speak of and that Bread Pudding Souffle. Our table of 3 opted for the Palace Sampler (which is for two.. but trust me, 3 can finish this and be full at the end). The platter consisted of the..-The Chicken Tchoupitoulas: mmm creamy and good-The Caribbean coconut Shrimp: it's alright but you definitely taste the coconut-The Jambalaya: OMG please, please give me more because I'm LOVING it!-Blackened New York Steak w/ Cajun Hollandaise: one word: HALLELUJAH!-and the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle with Whiskey Cream Sauce: OMG I'm singing praises with the angels at this point despite my stomach being SO DAMN FULL!Service was wonderful and helpful! Did I mention the Palace Sampler Platter doesn't come with Jambalaya and that they went ahead and replaced the Blackened Catfish with it instead because I REALLY wanted the Jambalya AND didn't charge me extra for it?! And I swear we saw 4-5 different servers being that you never have the same person helping you. And to top it off, the WHOLE RESTAURANT got to sing a song together ( I wont' tell you what song to not spoil the surprise), and the servers came around to do cheers with their drinks?! OMG..

1/4/2012,"Ontario, CA","Don't let the large crowd of people outside the restaurant scare you off! The line moves quickly and there is free entertainment to keep you occupied. The food here is good, but the atmosphere is really what makes it stand out.My boyfriend and I came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm and the place was packed. The reviews were so good that we decided to wait it out. We stood by the free entertainment outside--an accordion player who tries to get the crowd to sing along. Everyone in line was so happy and friendly that we didn't mind waiting. It took about 30 minutes to get a table (I was told it would take about minutes). This restaurant has won many awards of the years for their great service and it shows.To start off we ordered crawfish popcorn and a mango iced tea. We also ordered the jambalaya pasta, which is their most popular pasta dish, as well as their crawfish etouffe. For dessert, we had the bread pudding souffle. The crawfish popcorn was great! The breading is not too heavy or crispy. The free biscuits they provided were also good, especially when paired with the spicy dishes. The pasta was really good and the ""half order"" was huge! I would have liked the etouffe more if it wasn't so spicy, but I understand that this is a Cajun restaurant. The souffle wasn't that impressive. It tasted like a cinnamon roll. Next time, I would try the chocolate souffle instead.To sum up, this restaurant has good food, great service and a one-of-a-kind ambiance. During our meal, the waitresses passed around the words to ""What A Wonderful World"" and everyone sang along and toasted. I left in a great mood and will definitely be back when I'm in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Kim B.

8/17/2009,"Concord, CA","Before visiting Santa Barbara this past weekend, the last time I ate at The Palace was in 2002 when I was attending UCSB and my father took me to dinner while he was in town on business.  I was a little worried that my positive memory of The Palace was a bit jaded by being a starving college student.  At my dad's request, we had dinner here this past Friday night.  I had called to make a reservation but they only take reservations for 5:30 on Fridays.  We decided to have an early dinner, worried that we would have a really long wait without a reservation.  As it turns out, they really didn't start getting busy until around 7 so we probably could have dropped in around 6 or 6:30 no problem.  I started with the Cajun martini.  It comes in a pint or quart.  I went with the pint and that was plenty.  It was spicy but not overwhelming. Definitely worth the $10.We were served a selection of muffins - rosemary, molasses, jalapeño, apricot...and one I can't remember.  My favorite was the rosemary although I didn't try the jalapeno because my honey and father beat me to them.  My mom said that the apricot and molasses ones both tasted like dessert. I ordered the crawfish crabcakes (entree).  They were amazing.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them.  Crispy outside, tender inside, not greasy at all, beautifully seasoned and topped with a delicious jalapeño sauce.  They were served with fresh veggies (artichoke, zucinni, yellow squash, carrots) and rice.  I honestly didn't even get to the rice because the veggies and crabcakes were plenty for me but I appreciate the gesture.  We spoke with the manager (?) who was very welcoming and personable.  Our waitress was also very nice and we never had to ask for anything.  She had it covered!  I am now sure that my positive memory wasn't the least bit jaded.  The Palace serves up delicious food and beverages in a very fun and festive atmosphere.",5 star rating,Emily J.

And I NEVER send food back. I am a human garbage disposal. I can eat/inhale anything and everything. For me to send a dish back, especially if it's fried chicken bites, it's gotta be BAD.I hate to bring their rating down since it seems like others think so highly of it... I'm just so turned off that a restaurant can't even do fried chicken tenders right?

When i asked the waitress whether i should get the crawfish crabcakes or the jambalaya, she suggested that i get the crawfish crabcakes with the jambalaya rice instead of the white rice that it normally comes with. that was the best thing ever. i got everything i wanted on one plate with enough to take home. i forgot to mention that they gave me 5 corn-muffins with different ingredients...like rosemary, bran, banana walnut, raisin, etc i forget, but they were very good. it was the best meal i had in SB of 2005i've always had a rule about preserving good memories because the chances of revisiting a place or time in the past being better this time than last time is pretty slim.  Refer to How I Met Your Mother's ""The Best Burger in New York"" episode.  I think the same goes for high school and college reunions.  i had such a great time back then, i can only be disappointed if i go back.see pics of food (this time around)",4 star rating,Winnie L.

5/3/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Came here with the family. As a starter we got their ""famous"" Cajun crawfish popcorn. For my taste it was far too breaded and not so heavy in the flavor. The dipping sauce that came with it was ok, but nothing special. For the main course I got the pan BBQ'd Shrimp. There weren't many of them, and they were swimming in some sort of pepper-butter sauce. It wasn't bad, but I felt it was too salty. It also came with some rice and vegetables (?). Not bad, but not great either. For dessert we tried the souffle, which was very good. The service was pretty good. They don't have assigned waiters, so everyone sort of comes around and helps you out. This means that it's not hard to find someone to help you, but also the possibility of falling between the cracks. They also sing a song while you're there, which adds to the whole experience. It would be better if it were a bit cheaper, but for the price and the food, It doesn't deserve more than 3.5 stars.",3 star rating,Denis S.
7/14/2013,"Berkeley, CA","Came to Palace Grill for lunch on a weekend trip down to SB.  There was no wait and the service was pretty good, definitely better than the longgg line we saw the last night.First off get the Cajun Martini.  It packs a punch though so be ready - definitely got me a little day-drunk.  Also be prepared because it's a little on the hot side, or at least hotter than you'd expect for a martini.  That being said it was delicious, and I don't even like martinis, I got it because of a friend's recommendation.  Which brings me to the crabcakes.  Again, not really a fan of crabcakes but the so got em and wow they were bomb.  Definitely recommend them.Popcorn crawfish are a must get!  I had the blackened catfish.  It was ok, I would have preferred more of a solid/catifsh taste like grandma used to make =)The muffins were great, both entrees came with them but we definitely underestimated how tasty they would be.",4 star rating,Beth U.

10/16/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","Drove up to SB for the day to catch The Killers concert @ the bowl. The brother and I decided to check out The Palace Grill after taking some advice from my peeps on Yelp. Ambiance: We walk in to some sweet Bob Marley tracks playing on the speakers. The Food: First, they bring a little basket of freshly baked muffins of say 6 different flavors. Totally different than your typical bread basket. The molasses muffin and some other w/apricot were terrific! Crab cakes were a little pricey. Expect to pay about $16 for 2 crab cakes and a handful of veggies on the side. Totally worth it if you're looking for quality and FLAVOR. The crab cakes were terrific (best I've had) and the veggies were perfectly seasoned. Follow that with some bread pudding.. yum! The bread pudding came along with a side of whiskey sauce which was a great punctuation mark to a terrific meal.The Service: Staff was super friendly. We let the waitress know we were in a bit of a rush because we had a concert to catch and she was INCREDIBLY accommodating and super friendly. A++ for service, hands down. NOTES: Didn't really dig the lemonade because it's carbonated but maybe you like it like that.. Great restaurant location.. right in the middle of downtown SB. Super pedestrian friendly town! Tons of  ""First 70 minutes Free"" parking lots. Incredibly easy to get around! Gotta come back for lunch and try those po' boy sandwiches for under $10.. taking a drive up to SB on Saturday just for this purpose.",5 star rating,Marcela H.
1/7/2011,"Huntington Beach, CA","The Service here is impeccable and amazing, and quite possibly one of the best restaurant for their service. Everyone is friendly, smiling and they sing and go around talking to each table and they cheer and drink! I always feel so welcomed and everyone I've brought here has said the same. It's a popular joint amongst the locals so try to make a reservation, but the wait is not that bad for walk-ins: we usually wait 20-30 minutes without a reservation. Very fun restaurant with New Orleans decor and beads and colorful lights.

I can only afford to go on special occasions, but happily return because the food is worth the price. I used to love the veal with seafood, but after becoming pescetarian have highly favorited their fish dishes, which are plentiful, fresh, and full of flavor.

You MUST try the Creole Crawfish Crabcakes and the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn. Louisiana Bread Pudding Soufflé and Dark Chocolate Soufflé. you have not lived a full life, until you have tried these two desserts. Absolutely incredible.

4/21/2009,"San Diego, CA","My boyfriend and I were in Santa Barbara for my birthday a few weeks ago.  When my friend Katie recommended this place from her college days, I totally had to check it out.  Cajun food.... and SINGING?!  I'm THERE, baby!From other Yelpers' reviews, I was anticipating a super long wait of an hour or more; however, when we arrived, we waited about 10-15 minutes max.  Very pleased with them thus far. We carefully reviewed the menu and EVERYTHING looked delicious.  We decided to go with the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn for appetizers.  Now I'm not a huge fan of crawfish, but man, those babies were pretty tasty.  The sauce was reminiscent of the remoulade dipping sauce at Bubba Gump (the one that comes with the hushpups).  While feasting on our crawfishies, we were presented with a cornbread basket filled with five different flavors: rosemary, jalapeno cheese, maple, apricot, and.... something dark and a little bitter.For our entrees, my boyfriend went with the Jambalaya pasta while I ordered the Penne Pasta Pontalba.  The jambalaya was so.... darn... good.  I kept picking off of his plate, but don't get me wrong: the penne was great as well!  I personally love jambalaya AND creole sauces, so together, these two dishes were the perfect selections.  A lot of cajun pastas that have shrimp tend to have a fishy smell the next day, but the jambalaya was just as delicious as leftovers as they were when it first arrived at the table -- a testament of how fresh the food was!  I will definitely say that the one thing I miss most about SB is The Palace Grill.  I'm sad just thinking about it.We didn't order any dessert since we were so stuffed.  The amount of food in an entree was very generous.  We had well over half of our plates left over when we finished eating, but maybe since we stuffed our faces with cornbread and popcorn crawfish, that might explain it.  None of the desserts looked appetizing enough to ""force"" down, to be truthful.  I know, I know, how could I hate on souffles?  I DO.  They're GROSS.  Bananas Foster was tempting, though.Totally loved this place.  They also did a sing-song, which was really neat.  We arrived right when it was about to start; what a shame it was that we didn't have any water or wine to toast with!  ""What a Wonderful World"" was the song of the night (but it's also the same song every time, I've heard).  Such a unique place it was!  Can't wait to eat there again someday.",5 star rating,Angeline D.
2/5/2010,"Vallejo, CA","Good times.Decent cajun food. We had the ""All the Best"" platter. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the blackened salmon and spicy crawfish étouffée. The soft shell crab and coconut shrimp were pretty standard. There was a dipping sauce with a name that escapes me, but it tasted great.The staff was friendly. They gave us some spicy powder just in case the food wasn't spicy enough. And the place has a great vibe. I've never sang ""What A Wonderful World"" out loud in a restaurant before. That goes in the ""memory books"" for me. And the one-person bathrooms have funny little drawings of naked people chasing each other on each of the walls.Yes, it is pricey, but you can't put a price on good times.",4 star rating,LM M.

4/8/2009,"Santa Clara, CA","All KINDS of ridiculousness here!!  You know it's a good restaurant when, even after a nice weekend in Santa Barbara w/beautiful weather, you're still talking about the meal 3 days later.You'll need to line up early though to get in when they open the doors at 530p for dinner (as of this post).  After that, the line get's pretty long.The excellent service was only surpassed by the excellent food.  The gf and I were first time visitors, so we had to go for the sampler dinner for 2, I think it was called the ""All the Best"" platter.I'd never had soft shell crab before, but I'm glad that the first time I tried it was here.  Ridiculously good.The crawfish was awesome, and the gf and I couldn't stop talking about the blackened salmon.  It was just perfect and really hit the spot after a long day of walking around town.  Even the vegetables were awesome, soaking the juicy seasoned goodness of the salmon and crawfish.  Mmm.... juicy goodness...The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely make it a point to come here for either lunch or dinner.  Definitely worth it.A note about the reservation system: You can only call-in to get a table at 5:30p when they open the doors.  This allows you to line up in the ""Reservations"" line and gets you in the door first.  After that, however, e.g. making dinner reservations at 7:00p, I guess you'll have to wait in line with everyone else.  So if you don't want to wait, plan for an early dinner.  Worth it.  Trust me.",5 star rating,A.v.

My dad actually hid a Jewelry box one year inside the soufflé  for my mom and she was so surprised! The staff is really sweet and attentive. Lunch the Crawfish Popcorn Po'Boy is def. a must have! For dinner start with Cajun Crawfish Popcorn as a starter and for the main meal I usually get the Capellini La Louisianne...mmmm so good!

1/17/2011,"Alhambra, CA","As all the other yelpers have said, this place has service that shines. Waiters singing and toasting everyone--all the waitstaff truly seemed to enjoy themselves and welcome customers, but for me the food was just so-so. The food was missing something, some kind of zing of flavor.My friend and I shared the palace sampler platter for 2. Our favorite items were the coconut shrimp--3 large pieces with a nice crunch and the bread pudding souffle--not too sweet, hot and fresh, easy to cool down with the milky whiskey sauce. The blackened catfish was also good.The chicken tchoupitoulas and blackened NY steak were cooked just right, but I felt like the creamy sauces didn't really add much flavor. The rice was definitely the worst thing on the plate. Some pieces mushy, some pieces separated, and all bland. You gotta take the sauce off the meat and put it on the rice, but they don't give you a spoon :-/Overall my friend and I had a nice time, but I probably won't go back.",4 star rating,Francesca L.

8/19/2006,"San Mateo, CA","Volkswagon contacted me in late August a couple years ago offering me a chance to drive their forthcoming flagship, the Phaeton. I was surprised, to say the least, because it looked like it was a no-strings offer to drive a car that will have a sticker price well over $60,000. That's exactly what I got - a chance to drive an awesome car for a day! In addition to driving around San Francisco, we drove to Santa Barbara for lunch at The Palace Grill. Not many other places would be worth 10 hours of driving, but the Palace is one such place! The car made it easy, too. We picked up the car with about 80 miles on it and returned it with over 900. The 335hp engine, the incredibly comfortable seats, and all of the gadgets made it a lot of fun.The word in Santa Barabara was that the Palace has the best cajun food West of the Mississippi. I haven't tried them all, but this is some damn good food. Their Po' Boys are delicious, and be sure to try the crawfish popcorn. Friends at my table had steaks, which were excellent (and I'm, uh, vegetarian...). For dessert you should try the beignets, or the double chocolate souffle.phil.photosite.com/Phaet…One of the best parts was the Ball mason jar of martini with marinated chilis.

This is a huge plate, for two but could easily feed three if you also shared an appetizer. Too much food on plate is a nice problem, esp since it was all delicious and cooked just right. The steak was medium rare and tasty. The catfish blackened and an eye opener for me. That was my favorite, I'd never had it before. Coconut shrimp a bit sweet for my taste.

On all occasions it was very hard to hold a conversation, and some of those times it wasn't that crowded. It's neat that the staff wear nice jackets and are wonderfully polite. Is this new? The first time I went, our waitress was more of a party girl who kept draping beads on me and my co-workers. Awkward.I had the crab cakes, which were okay. Accompanying veggies were nicely crisp-tender. An order of beignets went sadly uneaten since we were trying to talk and it's dangerous to talk with all that powdered sugar flying around.The lunch menu is perfectly satisfying.

We only spent one night in SB this year and you better believe we ate at The Palace!! Atmosphere is awesome. Our waiter that was fantastic the year before immediately greeted us and welcomed us back. Wow, awesome! Brought us some great drinks just in time to sing It's A Wonderful Life with the whole restaurant.We loved the crawfish poppers..so good! Ate every one on the plate...spotless.Ordered the sampler platter for two...why? Because there are so many great items on the menu and we couldn't just settle on one or two. The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly and flaked apart easily. The chicken is smothered with an amazing sauce and served over a bed of rice and is delicious. The coconut shrimp are the best we have ever had.  Butterflied with a light crispy crust and sweet dipping sauce, they are packed full of flavor. Finally, the filet we ordered rare. It was prepared perfectly! Honestly the best filet I have had in a really long time. Seasoned just right with the hollandaise sauce on the side, this steak was to die for. We went back and forth trying to pick a favorite from the platter but neither of us could decide on just one. Even the vegetables with dill seasoning were out of this world. An amazing plate full of phenomenal food.Lastly, our bread pudding soufflé was incredible! The whiskey sauce is amazing and ""Welcome Back"" written in Ghiridelli chocolate on the plate was a nice touch too. 5 stars all the way for my favorite restaurant of all time now!! Love this place!!

11/3/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","I was in Santa Barbara for a conference and was told that The Palace Grill was the place to be. I wanted to be the judge of that.I came with a lady friend and we ordered the following:- Cajun crawfish popcorn- Chicken Tchoupitoulas- Stuffed Blackened Filet Mignon - Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle - Palace Cajun Martini Pros:- Awesome meal.  From start to finish.- Cajun crawfish popcorn - Very good starter. Delicately crispy.  The dipping sauce is a winner.- Chicken Tchoupitoulas - Recommended by the waitress. Flavorful garlic sauce covered the chicken.  Good, but I don't know if I'd order this again.- Stuffed Blackened Filet Mignon - Absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and tasty.  The side of homemade Worcestershire Sauce enhanced the flavor of the filet tenfold. My favorite part of the steak was that it was stuffed with crawfish tails and creole spices. Worked great in combination with the filet. It's a winner!- Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle - I've never tasted anything like it. Warm and sweet pudding served in the core of bread.  The sweetness of the pudding compliment its bread exterior. I'd definitely order this, even if you're full.- Palace Cajun Martini - I'm actually not a fan of martinis but this one was good.  Packed a lot of alcohol but was not unbearable.- You're forced to sing a song. They provide a song sheet and there's lots of drinking involved. Very fun environment.Cons:- None.Food's delicious. Atmosphere's extremely fun.

My favorite is the molasses.The house salad was great, the boyfriend who hates greens actually cleaned plate. The catfish was delicate and bursting with flavor. Then came dessert. Their signature Bread Pudding Souffle was crazy taste bud exploding deliciousness! I usually skip this type of this dish but for The Palace Grill I'll always make the exception.

The swan dessert (my friend insisted on a birthday celebration) was definitely left from yesterday. Pastry was dense, tough and cold.

12/2/2009,"San Francisco, CA","I'm not typically inclined towards Cajun food, since I'm averse to spicy foods (i.e. it makes me gag and choke and all that other nasty stuff), but this place was really great! Came here from a few friends' recommendations and thought what the hell... and I was very pleased! I heard the drinks were pretty strong so I ordered a couple Rieslings to get my appetite going (which totally did the trick). Really loved the assorted mini muffins they deliver to your table right away, which I had to be careful not to fill up on before our food arrived cuz they were so yummy! My fav was the molasses and banana nut one, but they also had buttermlik and jalapeno. We skipped out on the appetizers (which was a shame b/c the table next to us ordered some fine looking popcorn shrimp which I envied from afar) and waited not too long for our main courses - jumbalaya and the blackened redfish for me. This was a dinner special and seemed to be a commodity, so my expectations were raised... and I have to say it didn't disappoint! They even arranged it into a fish shape, complete with buttered veggies and roasted potatoes which I gobbled up (b/c at this point I was well buzzed). I even ordered another round of muffins which came quickly to our table. For dessert I ordered the dark chocolate souffle (b/c according to our waitress, I HAD TO) and my bf got The Palace Swan which was a delicious light(er) counterpart to my rich souffle. We joined forces and could only finish 3/4th of the combined desserts after our big meals. All in all it was a good experience that hit the spot, given that I wasn't expecting to fall in love with a Cajun restaurant, but I can see how it's become so popular and well liked by everyone. I'd come back for more of the seafood (and muffins) for sure!",4 star rating,Natalie W.

9/18/2016,"Rio Vista, CA","We went on a busy Saturday night after not getting a table at another local restaurant.  The Maitre'd was amazing and said it would be a few minutes.  While we waited outside, there was a musical trio that were tons of fun.  We were quickly seated and had the best waitress, Jessica.  Actually all of the waitstaff were amazing.  The food was to die for and then we even got to sing. My family kept saying they just loved the restaurant.  We topped it off with their amazing bread pudding soufflé and a chocolate soufflé.  We love the Bananas Foster too but it was so hard to choose.  We will definitely be back soon!! We actually met a gentleman that drives an hour just to eat there.  What a testament to how spot on they are!!  Excellent service and atmosphere!!",5 star rating,Stefanie D.
3/10/2016,"Vancouver, WA","I came here on my one year anniversary.. we had such a blast. The ambiance is fun and romantic.. the staff has a point in the evening where they leave lyrics on your table and the whole restaurant will start singing like a Frank Sinatra of Natalie Cole song together with the patrons. It's really a cool experience, and the food is really good. So flavorful and the portions can easily be shared. It's right on state street so after dinner you can take a stroll up and down the trip and walk off those amazing calories you just ate! Get dessert too. Oh and they bring out these amazing muffins instead of bread and they are SO GOOD. Flavors like molasses and banana nut... I forget the others but they are so good. Freshly baked too!",5 star rating,Dalia G.

7/19/2013,"Santa Monica, CA",Chef Paul Prudhomme originally designed their first menu. Great Cajun food in Southern California. Their fresh pickled hot peppers that they serve in their martinis are an awesome added touch.Friendly staff. Upscale atmosphere but the staff comes way out of their way to make everyone feel at home. You can close your eyes and point at the menu and know that you'll have one of the best meals of your life. I have honestly drove from Santa Monica (Los Angeles) to Santa Barbara just to eat at The Palace. It's just that good. You'll have dreams about the food.,5 star rating,Food L.

The place couldn't be more charming and fun. The staff is top notch, tons of help with the menu if you need it, don't hesitate to ask. We had the crawfish popcorn and they were heavenly. I had the diver scallops and just about licked my plate. My friend had the filet and MIL had the crab cakes - she said they were the best she's ever had.

11/28/2013,"Bakersfield, CA",Used to eat here all the time when we lived in SB.  Start with the crawfish popcorn. It is so delicious dipped in their spicy sauce. I've tried almost everything so you can't go wrong with any order. The red fish is a mild fish that you should try if they aren't out of it. You will always get great service because the staff works as a team so anyone can help you. The palace martini is my favorite. Jalapeño infused vodka with cherry peppers is amazing! If you don't like spicy food this drink isn't for you. Save room and order the bread pudding soufflé. Freshly baked hot out of the oven it has a decadent sauce poured over that melts in your mouth.,5 star rating,Monique W.

Almost every worker came by our table and helped us out weather it was to give us water or handing us our food. This place is definitely one of a kind. I love it when they have that special time in the day when everyone sings together to a classic jazz song. When I was there we sang ""wonderful world"" by Louis Armstrong. Their food is good too. This place is prolly the first place I've really started liking cajun. Their pasta are all good. And their little muffins they serve as appetizers are  soooo good! I can get full off them alone. Overall good experience.",4 star rating,Leslie V.
9/24/2011,"Beaverton, OR","Let me just say I rarely give out 5 stars nowadays and I had pretty high expectations for this place because it was highly recommended to me by a friend and after trying it tonight, I think it definitely reached and exceeded my high expectations! Food: 1) complimentary muffins: I LOVE FREE STUFF!! There were so many different flavors that came in that basket that I don't even remember what they said but they were all awesome and super yummy! Most notable was the Jalapeno cheddar muffin! YUMMY!2) Crabcake appetizer with pilaf rice: YES, ONE crab cake, but it was damn good! Had large chunks of delicious crab in it, well seasoned and pan fried to perfection. I don't even like rice and this rice was fantastic!3) Jambalaya: the shrimp was fresh, the rice was well flavored, it had just enough sauce but not too soupy but the only down fall was the chicken! The chicken was just toooo dry! Otherwise, with a little bit more spicy flavor and better chicken, this dish would have been AMAZING! It had so much potential! 4) Scallops with pilaf rice and veggies: Rice was, once again, amazing! Buttered veggies were yummy. The scallops were phenomenal!! Cooked cnce and crispy on the outside while the inside locked in all the wonderful juicy scallop flavor. Wish it came with more than 4 pieces!5) Bread Pudding Souffle: A bit overboard on the sweet side but that's expected with desserts. Very soft and pudding-like on the inside with a harder, crustier outside. Came with a very rich creamy white sauce and Ghiraradelli chocolate. Supposedly, there were suppose to be RAISINS in the bread pudding, but I made the extra effort to eat the ENTIRE dessert to find that there was only ONE raisin in the entire thing. So that was a bit miss leading...Service: PHENOMENAL!!! I don't really recall dining at too many places that had exceptional service but this place is definitely going to be added to the short list!! As soon as we were seated the waiter came over to greet us and break down the menu for us (which I ALWAYS love because it really helps get the ordering process going and orient you), our water was never empty, we never had to wait too long for our next course and I've just never felt more welcomed! Amazing job!Ambiance: I LOVE the ambiance here! During the course of the night, they passed out lyrics to ""What a Wonderful World"" song and they played it super loud and everyone sung along. During this collaborative singing experience, the waiters all walked around with their own glasses of wine to toast all of us. It was a really fun experience! Price: A bit on the pricy side but worth every penny! Overall: I would LOVE to come back to try other cajun dishes on their menu!! I'm so impressed with this place! Well done!",5 star rating,Amiee H.
8/20/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Been here several times and its always so delicious and the staff is very attentive and friendly!

6/1/2010,"Los Angeles, CA",I give this a 4-star review because the food was off the hoook! the 1.5 hour wait on the other hand was ridiculous! We got there at 7:30pm and stood in line for a little over 1.5 hrs. me and my friend grabbed a hot dog on state and our g/fs waited.  We got back after getting hotdogs and still had to wait a while but man oh man the food was sooo good.I ordered the veal with the crwafish the other people in the party ordered the etoufiette  and jambalaya. All very good. A little pricey in my opinion but with good quality you can't complain. the portions were surprisingly not large. But that's not a bad thing. The sauces were rich with flavor a little thick with flour in my opinion. Drank a ton of water lol. But the little muffins they serve were off the hook!Jalapeno and chese muffin and banana nut and rosemary etc.. it was like 5 diff flavors and very tiny. So it made it perfect to sample all of them. I really enjoyed this place we had a great time. It was a bit late but none the less good. Dessert was bread pudding and the chocolate souffle. Again done right. We even sang songs in the end with everybody cheering in the late night.Overall Price was ok wait was a bit horrible and food was fantastic.,4 star rating,steven l.

""YES, PLEASE!""Now, I've been to New Orleans a couple of times, and this place ain't NOLA, but it's one of the better cajun-style places I've been outside of Louisiana. I got the scallops, which were great, and we got the much-lauded bread pudding souffle w. whisky sauce. It came on a plate w. ""Welcome to the Palace Grill"" in melted chocolate. The service is super-friendly (:almost: too friendly, but not quite), and they passed out lyric sheets for a restaurant-wide sing-a-long. Now I am a cold, cynical person whose heart shriveled years ago, but again, for some reason, it worked. The waitstaff toast each table, and their eyes weren't cold and dead. So they're either just the nicest group of folks this side of the Mississippi, or they're doing a lot of good drugs. Either way, it sort of works. A fun night in good company and decent food.",4 star rating,Jen D.

9/22/2011,"Ventura, CA","Definitely worth the 1.25 hour wait!! Especially since the band outside provides not only great entertainment but gets the waiting guests involved- from singing to playing instruments - my fav. being the spoon and washboard! It is also a grand treat when the waitresses come outside to serve the hungry waiting mob appetizers.It starts off with them bringing a basket of different flavored muffins from apricot to molasses to jalapeno. My favorite dish is the crayfish pasta. The sauce is spicy and VERY flavorful. For dessert you have to try both the chocolate souffle and the bread pudding with bourbon sauce. Their lemon drops are FUN, as they are served in a mason jar-like mug and you ""strain"" them yourself. The rims are coated in powder sugar.If you are there late enough singing will take place with rounds of CHEERS from the staff.",5 star rating,Diana G.

The jambalaya got our nod, but the étouffée was not a distant second. Finished with the Louisiana bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Amazing!

We got the Bread Pudding Souffle and the dark chocolate souffle. Both are pretty delicious, though don't judge the bread pudding by normal bread pudding standards. It has a lot of the components and some of the flavors of bread pudding but none of the consistency and texture and slightly different, sometimes milder, flavor than normal bread puddings.The service was pretty spectacular too, bringing merry and cheer to the tables around them letting everyone in the restaurant have a good time.Protip: Try the bread pudding with the dark chocolate souffle sauce or vice versa.",4 star rating,Derek B.

5/16/2013,"Brandon, SD","Visited two weeks ago for my husband's birthday lunch.  Great experience -- we went at 2:30 pm on a weekday and it was nearly empty (they close at 3 pm before reopening for dinner).  So it was quiet and we had very attentive service.  I had the Palace Pasta Royale, which was a penne pasta dish with steak strips and a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was an excellent meal, super-delicious and the lunch serving was perfectly sized.  The steak was tender, very flavorful, and complemented by the mushroom sauce perfectly.  My husband had the blackened fresh Louisiana redfish -- and it was very fresh (apparently it had just gotten in that morning).   He loved it.  Lunch came with some mini-muffins (had one jalapeno and one banana-walnut), which were good -- nothing spectacular, but took just enough edge off of our hunger as good appetizers should.  For dessert we tried the dark chocolate souffle which was perfect -- they brought it out on a big white platter with a scoop of ice cream, lit candle, and a happy birthday wish in beautiful chocolate calligraphy.  The server ceremoniously broke open the top crust of our dessert, and poured a rich bourbon cream sauce into the steaming chocolate souffle.  It was delicious -- not too sweet that you couldn't really experience all the rich chocolate flavor, but just sweet and creamy enough to feel pretty sinful.",4 star rating,Erica C.

My favorite part was during the sing-a-long when all the workers toast with every diner. Truly an amazing dining experience!! We ordered the Cajun crawfish popcorn (YUM!) and shared the ""all the best"" plate for 2. Everything was so delicious and I barely had room for dessert. The bread pudding soufflé was soooo good and the waitress even had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it! I highly recommend this restaurant, especially for special occasions!",5 star rating,Dani C.

We popped into San Luis Obispo but either nothing stood out or we were just both not hungry. We made our way to Santa Barbara, where it was obsolutely pouring in the very dark night. We walked around a bit in the rain but something kept pulling my wife to the place with the long line. I thought it was some bar but it was a cajun spot! They told us 45 min and we still had another 2 hours to wait. With the rain, several people put in their names but then left (you have to wait outside). Only 15 min later, and we were seated!I inquired about the redfish and they happened to have it. I like to try new types of food (I've never been to New Orleans) and this is one of the best discoveries in a long time! It was blackened to perfection! Probably one of the best fish I've ever had! My wife went with the jambalaya and that was excellent.We couldn't resist ordering the bread pudding and I know many people have commented about how wonderful it was but to us, it was just ok.

The ""all the best"" platter - excellent way to sample the signature seafood dishes all together on one plate. Coconut shrimp was plump and juicy. Blackened salmon was good. Crawfish étouffée was tasty. The best item though was the soft shell crab. Mmmm well seasoned, lightly battered, crispy and juicy. Bread pudding - Yes the best bread pudding I've ever had. Mix with the ice cream for a nice hot cold contrast. The service and ambiance - probably the best part of the experience. Wait staff was so nice. We all sang a song and clinked glasses during dinner. Then they surprised me by writing happy birthday in chocolate on the bread pudding platter. Very sweet. Overall, we left happy and very full.

We were recommended this spot by a few locals and it was indeed pretty good.I agree with most the other reviews and can be quoted as saying ""the food is pretty good, but if you've been to Nawlings it ain't shit.""  I'm a spicy food fanatic and this was not spicy at all. Like a 2 or 3 on the 10 scale. (I eat 10, I want the hot without compromising the flavor...)We got the Sampler for 2 which comes with the coveted bread pudding. But the sampler bread pudding has some special thanks written in chocolate syrup. The reg has no chocolate at all...it is my opinion that the hint of chocolate balances the whiskey in the pudding and makes the desert.

Everything was cooked to perfection, and each dishes came with two tasty mini muffins. Our total came to around $35 dollars.If you visit the Santa Barbara visitor center, they give you a map, and on the map is a voucher for a FREE dessert (the Bread Pudding Souffle, which is SO good).

8/16/2014,"San Pedro, CA","Still yummy after all these years. I had been an occasional patron back in the mid-to-late 1980s when The Palace Grill first opened its doors. Was in town yesterday, August 15th, to quietly enjoy a lunch of blackened catfish and celebrate a personal milestone with dessert and Café du Monde chicory coffee.The blackened catfish was satisfying but could have used a bit more spice and seared blackening. It just wasn't blackened enough, but still tasty and satisfying.I learned that the catfish came with rice and potatoes -- double starch -- and waitstaff were kind enough to let me have vegetables in lieu of potatoes.My only dissatisfaction was that twice the hostess approached me to take my plate. The first time, I might have eaten just half of my meal. I had merely set down my utensils -- I don't enjoy wolfing down my food and, because I was sitting alone at lunch (with the restaurant hardly full, though with a nice collection of patrons), I am not sure why I was being rushed. She then approached me again ten or fifteen minutes later. I was not done. Whatever happened to waitstaff being aware that refined diners will place their utensils at 10 to 4 to signal that they are done? How to avoid this uncomfortable intrusion? Is this because I was a single diner? My business is good; I dine out frequently, and I always tip well -- 20% plus on average; more if service is exceptional.Palace: please rectify this.",4 star rating,Viktoria B.

The gumbo was pretty tasty, but the popcorn shrimp batter was a bit too bready for my taste. We got the étouffée at the suggestion of the waitress. We thought it was ok, maybe we aren't as in to traditional Cajun?We both loved the crayfish pasta. Great sauce. Large portions (even for the smaller size). The Louisiana bread pudding was a bit disappointing. I thought it'd be a bit more moist, it tasted a bit over baked and more like a cake than a bread pudding.",4 star rating,melissa c.

We loved the casual atmosphere, including the funky paintings on the wall and playing cards on the ceiling.There was nothing casual about the service though. Our wait person, Keith, was charming, attentive and informative. Service was prompt, yet we did not feel rushed.We shared an order of Oysters Palace - six oysters baked in the half shell with a mixture of Louisiana Crawfish Tails, Mushrooms, and Green Onions, topped with a Jalapeño Beurre-Blanc Sauce. Yummy! My main dish was the Crawfish Etouffee, a dish I had not had since my first visit to New Orleans. Keith had assured us that all dishes are made to order, and ingredients could be omitted and spice and heat added to our taste. I asked for my Etouffe to be on the mild side, and it was perfect. My friends had the Jambalaya, Scallops and one of the pasta dishes, and we were all very pleased with our choices. We did save room for the bread pudding souffle, and it was worth it. Again attention to detail was appreciated - ""welcome to the the Palace Grill"" was written in chocolate sauce around the edge of the platter!This place is a bit pricey, but I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone who loves cajun cooking.",5 star rating,Carol D.

Gumbo: Perfectly seasoned with an irresistible smokey flavor. That's the way it should taste.Bread Pudding Souffle was decadent and delicious.

I like that they use fresh spinach in their preparation.

11/18/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Oh my - it doesn't get any better than this place. Been coming here for years - and I drive from LA to visit this a couple times a year. They have gone through a couple rough patches over the years training what seems to be like a whole new crew - but year over year best Cajun outside New Orleans. Cajun popcorn - that's crawfish, not to miss.  Red fish - yes please and lots of it - and it's fresh and truly red fish.  And that bread pudding - to die for. Why folks want to hate on this place - I don't understand. I've eaten at 5 star places in LA/NY, etc that I wanted to throw the food on the floor.And frankly they wouldn't care if I did.  If anything was wrong here they'd grab it back up and make it right in a heartbeat.  And don't forget the Cajun martinis - just one though unless you want to sleep there!",5 star rating,Cheryl S.
5/25/2014,"Goleta, CA","The rundown: Overpriced. Food is a little better than what is served at Cajun Kitchen. What's with the sing-alongs???As someone who grew up in Louisiana and lived in New Orleans and its suburbs for a number of years, I'm a creole food snob. Everytime someone asks me where I'm from and I say Louisiana, they respond with some anecdote about this place. I've lived in Santa Barbara for nearly two years and held off on trying this restaurant because I feared I would be disappointed and indeed I was.This restaurant just irks me. It tries too hard. The atmosphere makes me cringe, and it pains me that some people have somehow gotten the impression that all of New Orleans' restaurants are like that. Truly, someone asked me if they sing and toast in New Orleans restaurants like they do at the Palace Grill.The food is alright, although I was disappointed with the gumbo- it was rich and salty in a way that screams ""beef stock concentrate"" and didn't have a deep flavor from a well developed roux. The bananas foster dessert was pathetic, just lukewarm sliced bananas swimming in a thin pool of butter and sugar. I had a bite of my friend's bread pudding souffle and that was pretty good. I give the Palace Grill a thumbs up for having decent selection of Abita beer, but a thumbs down for not having a sazerac on the drink menu.",2 star rating,Katie P.

6/15/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Came here with as a group of four friends on Friday after an extremely heavy night of drinking downtown for a friend's birthday. The atmosphere is great and the waitresses are very nice. As for the food, a lot of it was his or miss. For drinks, my friend definitely enjoyed his mango Arnold Palmer so if you like that sort of stuff, I'd definitely recommend it was it was very tasty. For the appetizers, we got the cajun crawfish popcorn (was good, ""sauce is the boss""), onion string fries (small but for $4, what do you expect?) and the oyster palace (which totally sucked because the sauce overpowered the oyster and you couldn't even taste it, $12). I made the mistake of going for the soft shell crab po boy. It was definitely lacking in soft shell crab and had way way too much cabbage. The ratio was off. The rest of my friends went with a variety of pastas/jambalayas, which were all very tasty from what I recall.Since it was my friend's birthday, they brought out some ice cream + cream, all decorated in chocolate lettering which spelled out ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"". This by itself is the sole reason why I am giving Palace Grill four stars instead of three. The chocolate was SO rich, I loved it. I'm definitely going to come back to try the bread pudding souffle. Will update once I try it!",4 star rating,Justin V.
8/16/2011,"San Francisco, CA","After eating here for the first time this past weekend, it has now been added to the ""I have to eat here every time I come to Santa Barbara"" list. My friends & I had the following and each were really good: - Palace Sampler Platter: (this a good dish if it's your first time there.. you get to try a little of everything)Chicken Tchoupitoulas (my favorite thing on the plate, except the chicken was a bit dry but the sauce makes up for it)Caribbean Coconut ShrimpBlackened Catfish (so good! melt in your mouth, literally)Blackened Filet with Cajun Hollandaise.- Jumbalaya Pasta- Louisiana soft shell crab (really jhum!)- Blackened fresh Louisiana redfish- Louisiana bread pudding souffle (de-freakin-lish!)The main complaint that I have would be for my friend's redfish dish. It was really good, but pretty expensive. I mean, $30 for fish?? That's a bit steep. Even the soft shell crab dish was cheaper. I've only been here once but be prepared to wait. They open for dinner at 5:30. We got there at 6 and the place was already filled and had to wait another 30 min. But the wait was worth it.",4 star rating,Krystle A.

6/14/2009,"Long Island, NY","I ate her with my friend and her family after her graduation from UCSB this past weekend. I noticed a sign outside of the restaurant that stated that you had to have made a reservation in advance for a table that night. Our table of fourteen was crammed against the wall which didn't really bother me except for when I had to make my friend's parents get up every time I went to the bathroom. I felt bad so I tried holding it as long as I could. With my thimble size of a bladder it royally sucked. Another thing I noticed is that the restaurant was extremely loud. Didn't help that I was experiencing a particularly painful headache when we first sat down. The din was almost deafening, but it was all from the happy graduates and their families so I won't complain too much about that. All the decor is interesting and entertaining. One of their pictures framed is that of a neon dog which I have taken the liberty to claim as a corgi. Adorable!The menu was a set one which gave you choices for an appetizer, main course, and desert. With two whopping options of either $40 or $50. No other menu was offered. I'm guessing it's because of all the large groups. I picked the oysters, scallops, and chocolate souffle as my appetizer, main course, and dessert respectively. I loved the way the oysters were prepared, with a generous helping of creamy delicious sauce and spinach. When the plate of scallops was put in front of me initially, I wanted to smack my friend for dragging me to a restaurant that was charging me $50 for five scallops that could fit in the palm of my hand all together. For $50 I was hoping for a mound of scallops. I wanted to drown in $50's worth  of scallops. Then I actually tasted them and wanted to cry tears of happiness. Melt in your mouth perfection. Okay fine, I get it... you pay for quality and quality trumps over quantity. The quantity just left me craving for more.Not a big fan of the chocolate souffle. I don't enjoy stuff where I can taste the alcohol cooked in it. My friend got a special plate where they had written 'Happy Graduation' in chocolate. Overall, I left happily satisfied and not wishing I was dead because I'd engorged myself on some huge portion of food. So in the end I'm happy that their servings are smaller than usual. The entire table had a blast doing the singalongs. Drinks were done well. Tasty yet strong in my opinion. Overall I thought it was the perfect place to have a graduation party. I would most definitely come back any day of the year though.",5 star rating,Arianne N.
8/23/2009,"Redwood City, CA","We had a great experience at Palace Grill. Our waiter, Keith, made our whole evening. He was peppy and very helpful. Just fun to talk to...he gave us good recommendations for entrees----crab cakes vs. jambalaya. Of course, we had to order a souffleé and he wrote ""Welcome to Palace Grill"" on the plate. He also was kind enough to send us home with a few more of those great muffins!! (The molasses and the jalapeno muffins were the best, although the apricot had little pieces of fruit in it; it was sweeter.) Without knowing anything about the Palace before entering, this was a very good choice. Oh, I almost forgot, at 7:00, they passed out the words to a song, which we couldn't peek at until they announced it. The song was ""It's a Wonderful World"" and all employees walked around and clinked glasses with the patrons. A very pleasurable time was had!

From beginning to end the hospitality at the Palace Grill is nothing like I have ever experienced! They do not take reservations, but waiting is not an issue since there is a roaming magician (and good one at that) performing tricks for guests outside. Our server's friendly presentation and upbeat attitude remained consistent throughout our meal.The food is cajun/creole and by far the best flavor profile I've had in cajun cooking. Recommended:Crawfish Crabcake with jalapeno cream sauce is unbelievable! A little buttery, crunchy, savory, with a jalapeno kick does wonders on the palette!Jambalaya: Insanely flavorful and loaded with goodies i.e. shrimp, andouille sausage. Definitely one of those dishes that taste even better the day after.Cocktails: Your martini with come with its own (large) mason jar filled with the leftovers. So plan on refilling your glass several times after that. Oh! And if you are visiting for dinner, plan for a sing-a-long with a wait staff. :)Honorable mentions: Don't pass on the bread!

Live music on occasion is an added plus and on top of that the food is pretty dang good!One visit in particular stands out in my mind:My folks and several other relatives were visiting had made reservations several months in advance (they live out of the country and communication can be spotty sometimes, and my father really likes to plan things in advance). During this period between when the reservation was made, and our dinner date, the Palace Grill ceased to accept reservations. Anyone who has been there knows that on a Friday or Saturday evening knows there is a line down the block! The Palace tried for a couple of months but could not get ahold of my father to alert him of the reservation situation change. We showed up on Friday evening to a daunting line, a bustling restaurant, and no hostess or reservation book at the door. The initial response from the first server we encountered was a look of confusion and panic and a ""I'm-- Uhh-- We don't take reservations..."", then out of nowhere the manager, with whom the original reservation had been make --3 whole months before!-- emerged and ushered us to our table by the window.

5/23/2013,"Northridge, CA","I was very excited to find this very cute place just a few steps off of State Street. I'm a big fan of Cajun food and for there to be seats available for Sunday lunch was awesome. The prices seemed very reasonable given the neighborhood and the food offerings. I knew immediately that a soft-shell crab po' boy was my choice. The hubby picked the jambalaya -- with pasta? When the server took his order, she asked if he wanted the bread pudding souffle or some other souffle. He took that to mean that it was a part of his meal. Turns out, it wasn't. So we paid extra for the bread pudding which was not bad, but not as custardy as I like. I also ordered the fresh lemonade. My beverage came but it tasted like it was turning. When I mentioned it to the server, she said, ""Yeah, I tasted it this morning and it did seem a little fizzy."" Wow. Wonder why she never thought to mention it to the kitchen? Or me? It was replaced promptly, though, so no harm, no foul.My po'boy arrives and I knew things were not going to be great when I couldn't actually see the crab inside this huge roll. I'm very concerned with bun to filling ratios and this one was not good. I could barely taste the crab for all the bread. And the sauce was drowned out by the pickles. My husband enjoyed his jambalaya which also came with two little muffinettes -- one was cornbread and the other was not identifiable -- dark like a zucchini or banana bread? We couldn't tell because it was just super sweet. Service was very attentive but I had to tell about 12 different people that I REALLY didn't want my water refilled.

For starters the decor of the restaurant is horrendous. Consisting of dozens of old boxes cafe du monde beignet mix, a few sad strand of old mardi gras beads, and a motley collection of incongruous wall hangings.  We ordered their famous ""jalapeño"" martini. It came in a quaint mason jar, but consisted of the cheapest rot gut vodka, a fact that the waiter, oddly enough, eagerly admitted. The basket of muffins offered gratis, were tasty enough. The ""famous"" popcorn crawfish appetizer, marked MP in the menu were heavily over breaded and nowhere near fresh. The jambalaya was nothing more than a slop of dried overcooked chicken on a bed of dirty rice. Finally for dessert the ""famous"" bread pudding soufflé was also dry and overcooked.

So I went straight for the $75 ""All The Best"" Sampler. It says good for 2 but seriously, that thing could feed 3 or even 4 people if you're not looking to get super stuffed. We only finished a little more than half of the plate but enjoyed every single bite.Add a bottle of Voginer and I was ready for bed after my meal.I couldn't ask for more when it came to the service. Loved our waitress. I think it was the owner/manager but he checked up on us a few times. The guy has a great sense of humor.Thanks for making my first Cajun experience a great one. I woke up the next morning wishing I took some of my plate to go! Probably saw crawfishes dancing around in my dreams too....",4 star rating,Ken N.
8/15/2010,"Woodland Hills, CA","Just added a new favorite restaurant to the list! Came here for lunch and it was a lot less hectic than dinner time. The night before the line was out the door. Lunch time was perfect to try something new. Ordered the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn which was awesome. Loved the batter, it was light and flavorful. For the main course ordered the Creole Crawfish Crabcakes. Wow, probably one of the best crabcake I have ever had. The crawfish gives it a great flavor. It was topped with a Jalapeño Beurre-Blanc Sauce along with a side of veggies and rice. And of course the mini muffins -- the banana ones were warm and moist, very flavorful. My friend ordered the Big Easy BBQ Beef Po'boy sandwich -- it was ok. We both agreed that Crawfish is a must t to try here. It's definitely a place I would come back to -- maybe save room to try the Soufflé.",5 star rating,Dilly D.

12/3/2012,"Napa, CA","Let me start off by saying that this is one of my favorite restaurants in town and that I have eaten here many times. The food is AMAZING, the entertainment is hilarious and the dessert is the best I have ever eaten. I really have no criticism other than the fact that some entrees are a bit too spicy... but that should be expected of cajun cuisine. If you are looking for negativity you wont find it in my review. You should really go on the weekend when they do the sing-along and have the magician do card tricks. If you can only make it during the week, the food, drinks and dessert can stand on their own. They give you a basket of muffins at the start of the meal, two of each flavor but make sure to fight people in order to try them all.GET THE BREAD PUDDING SOUFFLE. It will change your life. Do not get the chocolate souffle, I have heard bad things about it but haven't strayed away from the Bread pudding souffle long enough to try it.If you have a birthday to celebrate GO HERE. If you have free time and you are hungry GO HERE. Oh and I've heard the drinks are strong and in large quantities, so that could be a big PLUS too.",5 star rating,Natalie W.
5/14/2012,"Pasadena, CA","We went here on a Saturday night and was immediately seated.  Our waiter provided us with his personal suggestions which basically consisted of the entire menu.  We started our meal off with the crawfish fries which was good but in my opinion but lacked some flavor.  It was basically crawfish meat covered in their breading and deep fried.  It came with a side of sauce which added the flavor to the appetizer.  As far as the dinner bread was concerned, the Palace Grill provides you with five different muffins for your dinner.  The muffins came out warm still and they all were excellent.  I ordered the jambalaya over a bed of dirty rice.  The flavor of the jambalaya was great.  It consisted of pieces of chicken, sausage, fresh shrimp, and I think crawfish.  What really stood out was the freshness of the meat inside the stew.  You can tell that the shrimp was fresh and cooked to order.  The only negative minor thing about the platter was that they could add a little more dirty rice to it.  The service was great.  Our waiter consistently checked on us throughout our dinner.  I don't have a lot of experience with Cajun/Creole food but I thought this place was great all around.",4 star rating,PAQMAN P.

7/30/2017,"Long Beach, CA",The reason I gave four vs five stars is because of the service. I came here during a weekend visit to Santa Barbara. We got to the restaurant closer to closing time and we were seated right away.  I think the time might have influenced our waiter's behavior because she seemed inattentive and a little grumpy. We felt like we were being rushed. The food however was excellent and I really enjoyed the warm mini muffins. The rosemary flavored ones were my favorite. Even though I enjoyed the food I don't know if I would come back though because of the service. However I wouldn't discourage anyone who wanted to go. Try it out yourself.,4 star rating,Shanda E.

Lunch is smaller portions (and cheaper). but similar items. The menu is helpful with the bestselling items printed in boxes.If you go for lunch entrees, you can have their fresh baked muffins (banana & cheese, both were too good).This place is unique in service since all their staff waits on all the tables, so there are plenty of people to help you out.the person who took our order was super sweet and even pointed out that the city guide map had a coupon for free bread pudding, yayy!We ordered the gumbo, jambalaya, blackened salmon, and their martini was delicious!Lunch portions are smaller than dinner ones, so an entree and appetizer could be fairly filling.The ambience is great with very mardi gras vibes and they have live street side jazz on weekend nights.

9/18/2012,"Stockton, CA","Went at 530pm on a Saturday. If you're not their early, don't think its worth the wait.I had the gumbo ya ya and my girl had the seafood gumbo as an apettizer. We liked mine but hers wasn't all that good, there was more rice than seafood.They bring out these muffins as well with the apetizers. They're various flavors, I liked the sweet molasses ones.I had the fusilla pasta, and my girl had the jambalaya pasta. Hers was ok (she wasn't a big fan of the place). Mine was decent, it had good flavor but more eggplants than chicken. They said I could get it spicy and I thought that's what I ordered but it wasn't that spicy, the waitress bought me some more spices to lively it up.The highlight of the experience there is the bread pudding souffle. It is delicious! It redeemed some of the letdowns from the dinner. It's definitely worth stopping by to try on its own merits, chocolate sauce and whiskey cream sauce were delicious with the bread pudding.Overall the experience was decent. The hospitality is great, the atmosphere is pretty cool, they have everyone in the place sing along to a song while the staff goes around and toasts all the guests. I don't think its worth the long wait I saw some people outside experiencing (although they do have a zydeco band playing music as you wait).",3 star rating,Demetrius G.

It is very loud though because people are drinking and talking and laughing, pretty much like Mardi Gras if you have been to New Orleans, however I have to be 100% honest with you, if you are looking for an authentic hot and spicey fried cajun meal, you may not want to come hear for that because it really isn't the best Cajun Food that I have had but it is very good. If you make it in on a Friday or Saturday night you will get to see the famous magician who...well I can't say (Spoiler Alert) you'll see.

Bread Pudding Souffle. I asked to substitute the sweet potato pie because, it's sweet potato pie. The service is usually stellar and I expect it to be stellar, so when the service was good/good enough, I was a bit disappointed. Our waiter seemed rushed/impatient. The food was yummy so if you like variety, this is your dish! Loved the sing-along part of the evening where we all sang It's a Wonderful World.

It was served with basic steamed veggies and boiled potatoes. Boring. The men had the jambalaya that was not great either. We were hoping the jambalaya would be a slam dunk at a Cajun place, but it was not. None of the food tasted fresh. The fish was indeed frozen after inquiring with the waiter. The best thing was the muffin variety basket they bring to the table. The oysters were good. We also ordered the specialty martini, tasted like a normal dirty martini. Nothing special for $12. The bill was super expensive for blah food. I gave 3 stars solely for their great service and hospitality.",3 star rating,Kirsten E.

We finished the muffins because they are also delicious--my favorite one is the jalapeño cheddar. My entree last night was the lamb chops which was incredible. The lamb was done medium which was pink and delectable and served with mashed potato and veggies. Everything was seasoned so well--I'm not sure why more people don't review the lamb! I couldn't help but to finish my entire meal. My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which is also one of our favorites (add some extra Tabasco on top if you like spice).

2/20/2012,"Santa Monica, CA","Disclaimer: I worked here while in college. To this day, this was the best, most fun job i've ever had! That being said, my review might be slightly bias, but I feel the palace is so deserving of it's 5 star review from me. I was visiting sb this past weekend and told my bf we HAD to eat here. He was initially annoyed at my insistence, but is thanking me now..We started with the crawfish popcorn, which is amazing. My bf ordered the redfish, which was flown in from New Orleans that morning and I had the bbq shrimp. Both were soo so good. I was practically drinking the bbq sauce the shrimp came in and my bf scarfed down his plate. The bread pudding is a must-have if you come here- it's served warm with this whiskey cream sauce that pairs perfectly with the cinnamon and raisins in the bread pudding. I ordered the cajun martini. It comes in a mason jar and by the time the jar was empty, I'd had 3 martinis total. Not a bad deal for $9.The service is always on point and the atmosphere is very boisterous and fun.

We were unsure where we wanted to sit but decided on a spot that apparently, we were not allowed to sit in. The manager abruptly told the hostess that she could not sit us there because it was reserved for larger parties to consolidate.

We came here thinking it'd be jam packed at 530 , but it wasn't. Which is a good thing! Our waitress was super nice, she was very very attentive, but so were all the staff. We were seated in the front near the window. The ambiance is nice! There are cards glued on the ceiling, with cute southern touch (painting, lamps, etc). They serve COMPLIMENTARY muffins (different flavors) and its miniature. I remember the jalapeno with cheese, rosemary , banana walnut, molasses and something else. It was warm and the serve was nice to introduce us the various kinds. so worth it!!We ordered the creole crawshrimp popcorn. It was delicious and the sauce was out of the world amazing. I definitely reccomend this popular dish to all newbies of sb. It's good for 2 people. It took about 20mins for the appetizer to come out. (fresh!)Our second appetizer : Crabcakes was equally if not even more aaaammaaazzinngg. this is probably my favorite one. however, it's a small portion for 2 people. It comes with a side of rice. Then, we shared the grilled salmon entree with veggies and a potatoe. I have to say, for 25 bucks, i think i would say it was ok. I definitely prefer the appetizer over the entrees. But, nonetheless the atmosphere and service gives this place a 5 stars in my book.If i had a choice, next time I would just like to come and order all the appetizers over the entree. it's just that good. But, I didn't try their famous desserts. next time! We left feeling satisfied , but pass on their candy. (near the door, it tastes like toothpaste)would i come back? yescash only? no, accepts plastic! amex included!great service! the owner walks around and greets everyonethis friday night , a magician was there too! saturday evenings they have a live band.easy parking if you come early. you can park on the streetif you're a big group, i suggest reservations. they fill up fast around 6ish.",5 star rating,Julie Z.

1/30/2014,"San Jose, CA","I was very much looking forward to enjoying   rich and tasty Southern cooking. Having been to New Orleans recently, I wanted to relive some of the delicious food I had there. I didn't expect it to be as good as the real thing, but with a 4 star rating and 600+ reviews I was looking for above average food comparable to other good Cajun restaurants on the West coast. Unfortunately our experience was not as tasty as others that have reviewed this place. Here's what we ordered:Crawfish étouffée: Although not life altering, this was the best thing at our table. There was an abundant amount of crawfish and the flavors were almost there. The vegetable side was underwhelming, plain boiled sliced carrots and zucchini, and muffins were just ok.Jambalaya Pasta: This is probably one of the worst things I've had at a restaurant in a while. It looked and tasted like boiled pasta from a box smothered with some canned veggies and pasta sauce in a jar that they added cajun spices to.Jambalaya: I didn't try this personally but all 3 people at my table who ordered it all agreed it was alright but really lacking flavor and spice.Bread Pudding Soufflé: Several reviews raved about this, calling it a must try. They even had signs in the restaurant promoting it. Perhaps whoever was making our was new or having a bad day, but after waiting over 15 minutes for our soufflés they finally came out...overcooked. We ordered 4 for the table and a couple of them looked dry, almost like bread rather than bread pudding.",2 star rating,Christine T.

They hand out song cards and tell you not to open until the music start.  About 5 minutes later Louie Armstrong's It's A Wonderful World comes and you open the card and sing along.  There is a part where it says toast, so you toast and the staff come by to toast every table.  AWESOME! Everyone loved it.  Popcorn shrimp appetizer is a must have.  I got the chicken masala, that was delicious and very Cajon.  Others at the table had jambalaya, étouffée and chicken tch.......

2/22/2014,"Carmel, CA","""All the best platter,"" is truly the best platter at the Palace Grill. It's definitely more than enough for two people and you'll get to try a little of everything. None of the flavors overwhelm each other which is an extra bonus. We also had the Original Oyster Rockefeller as an appetizer and really enjoyed it. I was concerned the hollandaise sauce was going to over power the oyster, but the blend of spinach and pernod created a nice flavor. We ended the night with the Louisiana bread pudding soufflé (included in the platter). The extra touch of hot whiskey cream creates a deliciously moist soufflé. If you love dessert, you should definitely try this one!",5 star rating,Claudia C.

8/8/2017,"Santa Monica, CA","My husband and I just had a mini vacation in the past weekend. We had been wanting to check The Palace Grill out for a while, as we had a very good experience with Cajun Food a few years ago in New Orleans. i called them for a reservation while we were driving to Santa Barbara from Santa Monica. I was told that no reservation was needed.  We rolled into Santa Barbara shortly after one o'clock on Friday afternoon 8/5. We noticed there were many cars lining up outside of the city parking lot#11. We later were told by the server in the Palace Grill that day was the biggest parade in Santa Barbara of the year! It was Fiesta 2017! I can not believe we stumbled into this....though I did enjoy seeing some of the parade. Anyway, I managed to park my car in the street about two blocks away. It was 90 minutes free parking.The people at The Palace Grill were super nice and very attentive. The setups and decorations definitely are resembling places in New Orleans. We started with the seafood gumbo. The seasoned rice and seafood were perfectly cooked and they were tasty. The main courses we went for Jambalaya sauce piguante and a Shrimp filled po'boy. My Jambalaya tasted very good, The dirty rice was mixed with chicken, sausages and seasoned tomato creole sauce. It also came with plain cooked vegetables (sliced squash and carrots) and two mini muffins on the side. They were good and the portion was big. I could not finish all the vegetables and muffins. My husband said his Po'boy was good with the fried shrimp and vegetable filled Po'boy resembling the one he had in Mother's in New Orleans. It also came with chunks of fried potato. For desert we tried Louisiana bread pudding soufflé. The server suggested for us to order it when we ordered the main course as it took a while to make them. So by the time we finished our main course, the dessert was ready to serve and it came out right out of the oven.  The server opened the hot soufflé and poured the sweet creamy sauce in it. WOW, it was yummy! It has vanilla and cinnamon flavor in it. Very good!My husband had two bottle of beer (Firestone), I had two glasses of Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara). The bill came out to about $90 including the tip. Overall my experience was good. The food is not ""quite"" up to par with New Orleans best restaurants, but very close for California. I really like their service. The host Stephanie was very nice. It is worth dining at this place if you visit Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,chinesegirlinLA c.
7/28/2015,"Avondale, AZ","This place has the full package. Someone mentioned this place to me in the morning and I had a craving for gumbo to remind me of good food I had in New Orleans. I was not disappointed. I also really loved my jumbalaya. They do more than Cajun well. My friend had the chicken Marsala and it is different from the traditional. He kept raving about the flavor and tenderness of the chicken, so much that he forgot how much he wanted to buy the salad dressing from his appetizer. The staff was VERY attentive. Working as a team to serve works quite well. Enjoyed the decor too. Only negative is it can get loud. I definitely will return next time I'm in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Eric S.

After having trying the crab cakes here at the palace, I have to say they have by far the best crab cakes in this city. You must try them, at least as an appetizer. Every hour there's an opportunity to sing along to Louis Armstrong rendition of What a Wonderful World and tip your wine glasses to your neighbors and the servers/hosts. Great social and warm atmosphere. Always an enjoyable dining experience here.",5 star rating,Eunice K.

12/8/2011,"Santa Clara, CA","This could be it. The best Cajun food in the West Coast. (or at least California since I have not yet explore much of Oregon and Washington) After moving away from the South, I have yet to have any decent Louisiana fix. A simple bowl of gumbo or just  some good old jambalaya is harder to come by than a kaiseki meal. From the moment I approached the Palace Grill, I know they are onto something. The ambiance, the hospitality and the genuine of the staff seemed all so familiar. That was the reason I waited patiently for 45 minutes on a very empty stomach after a full day of hiking. I know I would regret it if I just walk away.I am glad I have stayed. This place is the real deal. Nothing fancy or extravagance just good old fashion authentic Cajun cooking. Seafood Gumbo was very comforting. Everything on the 'all the best' platter was highly enjoyable. The Soft Shell Crab, the Crawfish Etouffee and the Blackened Salmon.... all well prepared, fully flavored and completely gratifying. They have the signature boldness of Southern food but not overwhelming heavy or oily. The Bread Pudding Souffle that a lot of people raved about was indeed quite good. Tried both the dark chocolate and the original version. They are rich with just the right amount of sweetness. The whiskey cream sauce and chocolate bourbon cream sauce were wonderful. Be warned though, they are not for the weak of the heart or those with small appetite.  Even the miniature version is huge. The normal version would be a challenge to finish especially after such a fulfilling meal. Did I mention the service was spectacular? Live music while you wait. Staff were very efficient and organized. Ambiance was great. it was so full of energy and warmth. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some Southern comfort.",4 star rating,Mona W.

5/17/2016,"Garden Grove, CA","We came by recently for dinner.  Had the Jambalaya Piquante and I didn't think had a nice presentation.  The dinner was served in a fairly medium-small salad-like dish and I tasted more chicken when the dish was described as having sausage and other ingredients in it.  Also, was on a mushy bed of dirty rice which had a lot of liquid at the bottom.  I've tasted better and more flavor for what this dish is known for.  Also, I say this because the priced for this dish is $24 The service is where my dissatisfaction begins.  We started having a very nice server but she hung around only to take our order and then disappeared only to return to our table at the end of our dinner.  We didn't see this server in the middle of our dinner.  We had to flag someone else to give us more water.  We really wanted this to be a great dining experience.  We couldn't help noticing our server being gone while we could see other servers monitoring their stations of tables while ours was somewhere else.  The manager was very fun and talkative which I really loved.  I gave 3 stars because the food taste OK and the manager was sort of making up for the lost server.  Will I be back, maybe.",3 star rating,Epi I.

After all, when one of the reviews posted outside claimed that the restaurant was ""one for the Rolodex"" (!) we couldn't help but have high hopes. Besides which, you couldn't hardly see through the window for all the Zagat stickers. The ambience was high-energy, and the service excellent - the food, though, was ordinary. My wife and I shared The $75 Sampler - the shrimp and soft shell crab were good +. The crawfish étouffée was average + . The salmon was poor, (bland, overcooked), and the dipping sauces were blah. The bread pudding desert was good.For me, the whole point of Cajun food is that it's not California food - not toned down for the masses - The Palace is Cajun food prepare so as not to offend anyone - sensible, but uninspiring.",3 star rating,James C.

4/28/2018,"Bakersfield, CA","This could have been a fun, lively experience.  Started off with a good Cajun martini, group singing in the restaurant, great service... blackened red fish was delicious but all side dishes, the potatoes and vegetables, were cold... disappointing.  My husband's steak was cooked to the right temperature, medium rare, but also just luke warm, meaning the outside also not even close to hot, like it had been cooked earlier in the day and then just slightly warmed up for plating. His potatoes and vegetables also room temp.... so disappointing. Not to mention, we were served our dinners probably within 5 minutes of ordering. With cocktail, dinner, dessert, we were in and out in less than an hour... didn't have to pay for parking because the first hour is free, and this all included walking to and from parking lot, a block away!  While I like good service, this was a bit rushed. Had food been hot, maybe I'd feel differently. Also, the bread pudding soufflé isn't what it used to be... over cooked, as in dry, but at least it was piping hot...",3 star rating,Lynn H.

12/25/2015,"Carpinteria, CA","The last time I ate at The Palace Grill was about 6 years ago. So I decided to dine there last week.  I'm a New Orleans native so I have the palate of the Big Easy.   Six years ago the food was enjoyable,not authentic, decent.  Last week was a different story. The mini muffins were over baked and hard.  They tasted like it came from a cheap muffin mix not homemade. The seafood gumbo had finely minced pieces of seafood that was the size the tip of a pencil.   I saw one microscopic size crawfish and something that looked like tiny pieces of chicken and fish.  Nothing like the description on the menu.  The Bananas Foster dessert had clumps of undissolved sugar and the caramel sauce became a gloppy clumpy mess against the ice cream.  No bourbon flavor no caramelized bananas.  No flavor.  The banana pudding souffle was over baked, and extremely dense. It tasted like wet wheat bread. The sauce that came with it was as if they took melted ice cream, added water to thin it out and added a tiny drop of bourbon extract.  Just horrible!!  I've seen this so many times with restaurants in the Santa Barbara area.  They cut quality and increase cost and assume no one would know or care.  My bill came to $74 for two people, so I do care!   Again another disappointing eating experience in Santa Barbara.",1 star rating,Lajaune W.

No one was happy.  It was an hour near closing for lunch but still.  The original waitress never helped. The second waitress had an attitude and dressed a bit revealing.

I ordered grilled salmon and he ordered some kind of jambalaya pasta- it had chicken, shrimp, sausage and a spicy tomato sauce. Both dishes were really tasty and very fresh. They give you several different kinds of muffins too. He loved the molasses raisin one. I liked the cheesy jalapeño corn bread. We didn't get dessert because we were stuffed but I will next time. Other tables had some good lookin desserts. They have a big selection of local wines and the atmosphere is great. I'm so glad our hotel recommended this restaurant.

Unfortunately, the palace pasta was not as tasty as everyone told us. It was way to much sauce on it, so the whole pasta got oily. I had the Coconut Shrimps that were very good but I did not like the sauce. The Mango Iced Tea was very tasty. And then we couldn't wait for the dark chocolate soufflé, but we haven't eaten the half of it. It didn't taste like chocolate at all and the dough was like not really baked at all. The Bailey's sauce wasn't that good too. We are very sad about it. I think this was the first and last time we've been to this restaurant.",2 star rating,Sarah F.
6/19/2018,"La Palma, CA","Wife & I were visiting my daughter and decided to celebrate her birthday and fathers day at the Palace on Friday night. It was very crowded, but we were fortunate enough to get a table fairly quickly. The server was very pleasant and we ordered. A little while later a basket of mini muffins showed up with a variety of 5 different types. My wife noticed that there was a strand of hair in the basket. We were eventually able to flag down someone to let them know. Strangely, when we told them about the hair all they said was ""ok"" and then they took the basket away. I assumed that we would get another basket, but after 3-5 minutes I was beginning to think we would not. Finally someone showed up with more muffins like nothing had happened. No apology. Eventually the server came back and she commented on the unfortunateness (word?) of getting a hair in the muffin.  My wife ordered the vegetable gumbo. When that arrived, she noticed a small piece of plastic wrap (approx 1""-2"" long) in her first spoonful. Once again we tried to alert someone. This time the response was how unfortunate that it was that she had two occurrences. They asked if she wanted a replacement but at this time she was no longer interested in their food. Since she did not eat the food, they commented that we would not have to pay for it (no kidding!). After the meal, the check arrived I confirmed that the Gumbo was removed but also assumed that maybe one of our two appetizers may have been comped. Nothing was comped. We requested to speak to the manager and he listened to our story, but showed little concern. Almost seemed like it happened regularly and we were just unlucky that both issues would happen to us. We left slightly agitated. On the plus side, the food was good, but a little expensive for the portion sizes.",2 star rating,Gary G.

The ""team"" attitude of everyone that works there made my experience wonderful. The staff was very attentive and friendly.

I had the crawfish poboy which was delicious. It was very flavorful without being to heavy as some can be. It comes with these delicious little potato wedges. I ordered the beignets, but wish I'd passed. They were hot and buried under powdered sugar but were quite thick and hard, not fluffy as I expected. The bread pudding that my friend ordered was incredible. I know why they are known for it! It melted in your mouth and had an amazing cream to pour on top.

9/23/2015,"Ventura County, CA","I've been to this restaurant many times in the past during dinner.  The service, food and music is usually excellent.  But this time, I went to The Palace during lunch today (Sept. 23, 2015) and was surprisingly very disappointed.  First off, the young hostess (in a long black gown) seated us and was not very friendly. In fact, it looked as though she didn't want to come to work today. She seems particularly perturbed that we wanted to sit at a corner table for privacy rather than a small 2 seater table that she picked for us. Then our waitress (dressed in a white chef's top with a nose ring) introduced herself. She spoke to us very fast with crossed arms (as if she herself did not want to be there for work as well!)  We tried to ask her questions about dinner prices vs. lunch prices and frankly, she seem too impatient and answered us in a flippant manner as if our questions were too stupid to be asked (though my questions were NOT stupid indeed, being that we are paying customers, we have every right to ask as many questions, ""stupid"" or not!) Nevertheless, we received our food. But towards the end of our meal, we tried flagging down either our waitress and/or the hostess. My friend and I felt that the waitress was trying very hard to ignore us and the hostess was on her lunch break! A kind red-haired manager (wearing black with a name tag) actually took over and helped us, refilled our drinks and talked to us about our concerns.  She told us that they all work as a team. Frankly, it seems to me that she was taking the slack for the hostess and our waitress because by the time we signed the food bill and started leaving, the hostess was serving another table and our prior waitress was being friendly and serving another table. We did not even get a ""Have a Good Day"" comment from the hostess as we left. It was like they were both saying by body language: ""Good Riddance! We'd rather service THESE customers!""Bottom line:  We left there feeling like we weren't welcomed at all at that restaurant!!!  Personally, we felt discriminated against despite our casual attire (it's not as if the restaurant required a suit and tie attire!)  AND we had PLENTY of money to pay for that HORRIBLE service!!  It's a shame too because they claim that they've had acclaimed customer service for the past 28 years...Well, I believe that their customer service is not up to par as they claim...especially during lunch time.  In fact, it has gone downhill in customer service and ambience (with chairs and tables being rickety and worn out to the restaurant needing a modern face-lift!) I would reconsider coming to this restaurant again, BUT... ONLY if there was an incentive (and not a mere apology either!) The red-haired manager did not even offer a discount or a coupon for our troubles which other restaurants would do for customers who weren't happy with the food or customer service. The food is still excellent. But if LOUSY service like that continues at The Palace Grill, I prefer to spend my money and to go to other $$+ level competitive restaurants (which are many and prevalent in Ventura, LA and Santa Barbara Counties) that offer better service along with their excellent food. Don't forget there are other competitors out there and The Palace Grill would be unwise not to heed that!This restaurant does NOT care about their customers and I HATE going to restaurants that don't train their employees to care about their customers.  They unknowingly hire employees who treat customers with a ""F... You"" attitude and this restaurant is guilty of that!  What a shame!",1 star rating,Cheyenne C.

We got a few appetizers to share between the 2 of us. I'd marry their crab cakes. The coconut shrimp are monstrous and scrumptious. The fried chicken salad (not sure of the exact name) was my kind of salad -- lettuce was scarce, battered chicken was plentiful. Could not fit dessert.

4/9/2015,"Long Beach, CA","I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! The experience starts as you walk up to the restaurant and the authentic Zydeco band is playing on the sidewalk. Don't worry if you have to wait for a seat, it's never too long, and even if it takes a minute longer than hoped for, you not only have the band to entertain you, I've seen the staff bring out some appetizers to ease the wait. Which brings me to the food. Oh, the food. It will be hard, but do your best not to fill up on the variety of the amazing fresh-baked basket of bread they'll bring to your table. (My favorite is black strap molasses!) As for the meals, nothing we've had has disappointed. The red beans and rice conjured up memories of the first time I tried the dish back in New Orleans years ago, and nothing, until the Palace, has compared. The jambalaya is that perfect blend of spice that creates just the right kick, but never overpowers. Their wonderful crab cakes made up for the horrible crab cakes I had at another restaurant. Don't worry if you miss the first round of the cheers, where all the patrons are invited to join in and sing ""(What a) Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong, and all the wait staff come around to cheers you, there is sure to be another round of singing before you go.  Tip: Order THE WORLD FAMOUS PALACE CAJUN MARTINI for the cheers. I have it every time and LOVE it! If you are into dessert, definitely order the dark chocolate soufflé with chocolate bourbon cream sauce, but order it ahead of time, as the staff will suggest, so it can be timed perfectly (every time). Bottom line: We've made the drive from Long Beach to Santa Barbara to eat at the Palace for a late lunch/early dinner, just to turn around and come home afterwards, and the trip is worth it EVERY time!  You are missing out if you don't visit the palace at least once, and then again, and again!",5 star rating,Elle L.

6/11/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","There's something about cajun food that really gets my motor running.  The spices, the heartiness, the ""I'm going to use enough cream to drain a cow's teat dry"" style of heart-attackness.  For dinner on my friend's bachelor party weekend, we opted for a trip to The Palace Grill upon the recommendation of a friend.  While there were a ton of options for venues in Santa Barbara, when examining the menus we agreed that everyplace else at which we looked, we could find the same type of restaurant in LA.  And while yes, there are numerous cajun restaurants in LA, a) this one came highly recommended, and b) since his fiancee and my girlfriend weren't around, we could go nuts and eat all of the unhealthy carbs that we desired.  Sold.Another selling point?  Muffins.  Damn good muffins.  Instead of bread, the server brings a selection of freshly-baked muffins to your table.  While they were all noteworthy in their own rights, the sweet apricot and molasses were my two favorites.  The awesomely fresh whipped butter was a definite compliment... don't eat your muffins dry.  Don't EVER eat your muffins dry.For an appetizer, we ordered the cajun crawfish popcorn ($12.95).  Please note that the shellfish is now being ordered from southeast Asia due to the whole BP fiasco (jackasses).  The popcorn crawfish were recommended by everyone on Yelp, and by the server, but they were honestly comme ci comme ca (hey this is a review of a cajun restaurant, right?).  There was too much breading and not enough crawfish, and next time I would go with another option.For our main course, we split the ""All the Best"" platter ($75).  This included:-blackened salmon pontchartrain topped with crawfish tails -- While the salmon was slightly overcooked, the spice rub was quite tasty, and the sweetness of the crawfish with the cream sauce blended very nicely to give the dish a full-bodied, slightly sweet taste.-spicy crawfish etouffee -- My friend doesn't eat spicy food, so we ordered this mild.  It was mediocre.  This was a small amount of crawfish, with a large portion of rice.  The crawfish had good flavor, but there wasn't much to go around.  Don't be so stingy with the shellfish friends!-soft shell crabs -- Two in the order.  I love soft shell crab, although this was a little heavy on the cornmeal batter.  We both agreed that we would have enjoyed this dish more had there been less breading, but it was still good, and the chipotle-ish dipping sauce was excellent (if a little heavy on the cream).-Caribbean coconut shrimp -- Three large butterflied shrimp, perfectly fried in a deliciously sweet coconut batter.  This was both of our favorite dish, and the marmalade horseradish dipping sauce was excellent... sweet and delicious.As part of the combination, we also received a bread pudding souffle for dessert.  It was delicious, especially when we poured a heavy helping of the vanilla cream sauce on top.  Perfectly sweet and simultaneously savory, this was a fantastic way to end the meal.  We thought about getting an order of the key lime pie in addition, but we were both so stuffed that it would have been a stretch (to our waists).  Considering that we are talking about two big eaters, this was the appropriate amount of food.I also had a freshly-brewed lemonade, which was sweet and refreshing in the face of all of the heavy creams and fried foods.  After dinner, I had a double-espresso, which was like drinking dirt... and it wasn't even chicory.  Don't order this if you're a coffee snob.Service was friendly, although our waitress spoke so softly that it was difficult to hear her... and the place was relatively empty since we came so late (10pm dinner).All in all, a very tasty dinner, with some very interesting takes on traditional cajun cuisine.  Yes, it's a little overpriced, but the quality of the ingredients was great and hey, free muffins... delicious muffins... with delicious butter.  I'd go back just for the muffins.  4 stars.",4 star rating,Ryan J.

11/13/2007,"San Francisco, CA","The Palace Grill!  I have been hearing about this place literally for MONTHS because my boyfriend was so excited to visit Santa Barbara and go back to his favorite restaurant.  He gave it 5 stars and I have to agree!This place gets busy, being a classy restaurant in beautiful downtown Santa Barbara, so they make it first-come first-serve.  First of all, they have a live band playing outside while you wait in line, with an accordian player and this cool instrument that's basically one string and a barrel.  Playing one string and making it sound like a bass guitar - that takes a lot of skill!  The staff was all friendly and the host even recognized my boyfriend and gave him a hug (after he hasn't lived in Santa Barbara for eight months??  Tells you how often he ate there!)Then, they bring you the muffins.  There are SO many different kinds, and you can't try them all because you're trying to leave room for dinner, but they're soooo tasty and very creative!  There was a jalepeno muffin, pecan, zuccinni, and... I don't remember what the others were, because I didn't get a chance to try them, but every bite I had was straight out of muffin heaven.This place is famous for their drinks, and the appetizers were phenomenal.  We had popcorn prawns and my boyfriend had the gumbo, which he said was excellent.  For dinner the guys ordered steaks, my friend got a spicy salmon dish and I had delicious veal medalions and prawns over creamy pasta.   MmMmm!  I had to order desert (their famous bread pudding) at the same time as my meal because it takes awhile to prepare.  When it came time to eat it, everyone was too full to help me out, so I had a piping hot bread pudding covered in melted white frosting all to myself... it was too much goodness for one meal, really.  I got the rest wrapped up to go :)One of the best parts of the meal was when the waiters handed out little booklets that say ""Do not open until the music begins!"" and then the whole restaurant sings together... Whennnnnn the... MOON HITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE - that's Amore!!  Especially after having a martini the size of a mason jar, people get really into it!  Plus the waiters go around to clink their glasses with every table.Overall, this restaurant was fantastic... a really fun, delicious experience, and next time I visit Santa Barbara I will definitely be going back there the first chance I get!",5 star rating,Laura W.

The WORST dining experience I have EVER had in my life. No joke.St Patty's evening, my friend Amanda and I are in SB visiting from out of town. We weren't in the mood to go out and party so we drove around looking for something quiet to just eat dinner at.This place had RAVE reviews posted outside the door. We get in and there are a few people there, and 5 servers.We get seated and a waiter brings us some muffins. He apologizes that they only have so many left for the evening (it was barely 9pm)... and explains what the different kinds are - we got 3 kinds.I go to pick up the molasses muffin and it is harder than concrete!!!!!! Like, I could have played a whole 9 inning game of baseball with this muffin! Are you serious??We laughed it off and got to the menu. Amanda couldn't decide between the Chicken Marsala and the Pecan Crusted Chicken so when the waitress came to take our drink order, she asked which the lady recommended...Marsala is what the the women raved about so that's what she ordered, with rice and veggies. I got the lamb chops with mashers and veggies.Before we go on... Can someone, please, remind me what a NORMAL Chicken Marsala recipe is??Chicken breastMarsala wine sauceMushroomsand sometimes Onion....Amanda's food came and piled on top of the chicken breast was:OnionBell pepperCELERY????Shaved CarrotsMushroomsUmmm..... What kind of Marsala is that??!! As soon as the waitress set the plate down, Amanda made it clear that this isn't what she thought she'd be getting and asked to get something else. The woman looked at her like she was crazy. No apology, no nothing. Didn't even ask what else she might want. She just turned and walked away. She went to the kitchen (open kitchen) and started taking crap about us!!! WTF?The male server came over and asked what else she might like. She asked for the Pecan Crusted Chicken with rice and veggies. She apologized for the inconvenience and made it clear that she knew it wasn't anyones fault - it just wasn't what she thought it was going to be. He said ok and walked away to put the order in. Still nobody came to apologize or make any comments. No manager, nobody.Literally THREE minutes later, out comes her Pecan Crusted Chicken. Only, it wasn't crusted with anything... It was a chicken breast covered in sauce and had some chopped up Pecans tossed on top!! How long does it take to cook a chicken breast? Even in a restaurant it takes a good 10min to FULLY cook a piece of chicken.She said whatever... Thanked the man and tried to eat this dish. Welllllll, the chicken was SO tough she couldn't cut it with the knife she had!They had literally washed off the chicken from the Marsala and put it under the broiler, poured some sauce on top, and chopped pecans!!!! It. Was. DISGUSTING.We finished... and the lady came to pick up our plates and the baseball muffins. I asked her to feel it. She said, I know... We dont have many left tonight. I said, no FEEL it, its hard as a rock! She said, I know.I asked why they would serve them then?!Her response, ""I did NOT serve these to you!""Im sorry, but if I worked at a restaurant and I KNEW that the muffins were as hard as a rock, I'd just throw them out and let people know we are out for the evening. Period. Seriously!She didnt ask if we wanted dessert or anything else, she just put the check on the table. We added our cash and waited....waitedwaitedwaited....20min later the male server comes to us with another check???? This one has a CC in it already and I ask him why he's giving it to me, that I clearly already have a check and that isnt mine. He said, yes it is.Ummmmm.... NO, its NOT. I didnt even give anyone my payment yet! Take that CC to the RIGHT table!10 more min goes buy and the manager comes up and says, ""Im guessing you want me to take this?""Uh, yeah....UGH! Seriously...

The gumbo was one of the best my husband has had. I had the diver scallops. They were a little over cooked, a bit dry and rubbery. When I mentioned that, I was told nicely in so many words to put more sauce on them. Not the thing to say. ""So, we know they are dry, smother in sauce"" attitude. They are fun. The sing along was great. Makes for a happy group. Though we didn't have a personal experience the walk around card magician looked fun.",4 star rating,Ann U.
3/21/2015,"Alexandria, VA","I met a friend for dinner at The Palace Grill.  It was my first visit and they had great food and a fun atmosphere.  We went for the first seating, so we were able to make reservations which I would recommend if you don't mind eating a little early.  I started with a Tropical Hurricane Martini, very refreshing after a warm day in Santa Barbara shopping and walking on the pier.  For an entree I got the Divers' Scallops (I appreciated being able to get an appetizer portion after having eaten a large lunch earlier in the day) and my friend got the Jambalaya.  For dessert I got the Dark Chocolate Souffle (and again, they allowed me to get the smaller lunch portion).  Everything was excellent.  The sing-a-long of Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" was a fun surprise.  They very graciously allowed my friend and I to hang around and catch up for a couple of hours without throwing us out.  I will visit again when I'm back in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Hilary B.

7/29/2011,"San Francisco, CA","I definitely agree with the previous reviewer that this place is more hype than anything else. After having been to New Orleans many times and have had the ""real deal"", Palace Grill seemed like an overpriced wannabe. We had the gumbo, which was much too bland; the crawfish etoufee, which should have been called ""pepper etoufee"" as it was doused with green pepper and very little crawfish. The only highlight of the meal was the blackened catfish, which was very fresh; however, it didn't have enough flavor to call it ""blackened"". The sides, steamed vegetables and brown rice, were really lame and ... oh yeah, the muffins were good ... then again, I wasn't there for the pastries. We were SO disappointed with the meal that we didn't even bother getting the desserts. I could tell that the staff were as accommodating as they can be; unfortunately, the place is packed; so, chances of your waiter coming back to refill your drink is slim to none. Overall, it was a huge disappointment, and waste of money better spent elsewhere in a city abundant of good restaurants.",2 star rating,S. I.
12/30/2008,"San Mateo, CA","I found this place though Yelp Mobile on my iPhone, and decided to check it out, based on all of the positive reviews. We drove by it a few times, and were turned off by the huge lines of folks standing around waiting, as it appeared that reservations were a must. After unsuccessfully going be a few other places that sounded good, we happened back by, and were seated within about 10 minutes - this was on a Monday night around 9pm.The menu looked great, and very promising, as they offered all kinds of yummy sounding plates. Service was prompt and very attentive. As it was our first time, our waiter took a moment to acquaint us with the staff pictured on the first pages of the menu, and the special items they served. He suggested a few different items, as well.We ordered the ""plantation fried chicken"" salad, as an appetizer. They had a lot of other options as well, including Gumbo which is one of my favorite things, ever. However, I didn't like the ingredients that they were using, so I passed on both the Seafood and Ya Ya Gumbos.I ordered the Jambalaya Sauce Piquante, and my girlfriend got the Penne Pasta Pontalba. Everything looked great, and we both dove right in. But the elation was short lived, as none of the dishes had any real flavor. In my opinion they weren't well seasoned, at all. I tried to doctor up my jambalaya with some hot sauce, but that didn't help, unfortunately. We'd ordered their Dark Chocolate Souffle for dessert, and the flavorless trend continued. I had a few bites, and pushed the rest away.Perhaps, I'm a bit spoiled as I was raised around VERY good cajun food, as my grand parents are from New Orleans. Living in the Bay Area, only makes matters worse, as there's a plethora of great restaurants, which only raises the bar, that much higher!",3 star rating,Jeff P.

6/2/2007,"Menlo Park, CA","Finding a solid restaurant in Santa Barbara has risks due to the tourist element and the State Street-Let's-Get-Hammered crowd. The Palace has been around awhile, which in Santa Barbara ain't long, but the place seems to be standing up well.I like places that not only make good food but care about service, and you get the Service Vibe early from the Palace. That's probably one of their strongest points: they seem to care.My only real problem is there's no bar, so you stand outside in a line in the fresh chilly Santa Barbara air. No bar is a serious flaw in my book,  but then I like drinks you can light on fire too.The Palace is Cajun and I am a Picky Sonuvabitch when it comes to Cajun. My Dad went to LSU and fed me Tabasco in the 50's so I think spicy food is a Religious Experience.The Palace delivered solid Gumbo and equally high quality Jambalaya. The pasta dishes on the menu freak me out because the last time I checked, Cajuns don't make pasta, and this is the one sketchy thing about the place. Everything at our table -- no pastas thank you -- was very good.The pony here is the drinks. Mason Jar size Martinis. Holy Shit. You can order a Quart Jar Martini and they limit you to one. I preferred to not be in the emergency ward and stuck with the Pansy Ass Mason Jar Martinis, and woo, they were terrific.Why 3 Stars? First, this is a rock solid ""Go There 3 stars"". Second, no bar, Spanky, sorry. Third, Cajun can only be so good, unless you are in New Orleans where you eat French food and Po' Boys any way. But I like it.",3 star rating,Jeff W.

I have been to Louisiana, so I know what authentic Cajun/Creole food tastes like. This is a poor randition of ""authentic"" Cajun food. I would've rather gone to a dive bar in Louisiana and paid a fraction of the price to eat some real Cajun food. The staff seemed very pushy for us to order...and it was 2 hours before closing time..so there wasn't any need to rush us. The food was on the expensive side...from $20-$35 dollars for dinner entrees and the food was bland..this is Cajun food I would expect from a ihop or Denny's. No flavor and not even close to being spicy. My wife didn't even finish her entree because it was so bland. Yes, they did take her meal off the ticket, we still paid $80. The server also kept forgetting things..didn't bring my sons A-1 sauce for a $12 kids meal...and then never even brought my coffee...I didn't bother reminding her because the food was so bland I didn't care to find out what the coffee would have tasted like.

5/27/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","My friends and I came to eat here on a late Saturday night. We expected a long wait, and sure enough, we waited approximately 1 hour to be seated.When the clock hit 10pm, a woman came to us and told us to come in for the song. She commented on how young we looked- (I won't lie, it felt good) and we were waiting patiently for the song to begin. Then the same lady came back, gave 2 glasses of wine to the people in front of us, and gave my friends and I glasses of water. WAIT.. STOP right there. You tell us we look young, ask us if we're over 21, don't even bother to card us and don't even ask us if we want some wine as well? UGH. So when the ""song"" came out and everyone was going around saying ""cheers"" with their glass of wine, we felt pathetic holding our glasses of water. Everyone in the restaurant that was over 21 had free alcohol except us. How pathetic. Already, I knew that this place was not going to get 5 stars.After the song, we continued to wait for a seat. No one budged to leave. We waited a total of an hour at least. Finally, we were seated. I ordered the Palace Carribean Rum Punch, which didn't taste as good as it sounded on the menu. My friend got the Cranberry Spin Martini which I thought was nasty. But I think most martinis are nasty..this one was no exception.The basket of muffins they serve here were AWESOME. There were 5 different flavors, 2 of each. I really liked the Rosemary muffins and the Jalapeno cheese muffins. There were banana muffins and some sweeter brown muffin, but those were ""ok.""We ordered the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn as our appetizer, which was pretty good. You couldn't really taste the crawfish unless you had the bigger pieces, but nevertheless, it was crispy and quite satisfying. We ordered the Jambalaya Sauce Picante and Creole Crawfish Crabcakes. The jambalaya was pretty good- not too spicy but was full of flavor and mixed in with rice, my favorite. The Creole Crawfish was decent, but I've had better crabcakes elsewhere. The flavored rice that came with the crabcakes didn't taste right.. this entree was quite mediocre for me.We ordered the bread pudding souffle because everyone on yelp had been raving about it. I was really hoping that our dessert would make me fall in love with this place, but it did not. We regretted not ordering the chocolate souffle because the bread pudding was nothing special, and rather disappointing. It just tasted like a warm cinnamon bun to me.Anyway, there were the good, and the bad, so this place gets 3 stars. Nothing more, nothing less. One thing for sure is that this place is bit overrated. However, I can see that it's a fun place to hang out on a weekend night.",3 star rating,Yun K.

For example there is no specific waiter/waitress for your table, instead the entire staff is there for you. They will also encourage singing throughout the night, accompanied by drinking of course. Speaking of drinks! try their ""cajun martini"" it's really good.Also, the free muffins are literally ""to die for"". They are so delicious and cute, we typically go through a few baskets before our dinner arrives. I have also purchased the muffin recipes so that I can make them myself.I've never had a dinner here that I didn't enjoy.

3/2/2017,"Goleta, CA","A local review for locals:Definitely a tourist trap now. Maybe lunch would be ok but dinner is way too expensive. The main menu items are in the mid $30's. ONE crab cake appetizer: $12. One drink: $12. This is definitely hotel high-end prices. Our local big hotels, Tee-Off, Harry's, Boathouse are in this price range but you get a lot more (food/view/service). Let's face what cajun food really is- poor peoples food. Catfish is one of the cheapest fish you can buy, rice stew, etc, etc. There is a menu page of pasta that gets the price down to $25. But three of us went there for dinner, ordered two pasta dishes and blackened catfish (with two or three rose potatoes and some sauteed zucchini which is what we make at home many nights- nothing special or hard to do and frankly we do it better), no apps, one martini to share, one bread pudding to share (that wasn't ready on time even though we ordered it on time with our meal) and voilà: $95.$15 tip and we're at $110. Really? For catfish and pasta? I'm never going back. PS my last grocery trip on Sunday for the whole week was $110 so as a percentage of food budget, this was a huge expense.",1 star rating,Richard P.
2/18/2010,"Manhattan Beach, CA","Pros: great food, great wait staff, & $10 corkage Cons: none. well maybe over eating since the food was so good. I came here last Saturday night on a recommendation from a long time SB resident and friend of mine. She was spot on with her recommendation. I've been to New Orleans 3 times and eaten some really good meals down there, so the bar was set pretty high. The Palace Grill exceeded my expectations. We started off by splitting a pint of Cajun Martini and the Cajun Crawfish Popcorn appetizer. Taking little bites of the sweet peppers in the martini added a good balance to the drink. The Crawfish were good, but the Sherry Cream dipping sauce that came with it was really good. Also upon sitting down the waiter opened our bottle of Overture (Opus One 2nd label) to let it breath. For our main courses we order the Blackened Filet and the Creole Lamb Chops. While ordering we happened to mention that we had planned to split our entrees. When the food came out the waiter had already told the cooks to spilt entrees onto 2 plates. It was a nice little touch. The Filet and all the side were good. The mashed potatoes were really good and the Lamb Chops were AMAZING. I'll rank them the top 3 or 4 lamp chops I've ever eaten. They were seasoned well. They were cooked to a perfect medium rare, yet they were fall apart tender. If you like lamb you'll love these lamb chops. Next onto the dessert. My inside source had told me that the souffle's were really good and we need to try one. We couldn't decide between the Bread Pudding Souffle with Whiskey Cream Sauce or the Chocolate Souffle with Chocolate Bourbon Cream Sauce. The waiter told us he could help out our decision by having the kitchen make us a lunch size Souffle of each kind. That sounded perfect! The souffles were really good and it also nice mixing and matching the sauces. To top it off the waiter put a side of melted ghirardelli chocolate on our mini dessert platter and then in the end he didn't even charge us for the dessert. To say the least we gave him a phat tip. It was a great meal that came along with great service. My hats off to you.",5 star rating,Scottie V.

4/18/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Went for my first time yesterday and am now a huge fan.  I was already having high expectations from the reviews of their famous souffle and all the good reviews shown outside of this establishment  Great food, great service.  Make sure you get here early if you don't have reservations!They recommend that you try their combo platter for two if you're visiting for your first time and I must admit, this is definitely the item to get. Complimentary MuffinsDivine.  You get eight different small muffins which I appreciate because I love taste testing various food items.  They were delicious.APPETIZERGet their popcorn crawfish ($12) - once you start, you can't stop.""All The Best"" Platter (for two - $75)Blackened salmon topped with crawfish tails, Louisiana crawfish etouffee, two soft shell crabs, Caribbean coconut shrimp and Louisiana bread pudding souffle with whiskey cream sauce (we changed this to their Dark Chocolate souffle).Salmon was soft and well seasoned, the crawish tails with rice was superb, soft shell crabs were good and coconut shrimp was amazing paired with their orange dipping sauce. The sauteed vegetables were delicious.  Everything was great except the dark chocolate souffle.  It was moist and not too sweet but nothing was special about it.  The taste didn't stand out like their food.  A lady was passing out cards to every table and told us not to open it until the music starts.  My friend and I looked at each other with curiosity.  When the music finally played, we opened the card to find lyrics to the song.  Then all the waiters were going to each table to toast with the patrons.  What a lovely thing they do there!  Definitely not your usual dining experience.  I plan on driving back here from LA just for this place!!!",4 star rating,Alice C.
5/10/2008,"San Francisco, CA","Absolutely my favorite restaurant in all of Santa Barbara. The service is phenomenal - all the waiters are enthusiastic, happy, and genuinely seem to love the restaurant, the patrons, and their jobs. The Cajun dishes are to die for - you can be safe ordering almost any item on the menu. When you're finished, for dessert, DEFINITELY try the bread pudding. The chocolate bread pudding is particularly scrumptious - a soft, warm pastry-like bread straight out of the oven, cracked at the top with 2 forks, and then filled with creamy warm pudding. I can't get that bread pudding out of my head! Order them early in the meal because they take a little longer to make, and by the time you're done with your main course, you're going to want it to be ready.If you can choose what day to go to the Palace, go on a Friday. You will be able to sing ""What a Wonderful World"" with all the waiters, all your friends, and everyone else in the restaurant while laughing, cheering your friends with your wine glasses, and having the time of your life. An unforgettable experience.",5 star rating,Michelle G.
2/3/2015,"Murrieta, CA","My husband and I were immediately greeted and sat and a friendly waitress came over to get our drinks in. We beat the dinner rush, so the waitress was very attentive and helped us make selections off the menu and answered our questions. Sadly, by the time she got our order in, it was like she disappeared. Granted, it got busier, but she hardly stopped at our table at all, and as we had ordered the chocolate soufflé at the same time as our meals, we wondered if she would remember to bring it to us. She did, eventually, very hurriedly cut into the soufflé and poured the accompanying sauce into it. If she had asked, maybe she would have known not to do that since I don't care for bourbon sauce, but she gave us no chance to ask what it was or offer us to do it ourselves. She was then off again and only stopped by the table to hand us the check. She clearly noticed that I had scooped out a big serving of the soufflé but left it nearly untouched on my plate, yet she didn't even ask if I liked it. The atmosphere of the place is awesome, I really liked it as a whole! Relaxed and fun. The service started out great, but, sadly, didn't follow through. The food! I had lamb chops which were delicious. Very happy with my meal. My husband was happy with his gumbo for an appetizer but felt like there was a little something missing from the jambalaya, to tie the tastes together. Overall, we would give the food (excluding dessert) 4 stars. The dessert, however, was sub par. Every time I see a chocolate soufflé on a menu, I get excited! Not everyone makes them, because they're special! This one, to my great disappointment, was not special. It was bland, and the texture was nothing like any soufflé I've tried before (supposed to have a thin crunchy shell, a light and airy filling, and finally a chocolate lava middle), but instead it was like a microwave brownie (not even a good one). I'm a huge dessert person, chocolate being my absolute favorite, and this was just not good. Add on the bourbon sauce that the waitress poured in there without asking if we would like it, and it totally sealed the deal. I took a few bites, hoping for it to get better, but finally gave up.",3 star rating,Hildur A.
10/20/2008,"Portland, OR","For our friend's birthday, eight of us got together and went out to the Palace Grill off of what we'd heard from others. Before ordering our individual meals, we all made sure to pre-order the bread pudding. The smell of it coming from other tables was irresistible!I ordered the crawfish crabcakes and a cup of seafood gumbo. Both were very tasty. The flavors in the gumbo were strong but well-balanced, and had enough spices to mask any hint of a seafood smell. The crawfish crabcakes were extremely rich. I'm sure my circulatory system has sustained permanent damage thanks to those crabcakes, but I can't say I didn't enjoy them. I do feel that if I wanted to eat more than the two crabcakes that they provided, I would've needed them to be a bit lighter and not so cheesy.The bread pudding was highly delicious, although it didn't taste like what I would call bread pudding. Nevertheless, if it's good, I sort of don't care what it's ""supposed"" to taste like...I tried some of the dishes my dining companions ordered (the scallops, a shrimp dish, and some sort of pasta dish), and they were also tasty although over-salted and over-peppered. I have come to believe that Cajun cooking must simply weight salt and pepper differently than other cuisines I'm used to.The atmosphere is very good for a group of friends, more than I imagine it would be for a date. It's very busy and every now and then the servers and diners all boisterously sing songs together like ""That's Amore"" and ""What a Wonderful World"", clinking glasses and offering cheers to everyone around them. Personally, I'm not a singer or glass-clinker, but it was still fun.Overall, I think the food was tasty but a little too rich, and all the items were overpriced. We went for dinner but it looked like the same items were available for lunch at much more reasonable prices.",3 star rating,Sameer Ud Dowla K.

5/10/2011,"Los Alamitos, CA","For being outside of Louisiana, this place is pretty good. Had the Crawfish Po'boy and the Shrimp Po'boy, we each ordered one and swapped halves. The Crawfish had a heavy batter, but was delish, and the sandwich was packed. The whole sandwich was good just the way it came, not too much mayo, lettuce or pickles. It was all just right. The Shrimp was lightly battered, and not as heavy but they did not put nearly as much shrimp in the sandwich, I think it would have been a little better if they put more shrimp in it.If I'm back in Santa Barbara, I will probably come back.",4 star rating,Jane M.
10/20/2011,"Homburg, Germany","It seems counter-intuitive that when visiting Santa Barbara we would spend one of our meals at a Cajun restaurant, but we were far from the only ones there during our visit. Prices and atmosphere were aimed towards more of a family dining level, and while everything was pretty casual, you still can't argue with the food.There's a handful of traditional New Orleans dishes here; I had a cup of gumbo to start, followed by a jambalaya. The former benefited from the nice dark roux, and some nice andouille. The latter had a sauce that was more tomato-based, and served on a plate poured over ""dirty rice"" (don't know if I saw any chicken livers in there), and was heavily seasoned and enough of a kick to tell me that The Palace isn't just a place that's looking to cash in on some unsuspecting Californians who don't know the cooking of NOLA. Despite decorating the place with boxes of beignet mix, they weren't on the menu. It seemed mean to tease me. What they did have, however, were a couple of souflées, which our server is noted would require ordering at the beginning of the meal, as it takes a half hour to cook. Someone in my party got one, and after seeing it, I wish I did, too.Near the end of the meal lyrics sheets were passed out and the entire restaurant sung Satchmo's ""What a Wonderful World."" It seemed a bit hokey, but we're outsiders - the city's best will always seem a little foreign to me.",4 star rating,Brad S.
10/26/2015,"Darien, CT","Not sure how after 10 years of eating here I have yet to review, so here it goes.. It's rare in the restaurant business that a small independent restaurant can survive for 20 plus years especially in Santa Barbara where turnovers are a monthly thing and still have people wanting to wait an hour to eat here.. But that's exactly what the Palace does.. It's amazing staff and the service they provide has people coming back time and time again.. The muffins alone are reason to come back.. Every March my friends and I all get to celebrate my husbands birthday (something my husband hates celebrating) however the annoyance of getting one year older is somewhat dimmed by the amazing food he gets to enjoy while celebrating..the crawfish popcorn, pasta jumbalya, jalapeño martinis and of course the bread pudding soufflé makes a perfect meal..

11/3/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Seriously, amaze balls. I bring anyone here if I want to impress them- one of those places where no matter what you order, it's going to be delicious. I've had the crawfish stuffed filet mignon, the jambalaya, the Louisiana redfish and the jambalaya one more time. Definitely a great place to order something outside your comfort zone, like fish for me. I don't always like fish, but this place is so good I went out on a limb, and it paid off. If they have the redfish (it often sells out!), I highly recommend it. Drinks are great too, garnished and always look beautiful- they use mason jars for some which I think is cute with their whole vibe. Order the souffle dessert with your meal.Just shut up and do it, man, it doesn't matter which one, whiskey or chocolate, they are both f**king amazing.Craw daddy popcorn? Free basket of mini muffins?

How fun is that?! Food and service were excellent. Try not to get full from the complimentary muffins! It's incredibly tempting to try all the muffins because they're all different, but trust me.. Save room for dessert!! Order the bread pudding when you order your entree because it takes that long to bake. It has apple cinnamon and just melts in your mouth *drools*.

It was alright, I definitely liked Brenda's Watermelon Iced Tea a lot better. This one just didn't have enough mango flavor, it pretty much tasted like normal, unflavored iced tea.Banana Nut & Jalapeno Cheddar Muffins. Like I've said in my previous posts, I love how this place gives muffins instead of bread. I don't care how fatty it is, they're damn good! I just wished they had more variety at lunch like they do at dinner, but I guess I am asking for a bit much. HEH.Oysters Palace. Oysters baked in the half shell with Louisiana crawfish tails, mushrooms, and green onions, topped with jalapeño beurre-blanc sauce. This was BOMB. Definitely the best baked oysters I've ever had in my life. The flavors mixed well together and the sauce was not overly creamy. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY.Soft-Shelled Crab Po'boy. Flash fried soft-shelled crab with Bienville dressing,on a House-baked French Roll with garlic mayonnaise, Creole mustard, cabbage, and pickles with a side of fried potatoes. My favorite thing here! It is BOMBBBBBBB!!! Definitely the best poboy I've ever had. The bread is really soft and delicious. The crab was fried to perfection. But best of all was the sauce! It was damn good. The delicious garlic mayonnaise and Creole mustard sauces seriously make this sandwich anything but ordinary. Crawfish Pasta Lafitte. Penne pasta with fresh sautéed Louisiana crawfish tails, caramelized onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, cream, and Creole seasonings with a side of salad. This was really good as well, I loved the Cajun spices with the crawfish and penne pasta. It was very flavorful and delicious, definitely one of my favorite pasta dishes here, but that might also be because I love me some crawfish! The salad was also really fresh and yummy. Shrimp Pommodore. Fresh shrimp, tomatoes, sweet basil, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil with a side of salad. This was pretty good, I loved the angel hair pasta with the tiny shrimps. They were delicious! The fresh basil added great flavor along with the Cajun seasonings. Pasta Valinda. Capellini pasta with chicken, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, with garlic and extra virgin olive oil with a side of salad. I wasn't as much of a fan of this dish because I found it overly sour but I think that's just because of the mainly tomato and artichoke heart flavors of the pasta. I liked it though, but I just wouldn't order just this. Also, because I felt like it was more of an Italian dish with a sprinkle of Cajun spices rather than legit Cajun food. Beignets. Fried dough dusted with powdered sugar. I was very disappointed with this dish because it wasn't that great, too much dough and too little air. And also because it was half cooked. I think Brenda's in SF has better beignets. Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle. With Grand Marnier and Raisins served with a whiskey cream sauce. Delicious as always! I love the bread pudding here, it's the perfect mix of sweet doughy goodness and cream.

The Cranberry Spin is refreshing, the Rum Punch was a little weaker than I thought it would be, but was still enough for me!We got the Palace Swan for dessert, which is worth it just for the novelty of having your dessert in the shape of a bird.Our server was lovely, energetic, and genuinely friendly.

I always get the Seafood Gumbo extra spicy they know how to hook me up...next I get the Chicken Fusilli Pasta or the Filet...damn that shit is good!! Also try the Jambaylaya Pasta and the Chicken Toupoutlas(sp) yummmmmm!! Be sure to save room for the Bread Pudding they are so sweet that usually I get one on the house...but if not I am still willing to drop some cash on it.

I have never had a bad meal or bad service there oh and be sure to order one of their signature drinks...not the martini unless you have a steel stomach but the fruity one with rum!!The muffins rock... my dog loves them...I love the raisinish one not sure of the name. Oh and what other restaurant in Santa Babara will pass out food to the local homeless guy...in such a wonderful way.

I feel like the world (and by world I mean the bubble that I live in called San Francisco) doesnt have enough Cajun restaurants. From the decor (off the wall, random tacky things pinned up on the walls) to the southern hospitality you receive as you walk in the door. This restaurant was highly impressive. Showing up here on a busy Presidents weekend Sunday night with 6 rowdy drunk girls; The Palace not only accommodated us without a reservation at prime dinner time, but they also gave us free munchies to snack on (probably bc they thought they should sober us up prior to letting us sit down in the joint) Whatever the cause, we did not have to wait long before they seated us right in the middle of one of the rooms! Free entertainment maybe?? I liked that the Palace goes with different flavored mini muffins as opposed to bread and butter. The mini muffins are deadly delicious, so watch out because there is no end to how many they bring you, so you can easily find yourself filling up on such. The gumbo ya ya is so hearty, its a def must, even if its just as a starter. All the ladies ordered different types of pastas. None of which had any complaints or qualms. Everyone of the dishes had a huge portion that could easily be turned into two meals, and All the pasta sauces were very creamy..

They have been in Santa barbara for a long time and its a testament to how great this place is. I like to go at least once a year. The New Orleans inspired menu is all delicious. Great appetizers. They also start you off with a mix of their house made mini muffins: jalapeno cornbread, rosemary, and sweet molasses. Seafood is very good and I have really enjoyed the blackened catfish, soft shell crab and their rare redfish. The steaks are amazing too, stuffed and served with ponchartrain (spelling?) sauce is phenomenal. The martinis are HUGE, delicious and strong as you get to enjoy a full mason jar for pouring at your convenience. The tropical hurricane is always a crowd pleaser with our guests. Singing ""what a wonderful world"" throughout the night is always a highlight and I look forward to it every time we go. Service is excellent. Their deserts are also fantastic, I highly recommend the bread pudding which you order early to make sure its ready in time. Can't say enough good things about this unique and incredible place.

5/16/2009,"Santa Cruz, CA","Headed down to Santa Barbara to meet up with friends, so we checked out Yelp to find a fun delicious place to eat dinner on one of the nights. Was thrilled to see all the great reviews for this place. Sorry to say, our experience was lacking. Luckily it was Sunday evening and the place only had 3 tables occupied, so we got a table immediately- good so far! Our server introduced herself, she even pointed our her photo for us in the menu- very helpful- and familiarized us with the menu as we were first (and last) timers. She told us they work as a team and we could expect to be waited on by all the staff in the place. That was the last time we were approached without having the flag someone down. Maybe they were lacking in enthusiasm having only a handful of tables, who knows- but we never had water refilled or rolls or drinks without having to ask someone to come over. Now onto the ""authentic"" food. Having been to New Orleans many times, I was thrilled at the opportunity to experience some of these eats without having to make the trip. The crawfish appetizer was nothing but doughy small and tasteless, our prawn appetizer was good, but nothing you wouldn't get anywhere else. We ordered the platters so we could sample a bunch of stuff, again lacking in flavor, really nothing special. I was really counting on the bread pudding to save the day- disappointment- like a big cinnabon you get at the airport! had to ask for the check, and we hit the road. oh well, so much for dropping $160 on an ordinary meal. the next day we opted for good old mexi- and drove to Taqueria Rincon Alteno in Capenteria, a spot we always hit on our way to so-cal - feasted on the al pastor burrito for $5 and loved it.",2 star rating,tickle p.

The food is generally really good (a few things are off but most of it is great), the drinks are strong, and it's a fun atmosphere.If I ever had people visiting me, I always suggested we go here.

Have to be honest with you I myself have never been to New Orleans but plan to go this year 2015.My most favorite music is Jazz and  Blue! My favorite listening instrument is the saxophone accompanied by a trumpet, and well still have grand illusions of proficiently playing the piano!  The vibe is there and the food is incredible!  I am love filet mignon and the way they prepare it is bar none! Pan seared in an Iron skillet.  My father a huge fan of cajun food and travelled to New Orleans several times.  The atmosphere is so authentic and you can not fall in love with it enough and the service!!!! Have to tell you when we were first referred to it the ""Palace Grill"" sounded a bit pretentious and what was so much fun was to find out it was not at all but very authentic!",5 star rating,Lisa M.

We visit Santa Barbara frequently and always return to this restaurant as its always been a fun, positive experience from the moment we walk in. The food has always been amazing but definitely didn't meet our expectations tonight and left disappointed. Their service was lacking tonight - no familiar faces tonight and it was clear the manager/owner wasn't present. We ordered a cocktail and finished it way before our dinner came and was never asked if we would like another one. Our water wasn't refilled and the topper was our table just kept piling up after each course. The dishes were just left on our table - we noticed the busser just kept walking back and forth - doing nothing. We always love the homemade muffins they serve before dinner and they were so hard tonight - must have been leftover from the weekend and warmed up. Their was just an evident lack of service, direction and management this evening.",2 star rating,Gina H.

1/27/2009,"Burbank, CA","What an amazing place. I have been to Santa Barbara several times and have never been here. We went on Saturday and of course there's a line. The 6 of us were contemplating a jump over to another restaurant when alas...the host comes out with fried chicken appetizers! Free apps while waiting in line? I'm sold. Delish! There was also a duo playing the drums and steel guitar that made our wait as pleasant as could be. Once we got in the place was very cute. Right out of New Orleans. There were boxes of Cafe Du Monde mix for beignets on the wall and I was so anxious that I asked the waitress if we could order some now...bummer, no beignets at night....BOOOO...the ONLY downfall but I get it, the place was packed! But wait!!! There's an even BETTER dessert option (see below). So I order some Pepper Spicy Martini. It wasn't too spicy and a bit too easy to drink which makes for a good cocktail. It was followed by a ""Ball"" jam jar side car. That refilled my one drink oh...about 5 times. The peppers in it were good too. We ordered some fried crawfish and baked oysters for apps...both awesome. So before dinner arrives, they play music for everyone to sing along to including the staff. Every person is toasting and having a great time! For dinner, the steak with stuffed crawfish was amazing. I had steak elsewhere the night before and was contemplating getting another one on the same weekend and I'm so happy I did. I will go back just to eat that. Finally dessert...we had to pre-order the Bread Pudding Souffle. DEVINE! Probably one of my Top 5 all time favorite desserts! Bananas Foster was also a hit. We'll be back and this place has inspired me to go back to the Big Easy!",5 star rating,Erika Q.

7/18/2012,"San Francisco, CA","Good food and generous portions make it easy to overeat here. I know I almost did and my dining companion *definitely* did. With that caveat, here's the lowdown:Service: adequate, not solicitous, though certainly not tremendously warm. Perhaps a casualty of this restaurant's popularity? Drinks: I had a lemon drop martini and my companion had the ""Dean martini."" Didn't taste the Dean, but my lemon drop was perfect. Not too sweet, as so many are, and definitely on the strong side :)Apps: crawfish popcorn, an old standby, was generously sized and  finger lickin' good. The complimentary basket of mini muffins was mowed down by my companion (see paragraph 1), but the bites I had were tasty. I think there were 6 different types of mini muffins, some savory, some sweet. Mains: Crawfish Étouffée was really large. Took 1/2 of it home for the next day's lunch. My companion had the Jambalaya, which was also really large. Both dishes were quite good. My Étouffée was surprisingly spicy, which was fine with me, as I love spicy food, but the menu description didn't lead me to expect this. Consider yourself warned :)Dessert: Bread pudding Soufflé with a delectable Whiskey Cream Sauce. Oh. Yes. I'm a sucker for bread pudding, and this was no exception. I've also had the dark chocolate Soufflé with Bourbon Cream Sauce here, and it's awesome. Chicory Coffee Au Lait was a great counter to the sweetness. We walked in without reservations, but as this place is popular (deservedly so) with larger groups, expect a convivial atmosphere and a wait if you show up in the middle of dinner hour with more than 2 people.",4 star rating,Jeanie S.

We went for an early dinner and proceeded to order a light dinner and a dessert each. Service was charming. Had a cosmo, also good. We shared the popcorn crayfish and crabcakes. Loved the former, the latter was well...a crabcake. Nothing special. Dessert appears to be their forte - the bread pudding souffle was as good as it was famous. Lovely with the addition of a whiskey cream sauce. Bananas Foster was also good (and huge!). Sweet potato pecan pie was not quite as good as the other two, but still quite yummy. Yelp has never steered me wrong before - and this wasn't ""wrong"" perse', I guess I just was prepared for an 'out of this world' experience from all the praising reviews. I would probably go back for the bread pudding, and to try something more from the dinner menu, but until then, I'm going to have to give it three stars.",3 star rating,Alex M.

5/2/2013,"Irvine, CA","Even though I no longer live in Santa Barbara whenever I visit my grandfather this is his restaurant of choice. I can't say I am complaining about that hahaThe Palace is a fun with a funky New Orleans style decor. They have seemed on the busy side the few times I have been here so I would recommend reservations.First and foremost. Order the bread pudding when you sit down. It is absolutely amazing. It does however take about a Hr to make so thats why it should be ordered up front.Between me and my family we have tried a few items, so here is the breakdown....Drinks--Hurricane Margarita-This is one of their specialty drinks. If you like tequila this is excellent. It's fruity but not overly sweet-Rum Punch-Another specialty drink. A little fruity, but tasty and strong. Similar to a mai tai.Coffee-I know this seems weird to mention, but I am a huge coffee/espresso person. Their coffee here is one of the best I have ever had. So good in fact that I bought a tin to bring home with me. It's called Cafe du Monde, and is a must tryStarters--Coconut shrimp-Awesome. The flavor of these really pop. They are served with a tasty horseradish sauce.-Crab-cakes- One of my favorite appetizer choices. The ones here are very good and made a little differently. They are served with crawfish. I have never been a huge crawfish fan, put was pleasantly surprised. Mains-Redfish-This is my dad's favorite item. He says it is excellentSalmon-You can order this grilled or blackened. I prefer grilled. It is served with an excellent jalepeno sauce, that gives it a nice little kickAhi-My favorite item. Always fresh and served with a tasty pineapple relishJambalaya Pasta-I love this pasta. It is awesome and taste like it came straight out of a New Orleans kitchen. It is a mixture of shrimp, chicken and sausage served with a spicy tomato creole sauce.Cappalina capri-This is my moms favorites, and one of my top. It is an angel hair pasta served with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke. The sauce is excellent with just a hint of garlic that adds to the flavor.Fusilla al Fumo- I love pasta with cream sauces, and this one is great. Severed with red peppers and eggplant in a tasty and flavorful tomato cram sauceBlackened filet-Personally I am not a steak person, but this item got good reviews from my family.Desserts--Bread pudding-I already mentioned this, but feel it deserves a reminder. An absolutely amazing dessert. The whiskey cream sauce is to die for.-Key lime pie-Very good.",4 star rating,Jenn P.

7/11/2007,"San Francisco, CA","eeek! I love this place! Probably one the things I miss most about Santa Barbara....I'm not even sure to begin...but I'll start with the service.  This place gets packed. On the weekends there can be a bit of a wait, as the usually don't take reservations after the 5:30 sitting, but then Erol, the manager will come out with some deep fried calamari and give it to all the people waiting in line....once you're in and being waited on, they use a ""team approach"" to serving, which basically means you can ask any one walking around to help you with whatever you need....Which brings me to the food....hmmmmmmmmmmmmm, I love it! I would always come here on my lunch breaks and get the chicken gumbo and some muffins....so good! At dinner I'd order a few different things, but my favorite would be the blackened steak, with the artichoke hollandaise sauce on top, OMG! SO GOOD!No review of the Palace would be complete either, with out mentioning the sing along. Occasionally,  (not every time) they would walk around and hand out a closed book and tell you to wait until the music came on...then they would start singing ""What a wonderful world"" and all the staff and managers would walk around with a glass of wine and cheers everyone at your table. Good times, creates a great atmosphere...and I've also see a magician  there a few times doing tricks at tables...GOOD TIMES!",5 star rating,Matthew S.

Was great.  I remember repeatedly praising the pasta.  What kind of pasta?  I don't know.  Man... I don't know.  I know it had beef.  I'm sure it had some sort of cream based sauce... but I don't know much more.The ""salads"" were my kind of salads.  Meaty and less green.  I didn't even know they were salads...I LOVEDDD the atmosphere.  We were pretty loud but was probably encouraged in this type of atmosphere.  Fun, exciting and good food around us.Somehow, with all the booze and food we ordered, it was about $65 for a couple after tax and tip.  I was shocked.  Our alcohol bill is usually close to that amount...Will definitely come back here when I'm back in Santa Barbara -- less intoxicated though.",4 star rating,Darren T.
8/30/2009,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA","My family and I took a trip up to Santa Barbara today to get away from all the smoke of the Station Fire. We decided on The Palace Grill thanks to good reviews from Yelp.It's a cozy place with cool, funky music. Not too fancy...I didn't have to worry about my 2 year old making too much noise.We started out with the flash fried artichokes for $5.50. Our twins and 2 year old weren't to keen on them but my husband and I really enjoyed them. They were served with a tangy dipping sauce.We ordered off the lunch menu and liked the reasonable prices.I got the crab cakes which were very good served with an aioli sauce, rice and vegetables. Not the best crabcakes I've ever had but still very good. $9.95My husband ordered the jambalaya pasta and he loved it. Ate everything off his plate. Also $9.95Our twins split the penne pasta pontalba which was also very good, creamy and VERY rich. They ate really well. They also liked the mini muffins served on the side. So much so I gave them mine. $8.99Next time we're up in Santa Barbara we will check out Palace Grill again. I think next time I'll try one of their po'boys!

8/12/2011,"San Jose, CA","My family and I felt discriminated against at this restaurant. Reasons for this are: the host sat us at the worst section of the restaurant when there were many, many open tables. As a server myself, I understand that ppl have to be served in certain sections, so that did not bother me much until our server came. She did NOT look happy to see us, at all. It is possible that she was having a bad day, but she was cheery and welcoming to her other tables. Also, I am sure that I heard her complaining ""if this table doesn't tip me, I am going to be..."" (we still tipped her 15% just to be nice...she deserved 0%). In addition to the horrible service, the food was not worth the price.

7/13/2009,"Brea, CA","I first saw this on yelp about two years ago, with all of its fantastic reviews.  I was dam excited to go here because guess what my favorite type of cuisine is : cajun!  I sure was disappointed.  Where is the song fest, the magic tricks, the live bands, the great foooood?? Maybe I came on an off night, but would you really consider Friday night an offnight?  Luckily we didn't have to wait very long for our table, about 15 minutes.  I'll just break down this meal in steps ...1. Excellent banana walnut bread and the raisin bread was fantastic2. Seafood gumbo.  Ingredients were there, not enough roux.  Tasted like water + salt + seafood.3. Crabcakes were a disaster.  The whole point of a crab cake is to be able to taste the crab! I tasted nothing but stuffing.  And to top it off, it tasted like a pile of mush.  If you're gonna FRY a crabcake, at least heat the oil up correctly before you dump it in...4. Shrimp Etoufee: Not bad.  I loved the smoky flavor that was in here.  Taste was there.  Too bad it was doused in oil.5. Jambalaya: Pretty good.  Not outstanding but good.  6. Bread pudding Souffle  - Pile of mush.  At least it was free because we had a bday girl.  And they were cool enough to write her name in Chocolate.Bottom line:  Decent service, very inconsistent food, a complete lack of environment, EXPENSIVE prices for mediocre food = two stars.Commander's Palace ... why did you have to close your Las Vegas location down ... =(",2 star rating,Kelvin C.
3/2/2010,"Brooklyn, NY","I had a wonderful experience here.  Doesn't hurt that I'm a Cajun food fanatic.First, the muffins come out.  And holy hell, they were good!  Best muffins I think I've ever had.  There were an assortment, but the rosemary muffins were just fanfuckingtastic.  And they were unlimited.  I deff ate waaay too much before I got my entree.  They were like drug addiction good.  For the main course, I ordered the crawfish etoufee.  It was delicious.  Many times I feel Cajun establishments make gumbo that takes like etoufee and vice versa, but here there was a very noticeable difference.  The gumbo that my buddy ordered was a bit lighter in flavor, but meatier.  The etoufee had a very rich, dark roux; with almost a smoky roasted flavor.For dessert, we ordered the bread souffle and split it amongst the four of us.  Keep in mind it takes 45 mins to make, so you have to order it when you order your entrees basically.  It was delicious.  The whiskey cream sauce was amazing.  The whiskey flavor was intense, yet it wasn't too overpowering.  I never would thought whiskey would go well in cream.The Dean Martinis were strong and plentiful.  And for some reason they had everyone sing along to ""It's a Wonderful World,"" which is loads of fun when you have a few martinis in you.My only gripe is that I felt it was a little expensive.  Cajun food is rather homey and simple; so I always feel it should be pretty dang cheap.  Overall, a great experience, a true gem in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Aloysius T.

Save room for the bread pudding. Be sure to let them know ahead of time that you want dessert because it takes 30min to make. TOTALLY worth the wait.The only thing better than the food is the staff. They are all incredibly helpful, friendly and sincere. Ask for Anne.",5 star rating,Joe S.

2/21/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","Probably my favorite restaurant in SB.  Now that we have lived here two years I have to use both hands to count the number of times we have been here and loved every meal.  The last time I came here, about a month ago, I was with a friend who hadn't been.  When we walked in they were singing the famous song by Louis Armstrong and Errol noticed me and had the hostess grab a glass of wine right away so we could participate!  My friend was speechless and I felt like a VIP!  There is a reason the Palace was voted best service 2010 by the Independent.From the homemade muffins, to the very big Cajun Martini, every entree I have tried to the bread pudding:  Man oh man this place is the best.",5 star rating,Adam S.

Only minor set back was the server does not let you split checks no matter how many people you have in your party. After a couple people had left and paid I wanted to see the remainder of the bill so I could pay it and she said she was unable to show me or give me the balance until I gave her my card. Nontheless i did, but it was just a bit different. Anywho, definitely new orleans style food, and the plates are very great portions. We all had a wonderful time",5 star rating,Samantha D.

5/3/2011,"Torrance, CA","The Palace Grill came highly recommended by my best friend.  My girlfriends and I were just here over the weekend and was not disappointed at all!  There was a line to get in at 7pm on a Saturday but was entertained by the Jug band right outside the restaurant.  One of the owners came out within 5 minutes of standing in line and took our names down and informed us of a 30 minute wait.  Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait.The gang started with the cajun crawfish popcorn  - amazing!  I had a cup of the seafood gumbo - delicious!   Tthe muffins....where do I begin!!  They served that instead of your typical bread.  They came to the table piping hot -- banana nut, apricot, jalapeno & cheddar , buttermilk. All so good!  We didn't have any drinks since were were a bit toasty from the wine tasting earlier in the day.  However, my girlfriend recommends the jalapeno martini on my next visit!  I had the pork chop and it was nice size cut.  It was tender and moist.  Although I think I would've enjoyed it more with less sauce.  It was a bit too sweet for me.  My other girlfriend had the lamb - very good, no gamey taste to it.   Trust me, i had a bite!  And the other friend had the BBQ shrimp.  The size of the shrimp was like a prawn.  Delicious!Then, after after a second basket of more muffins, we remembered we had the Bread pudding souffle coming.  Ugh, we were stuffed but that did not stop us.  We did manage to finish the souffle!  Delicious!!The atmosphere is full of energy, fun and loud.  Great place to dine with a group of friends.  It was amazing to see how quickly they turned the tables around since it is a fairly small restaurant.  I'd def go back the next time I'm in SB.",5 star rating,Jo S.

Disappointed by overall service though, as we waited for awhile and had to ask several times for drink refills. Had to call the waiter over to order additional drinks and dessert. This happened while a sign on the restaurant wall claims they pretty much have the ""best service"" ever. Umm, ok? Maybe it was an off night.Our lack of service seemed even more apparent while a couple of girls sitting at the table right next to us received prompt and excessive service. Could it be maybe because they were dressed to impress with low-cut club clothing? Our waiter announced loudly that these girls had a surprise complimentary dessert as he leaned over their table and ogled them while setting down the pie. We didn't get any complimentary dessert!

9/28/2011,"Waikoloa, HI","Dined here with some friends on 7/24/11 in celebration of my BFF's 30th birthday.  This is one of her favorite places to dine since we were students back at UC Santa Barbara.  I have to say, she picked a great place to celebrate her special day.  :)  We started off  with the cajun crawfish popcorn and the Caribbean coconut shrimp.  They were both  fantastic, super tasty and not to mention nice and crunchy!  We all finished them in minutes!!!  For dinner, I ordered their CHICKEN TCHOUPITOULAS and they also gave me a side of their Lemon Creole butter caper sauce and chopped pecans.  OMG!  Really delicious!  You can tell both sauces were rich, but so very good.  Chicken was soft and moist, not rubbery at all. My hubby ordered their soft shell crab and let everyone at our table try it.  Everyone at our table was raving about how great it was.  I am not a fan of crab, so I can't tell you how great it was.  My hubby gave it an A+.  :)My friends ordered FUSILLI WITH ROASTED SWEET ITALIAN SAUSAGE and my BFF ordered their scallops dish.  Again, both were very good!Have a sweet tooth?  Then the Palace is a place where you definitely want to order dessert.  I highly recommend their chocolate souffle that is served with chocolate bourbon cream sauce!  OMG! OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!  It's  served super warm and it is sinfully rich!  But believe me, after eating this you won't mind switching over to the dark side and being bad!  ;)    Another dessert that I would recommend is their Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle.  Again, another winner!  It is served with a rich, whiskey cream sauce.  YUM!  It is best to order your souffle with vanilla ice cream!  So good!    Last, I recommend the Palace Swan.  It is an eclair pastry baked in the shape of a swan, filled with French vanilla ice cream and is served swimming in warm chocolate!  Really delicious and beautiful presentation!  :)  TIP:  Their alcoholic beverages may not seem strong, but then they tend to sneak up on you!  I had the Palace Caribbean Rum Punch.  Oh man!  It made the room spin!",4 star rating,Amy C.

We stayed in Santa Barbara.The first night we arrived, we were starving. Where to eat in this alien land? Naturally, I yelped the area. ""OoOoOooO, Cajun..."" I said wide-eyed. Three words to describe the experience: Happy we went.Upon arrival, we walked into a full dinner crowd, but were able to be seated right away. First thing I noticed, it was loud, but there was no music. Hmmm. I wonder...Our gracious server took our order: Jambalaya Pasta for me, Pecan Chicken Picatta for him, please =)While munching on the little free muffins, our server came by and dropped off a laminated card, instructing us not to open it until the music started. Exciting... I love surprises!With anticipation building, I was soon distracted when our food arrived. It was simply the best pasta I've ever had... I could not stop eating it. I ate the entire plate until I was uncomfortably full, and I didn't even regret it. But that wasn't the best part...The music started, and we opened up the card. Everyone, began singing along...

4/2/2010,"San Diego, CA","Yelpers beware: TOURIST TRAP!!! We went here for dinner after reading the reviews. Apparently employees are required to pose as Yelpers and give the place raving reviews to attract sucka tourists like us. We ordered the crab cake for an appetizer, which turned out to be dough with a hint 'o' crab. Worst crab cake ever. We also ordered the Cajun Martini and Tropical Margarita. The Cajun was supposed to be ""marinated"" vodka in jalapeno peppers. Turned out to be cheap vodka with two peppers dunked in the glass for $10. Margarita was not worth $8.For the mains we had the crawfish etoufee and diver's scallops. The crawfish was overcooked and the sauce was relatively tasteless. The scallops were overcooked and got stuck in my wife's teeth. Both dishes came with rice that was scooped onto the plates and definitely had to be Uncle Ben's.

After a long and grueling process of having to choose from the huge, delicious-sounding, jaw dropping, mouth drooling menu I finally ordered the Creole Lamb Chops (medium-rare) and my boy ordered the Jumbalaya Sauce Piquante.SOOOOOO GOOD! So savory, juicy and tender, easy to go down with the mashed potatoes and delicious steamed veggies. If you don't like mushrooms, don't get it. But! if you do, then I highly recommend this dish. As for the jumbalaya it was pretty darn good.We topped it off with the bread pudding (which was the point at which I exploded and had to drink it down with a rootbeer, my favorite kind!), which was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.All in all, this place made me super happy :) didn't get any of the singing though, I have to admit, I was kinda disappointed!",4 star rating,Gina M.

The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, even the mashed potatoes were amazing. My husband loved his; he ate every bite. The cocktails were good. They had everyone in the restaurant sing a song in the middle of our dinner (only if you wanted to) and the waiters and staff came up to all the tables to cheers us with their drinks. It was just so fun and family oriented. I felt like family there.We happened to be celebrating our anniversary, and coincidentally the two tables next to us were as well.

This was more than enough for the two of us. The service is interesting as though you have a waiter, you can basically get anyone to help you. We started off with their signiture drink and I was not a fan. It was just not good. There is a pepper, pickled flavor that I just didn't like. They were nice enough to take it off the bill and bring us the punch instead which was really good. The crawfish was really tasty and I loved their dipping sauce. The gumbo was not as spicy as I hoped it would be but it was still good. The portion is small but it was enough to share and get a taste. We finished off with the bread pudding souffle which was fantastic! I would have this again in a heartbeat. We didn't get the muffins until we asked what everyone else was getting and they brought it right before the dessert. I liked the sweet ones better than the savory ones but it could have been that I was already ready for dessert.

6/18/2009,"Newark, CA","It's graduation weekend on a Sunday in June & The Palace Grill celebrated the occasion by producing a prix-fixe style menu ($40-$50 per person) for their patrons that night.  Not bad for the value since it included an appetizer, entree, dessert, and non-alcoholic beverage.Our party of four didn't have reservations as we walked-in and was promptly told that the evening is unavailable for the most part if you hadn't called ahead of time.  Luckily, it was 5:45pm (they open 5:30pm for dinner) and still early enough to squeeze us in.  By the time we finished around 7:30pm, about 90% of the restaurant was filled with groups and recent graduates.Love the high ceilings and decor as I pictured myself back in New Orleans French Quarter (something like a modern looking Gumbo Shop).  Waiters were friendly, dressed professionally, and attended to our group consistently through the night (filled my Arnold Palmer twice).They have an awesome cornbread selection to start with!  The jalapeno and molasses version left an impression on me the most.  The 'graduation' menu maybe different from their normal items, but here's what I thought of goodies I had tried:- Traditional Gumbo: good flavor with a little kick- Seafood Gumbo: slightly milder than the traditional but stands out on its own- Oysters Rockefeller: a hit amongst my friends, five small oysters broiled with delicious sauce- Filet Mignon stuffed with crawfish: good steak so crawfish was really unnecessary as a stuffing- Rack of Lamb: tender & juicy with no gaminess- Bread pudding: good rum flavor that complements with the white sauce- Chocolate souffle: a bit too chocolatey for me- Key lime pie: not much to write home aboutThanks to Yelp for suggesting this out-of-towner with some good Cajun cookin' in Santa Barbara of all places!Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Value: 3/5",4 star rating,King L.

Dinner started with a basket of muffins and we ordered the oysters rockfeller - oysters served with hollandaise sauce - SO good! The menu is pretty large, lots of cajun offerings of course but I managed to find a dish that wasn't spicy - the pasta royale - steak with pasta served in a worcestershire cream sauce. The serving was huge and had lots of big hunks of steak. The meat was very tender and the sauce had a good smoky sweet flavor.During the meal they had a toasting session where the staff comes around to each table and toasts you while music is playing.

1/12/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","The Palace is by far my favorite restaurant, my family has been coming here for over 13 years.11 years ago my step mother suffered a brain aneurysm, after being in icu in Los Angeles for over a month she was transferred to a head injury recovery facility in Santa Barbara.  When my dad would ask her what she wanted to eat everyday she would ask where they were.  They went on one of their first dates here and she would connect being in Santa Barbara with going to The Palace.  Having lost her short term memory she said she'd like to eat at The Palace nearly everyday for over a month.  My dad informed the staff of her head injury and everyday they pretended like it was her first time there to make her feel comfortable and not confuse her.  The people here have such a good energy and give such amazing customer service that the food being so amazing is a bonus.I definitely recommend going on a Friday night when the magician is there.  Sure the line is sometimes long, but the place isn't that big and we all should learn a little more patience.  When you're waiting in line they bring you appetizers to taste and sometimes the magician comes outside and does magic tricks.  For an appetizer I always order the Plantation Chicken Salad, comes with more chicken than lettuce .  Everything on their menu is quite amazing actually, the pasta royale has to be my favorite pasta on the menu (the portion is huge and it's even better the next day).  The filet mignon melts in your mouth and the catfish is also amazing.  As far as the pudding souffles go the chocolate one is very rich, delicious but rich.  The bread pudding one is a little less sweet, I'd say the perfect amount of sweet and is also quite amazing.   As far as drink choices go, if you can't do the spicey Cajun martini, or as one of their waiters called it their ""man drink"" (I couldn't get through one glass) their hurricane margarita is delicious and ask for it ""spicy"" they add more alcohol",5 star rating,Shanacie M.

1/7/2013,"San Jose, CA","I was visiting Santa Barbara, and I went here with my wife on a suggestion from a friend.  We were not the slightest bit disappointed in our lunch!  My wife had a chicken salad, which was quite large and came with two corn muffins.  The chicken was very flavorful, and not too spicy.  The muffins that came along with it were very good.  I had a chicken po'boy with fries, which was excellent.The staff was very friendly and on top of things.  Since it was lunch time during the middle of New Year's week, I'm not sure I got a sense of how busy the place might really get.  I would have never found this place though, had I not had a friend's suggestion, because it's off the main street.  However, if I'm ever back in Santa Barbara, I'm definitely going here for dinner!",5 star rating,Wesley H.
6/3/2010,"San Jose, CA","I came here for lunch on a Friday with my bf. We had taken a trip to New Orleans earlier this year for Mardi Gras, so eating at this Cajun restaurant was very reminiscent of our previous vacation. The decor is very cute: a fake balcony with beads hanging on it and cards stuck to the ceiling of the restaurant, to name a few items that stood out.I ordered the jambalaya with rice; he ordered the soft shelled crab po'boy. My jambalaya was pretty good -- well seasoned and quite tasty, though I don't think the texture was exactly right (but I enjoyed it anyway). I took a bite of the po'boy, which was also yummy (don't forget to add tabasco sauce!), but again, not quite like how they do it in NOLA.On a side note, we actually came back here that night for a late dessert, and ordered the dark chocolate souffle and bananas foster. The dark chocolate souffle was delicious! Not too sweet, just the way I like it. The bananas foster was great served with ice cream. I would definitely recommend this place for Cajun food in California!-L.",4 star rating,Leeann C.

It seemed a bit run down since the last time I went.  Perhaps they just put it together a bit more for dinner; not sure.  Last time we went, I would have recommended it for a romantic dinner.  Now, I would save it for a yummy lunch (Again, maybe I just need to go back for dinner...maybe things are different.  Maybe table cloths come out once the sun goes down!).For lunch, I had the Crawfish Popcorn Po'Boy, which was quite good.  A good balance of breading and crawfish.  I would definitely go back again...for lunch.",3 star rating,Jacqueline C.
2/15/2009,"Culver City, CA","I loved the atmosphere of this place.  The food was very good, too.When we walked in at 8pm, there was a little bit of a wait....not because they had no tables, though.  From what I understand, at 8pm every night they play ""what a wonderful world"" and the waitstaff clinks everyone's glasses.  So we had to stand there until the song was over...which would've been annoying if the the tradition wasn't so charming.We ordered one of the sampler plates for our meal.  Boy oh boy was that good.  My beverage was pretty strong too.  They do lose one star for the dessert.  We got the bread pudding souffle which was so highly recommended.  What a disappointment!  I love bread pudding, too.  But the flavor was just wrong on this and it was dry.  What a waste of calories!  Avoid it if you like the kind of bread pudding that is custardy and tastes good.

It reminds me of eating at BJ's or other chain resto's that have some kind of creole or cajun dish on the menu. They have good strong exotic drinks (also on the expensive side) Their crab cakes are awesomeFun spot to go with friends, especially on a night when they have music, i heard they have a magician on friday's or saturdays that does some tricks, which i heard is also the story behind the cards stuck to the ceiling, but ive been a few times and never seen him.I dont think i'll go back, there are too many other places in SB waiting for me to try.

Make friends with him :)Here's the low down on reservations: you can only make them for the first seating (at 5:30). If you want something later, you roll the dice and will probably have to stand in line for 15-20 minutes, but this is okay: there's always this pair of guys playing zydeco music out front, washboards and all.The drinks are good, the food is good, the sing alongs are fun, the service is friendly- it feels like more of a supper club rather than a place you just go grab a bite.My key lime pie was a bit of a disappointment, but I'll forgive it. The pepper martinis are ridiculous (if spicy vodka is your thing, you get a whole mason jar of it!)

2/25/2013,"Capistrano Beach, CA","My husband and I are in our mid/late thirties and grew up in the Bay Area, so we have had the opportunity to eat at a lot of nice cultural restaurants with great food.  This is not one of those restaurants. *Note: my husband and I just had our first child, 7 months.  Our trip to Santa Barbara was our first, two night stay away....so we were looking for some FUN and great food and thought we would try Palace Grill, big mistake. *We arrived at about 7:00pm on a Sun night (President's Wkend) and there was a blonde woman managing the front desk, I believe she may be the owner???  She took our names and said it would be a 40min wait.  All was fine until....*There is no bar area to wait.  The area in the front of the restaurant is very small, so people are forced to sit out on the curb to wait for a table.  Needless to say, the wait was only about 10min because almost everybody on her wait list had left.*Once we were seated we noticed the very limited bar/drink menu.   Frankly when I think of NOLAs I think of great food and a few cocktails...  If you decide to go here, I hope you are not picky....*My husband and I splurged and ordered the Shrimp Entree as an appetizer and the Filets (Grilled for me / Blackened for hubby) for dinner.   Well, I am glad we ordered the shrimp as just the appetizer, the shrimp were small and flavor, average.   My filet came out so-so, ordered medium came out med well, but the flavor was good.   My husband's on the other hand came out burnt... (not blackened) *I finished my meal, but my husband was still eating.  That is when I noticed the blonde woman (mgr/owner?) starting to hover over our table.   She came up and took my plate. Fine I was done.... Then with my husband's fork still in his hand, she started to clear his plate.  He had to take his last bite of food as she pulled the plate away...Seriously!?!*After that I was getting annoyed.  However, because we don't get many date nights, we were looking to enjoy a bit of conversation (maybe 10-15min) before we left the restaurant.   Well that was not going to happen....  The blonde (mgr/owner) showed up again and dropped the bill.   We left it alone for 5min and she literally came over and opened the bill to see if we had paid.   She was clearly trying to rush us out the door.  (Probably because she has nowhere for her guests to wait except the curb.)In summary the food is average (2 star)  restaurant experience ( 0 stars)  Overall...1 star.   I would not eat here unless you want to wait for a table on the curb have avg food and be rushed out of the restaurant before you have even finished your meals...  **Much better places to eat Opal, Bouchon and Los Agaves.",1 star rating,T H.

1/18/2009,"New York, NY","The Palace is a great establishment.  It's a very unique place with certain aspects that are distinct from other restaurants.  This place is what i call a ""din""-ner place.  For those who know what din means, kudos to you, and to everyone else...i'm just saying it's a place that is quite noisy.  So romantical conversationalists need not apply.  The wait was about 45 minutes, but they had two men playing some awesome music outside, so that made the time go relatively quick.The muffins that come with the meal are pretty good and most people will find one that they like over the others.  I am but a simple man, so i enjoyed the banana walnut the most.  Others with more far ranging taste buds, may like the buttermilk-rosemary.  Either way, it's a nice departure from the typical bread and butter.  The Oysters palace were delicious.  I don't usually like cooked oysters because they tend to get more chewy.  But these oysters were cooked to perfection.  The jalopeno buerre-blanc was exquite on top.I had the jambalaya both on rice and pasta.  It is a dish i call ""Jambalaya done two ways"".  They don't actually serve this, i just picked at my friends' plates.  But both are good, and extremely heavy.  The pasta has a nice smokey flavor which is delish, and was surprisingly lighter than the rice.  I also had some of the crab cake and the chicken t (i dont remember how to spell or say the dish).  The crab cakes were delicious, especially considering i am not a fan of crabs.  Finally, if you come here, you shoulder order the Bread pudding souffle.  Barnone, hands down the best bread pudding souffle i've ever had.  It is also the only BPS i've had.  At first glance this sugar/calorie monster seems like it would be too much and too sweet.  But it's a really great dessert that's probably not as heavy as the creams and butters used in the sauces of the main entrees.  I think it's only 7 bucks so its great for sharing, just don't get too much of the creamy whisky sauce on your date's mouth.  It'd be very inappropriate.",4 star rating,Lawrence C.

3/15/2009,"Oakland, CA","It's been more than two years since I've lived in Santa Barbara and participated in the food experience that is The Palace Grill and I STILL profusely extol and wax poetic over their food, drinks (ooooh the drinks!), and atmosphere!I've tried many, many dishes here over the course of many visits; from crawfish po'boys for lunch to the oysters (both palace and rockefeller - both recommended), the crawfish etouffee, the crabcakes, and my favorite desserts: the chocolate souffle, louisiana bread pudding, and palace swan (a real architectural crowd pleaser).It would really be a shame to pass over the seafood for a meal here. They really do know their seafood. I definitely recommend hanging out downtown after dinner, especially if you've ordered one of the mixed drinks - I particularly remember the Dean Martini because they do not skimp on their gin.The chocolate souffle is just the right amount of warm chocolatey, sweet goodness and the bread pudding's whiskey-infused sauce is so goddamn good, you'd want to just fill your tub and swim in it.

9/6/2010,"Barcelona, Spain","I also love this place.  This is one of my three favorite restaurants (d'Angelos and La Super-Rica Taqueria are the other two) in Santa Barbara.  Here the atmosphere is right for a New Orleans style restaurant.  The food is always outstanding and the bread pudding souffle is a real winner.  The drinks are well done.  Call me archaic or whatever you wish, but I'm saying that the gin martini with olives is the only civilized martini drink known to man.  The Palace has the gin martini right on the menu and it is called a Dean Martin.  It is nice and dry, I believe that they merely keep a vermouth bottle in the same building, comes ice cold and is as clear as a bell.  It is served in a martini glass with two nice green olives and comes with a pint Mason jar in reserve containing enough Dean Martin to have two more drinks.  Excellent I say!  Michelle had a cranberry spin martini, vodka based unfortunately, which also came served with a pint mason jar in reserve and is in a standard martini glass as opposed to a ridiculous ""Sex in the City"" giant Cosmo glass.The service has always been good for us with the right level of attentiveness without being intrusive.  This last visit I had blackened catfish which was prepared perfectly.  At first it does seem a shame to blacken such a fine fish, however, it is done here with the most delicate touch that doesn't over cook the flesh in the least.  Michelle had Chicken Tchoupitoulas which was wonderful.  You must always get the bread pudding soufle and you must order it with your entrees so it will be ready for you come desert time.  If you don't like bread pudding order this anyway it's nothing like any bread pudding you've ever had.  Get a cafe' au liat to go with the bread pudding too.  If you close your eyes you'll almost think you are at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.",5 star rating,Kevin F.
9/7/2010,"Roseville, CA","The Palace is an amazing place. I can see why the reviews always mention their service. They do their best to accommodate everyone (For the people waiting in line more than an hour, they provided them with Cajun Crawfish Popcorn [that was really nice]).We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday and already there was an hour long wait, but that didn't deter us from leaving and finding someplace else. Besides, we were the first in line and the music by Stiff Pickle was great.Now about their service. You would think that waiting an hour in line would mean waiting another hour to get our food; however, that was not the case. We literally waited less than 15 minutes for our food. YES, less than 15 minutes. Probably, even less. We were pretty impressed.  Prior to our main course, they served us mini muffins (4 kinds of flavors), which were warm and delicious. Our drinks remained full and our food was mouth-watering. I ordered the Creole Crawfish Crabcakes topped with their jalapeno beurre-blanc sauce and my fiance ordered the Jambalaya with rice. It's really hard to describe how delicious it was. The New Orleans flavor was pouring out from each dish. There was no leftovers and we tried so hard to make room for dessert, but we had to pass. That's definitely a reason to come back for more.",5 star rating,Lena N.
2/28/2011,"Goleta, CA","After trying a few more items on their menu, I felt that I needed to update my previous review. Here goes!Food: 4Drinks: 4Atmosphere: 5Service: 5Aside from the Porkchop, I really also enjoy the Lamb chops, as well as the Fillet Mignon. All of these are great options. On my latest visit I had the lamb chops which were rich and flavorful and cooked to perfection - a perfect medium rare. Portions are plentiful and I always have leftovers. More importantly though, I can't stress enough how great their service is. On my latest visit, my friend ordered the porkchop and it was dry so we, unfortunately, had to send it back. Our server was so nice about it and got us a new one immediately without hesitation. I hate having to send food back and it just reaffirms why I coming here - they really care about their guests and it shows.",5 star rating,Gina N.
3/29/2011,"MI, MI","I wish I could give this a 3.5 star review. This place has excellent atmosphere, no doubt, but the food was a bit lacking for me. I came here with Francesca L. a while back (yes, yes. It took me a while to write this review) and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. We shared their sampler platter for two and were actually able to put nearly everything away. The coconut shrimp was the stand out offering. The NY steak was also good. As F said in her review, the sauce didn't do much, though it had a pleasant consistency. All in all, the food was missing that kick you'd expect of Cajun food from New Orleans.What made the evening was the wait staff coming around and clinking glasses with us cheerily, and the group sing-a-long to Louis Armstrong.

The atmosphere is fun but the food is just okay....The best part of the meal was the non-sweet jalapeno cornbread muffin in the basket. It's rare to find cornbread that is unsweetened and this one was delicious!Jambalaya was soooo salty, it was almost inedible (we had to ask for extra rice to mellow it out).We also tried the bread pudding at the end which I was not impressed with.

PLUS live entertainment which included a band and a magician and everyone was dressed up. It was one big party with excellent food and extraordinary service.

10/24/2012,"San Francisco, CA","No.Admittedly, I am very picky about my Cajun/Creole cooking. My family hails from Louisiana, where they know how it is done. And my mother still makes the best gumbo and jambalaya I have ever had...lucky me! Still, I have been to several restaurants of this theme that have satisfied me...this simply was not one of them.First of all, what was with the abundance of pasta on the menu? There was so much of it, I thought it must be their special take on things and I should try it, so I did. How this pasta, called ""Jambalaya Pasta"" or something like that, was remotely like jambalaya and not unlike any regular ol' pasta dish at a place like The Spaghetti Factory, I have no idea. Second of all, one of our maple muffins (complimentary before the meal) was hard as a hockey puck. No, really, that's what we did with it...it was a fun game at the table. Third of all, our waitress was terrible...a grumpy older lady who seemed annoyed from the minute our group of women sat down...and could not get things quite right, from my botched drink order to her hasty removal or setting down of dishes. Imperfection is fine, but there was never any apology...just little, unnecessary side comments implying things were our fault, not hers.The best parts of the meal were the drinks (large, pretty strong pours) and the dessert (bread pudding souffle had to be ordered at the start of our meal because it is a 40-minute preparation).Downer.",2 star rating,Kiesha R.

2/10/2014,"Costa Mesa, CA","I was taken here by my bf and I have to admit the name ""The Palace Grill"" didn't really interest me. However, this place was nothing like I expected!We showed up around 7 on a Saturday and there were street musicians playing some fun music outside the door...where there was a line to get in! Because it was just two of us we only waited about 4-5 min before we were seated but it was an entertaining 5 minutes. Once sat we were given a basket of a variety of muffins. Some were harder than others but that also has to do with the ingredients. Everything from molasses to jalapeno muffins. It was fun to try them all!We tried the jalapeno martini and it was actually pretty good. I liked the bit of spice I felt on my lips after a nice sip. It comes still in the mason jar shaker with a strainer so you can pour it out as the night progresses (although, it will be watered down by the end). Since we couldn't figure out what to get off the big menu we tried the ""All the Best Platter"" and it had a wonderful variety of seafood. I loved the Crawfish étouffée as well as the coconut shrimp and soft shelled crab. They say it is good for two persons but really it would have been perfect for 3. That would have made it more reasonably priced, too, at 75/platter. I wasn't a fan of the salmon but my bf really enjoyed it. The night ended with a sing-along and bread pudding soufflé (a little tougher on the outside edges than most soufflé) with a whisky cream anglaise and it was actually very good. It had a wonderful cinnamon flavor. The whole staff was very nice and personable, which always makes any experience better! Inside was also such a ""fun"" New Orleans-style atmosphere.",5 star rating,Alison W.

Strong martini with a strong chili jalepano flavor - it was very good - one of those drinks that you sip throughout dinner.  Luckily we got their margarita as well and it was delicious!  Their drinks were very decently priced and strong - just the way I like them.  The cajun poppers are delicious!  And their assortment of bread and muffins (there was like 6 different kinds!) that come with it were also very yummy.  Their crawfish etouffee was great!  And you must end the night off with their souffle - it was delicious!  Everything, from the staff to the food and drinks - was great - I would definitely come back!",5 star rating,Theresa V.

7/28/2009,"Berkeley, CA","Ugh... I just got back from a dissatisfying meal at The Palace. I'm so frustrated by the service, food and overall atmosphere that I'm taking a moment out of ""date night"" to review this restaurant. Reasons why I'm giving this restaurant a 2 star rating:1. Extremely overpriced food. I glanced at the lunch menu and the same dish I was going to order for dinner was $10 less at lunch. 2. They got my boyfriend's order wrong twice. Yes, that meant that they brought me my entree and took 20 minutes to bring him the correct food. This left me awkwardly sitting there with my  food while they stumbled around trying to correct their mistakes. So when he finally got his food my pasta was cold. Yuck! Plus they don't have designated waiters/waitresses at The Palace, it's kind of a communal hodgepodge of service, so everyone was confused, busy and unapologetic. 3. The atmosphere was kind of depressing. Many of the people in this restaurant seemed upset and bothered by the service. They also do this sing-a-long number which might have been fun if people were drunk and/or if our food had arrived on time, but alas, it was just extremely awkward. Reasons why I'm not giving this place a 1 star rating: 1. The muffins are pretty amazing.... and free. 2. The dark chocolate souffle might be the only reason I'll ever go back.",2 star rating,Olivia H.
7/7/2010,"San Francisco, CA","This place is incredibly popular and tricky to get into without a reservation. That said, I wasn't totally impressed with the food. I LOVED the muffins that were brought to the table when we first sat down and the drinks were pretty solid (I had a take on a margarita that was pretty good). But the seafood jambalaya just wasn't very good which was a disappointment given that this is a Cajun restaurant. Several people at the table ordered the filet mignon which was pretty tasty (albeit somewhat overcooked). But the highlight was when the staff came out together, signing, with filled glasses in hand and toasted every table in the restaurant. That was fun!Desserts were far and away the standout course. I ordered the key lime pie which was very good, and the souffle was a hit as well.

9/14/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","There are plenty of reasons to come to this place but if there has to be only one then it's the Cajun Martinis.  Get them in a large glass jar, share with your friends and be sure to a chunk out of the peppers in your glass - it helps get the juices flowing.This is a great place to bring a group or have a birthday party.  On one occasion we spontaneously decided it was our friends 30th birthday (she was 25 at the time), they brought out a small cake, a plate that said happy birthday on it and she got a lot of compliments for looking younger than her age that night.  The staff is very friendly.They do not take reservations and the wait can get long but sometimes there's are musicians or magicians to keep people entertained.  If magicians are there then you can ask for the trick that ends up with your dollar bill stuck tot he ceiling.  And there's singing involved twice on weekends...so yea, be prepared to sing That's Amore when the time comes.  And have a full glass of wine, or better yet Cajun Martinis, as the waiters will be around to cheers you.That's about it.  The Palace is more or less an establishment in Santa Barbara and one the must-see restaurants in town.",4 star rating,Blaine E.
10/27/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Here's my experience from 10/27/10:The muffins were an interesting twist. They would have been much better if we didn't have to ask for them and the waiters would have brought them out knowingly. It was a very interesting assortment. The jalepenos cornbread muffins were my favorite, along with the apricot and the rosemary muffins. The other ones aren't worth mentioning. :-(Overall , it was sub-par. I went here with a friend because we were in Santa Barbara and we wanted some yummy food, and we saw the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we figured, why not. Unfortunately, I've had better Crawfish Etouffee from Popeyes than I did from the Palace Grill so I was disappointed. If you're ever in Los Angeles, you should definitely go to Harold and Belles. It puts The Palace Grill to shame. On the contrary, my friend had the Blackened Organic Catfish, which he loved. I thought it was good, better than my Etouffee, which is why I am still considering giving them the 3 Stars. But don't listen to me. Try it for yourself. You may find something on the menu which satiates your taste-buds. ;-)",3 star rating,Raven F.
12/5/2010,"San Diego, CA","As first time visitors I will definitely be returning anytime I'm in Santa Barbara! The atmosphere is loud and friendly. The service was great - we didn't have to wait for anything. Everything was excellent starting with the famous Cajun martini. Strong and tasty - they won't even let you have more than one. As for apps the Cesar salad was good, not traditional dressing (no anchovy although I like anchovies). The crab cake was delicious - large pieces of crab, the sauce served over the crab cake was scrumptious. Ordered the 'All The Best' Platter and it really doesn't get any better! Shared with my GF and could probably share it with three. The Étouffée was very flavorful, the blackened salmon was tasty (not my favorite on the platter, but my GF really liked it). The soft-shell crab was fantastic and the item I liked the best was the cocnut shrimp - just thinking back to it I'm wishing I'd eaten more while there. But there is barely room for dessert by the time you finish the platter and they show up with the bread pudding soufflé. Now for those of you who can't read or simply ignore words understand this is a SOUFFLE. But even though it's not a tradition bread pudding it's nothing to scoff at. My only complaint here is that the whiskey sauce tastes like it has whiskey in it. Next time I want to try the sweet potato pecan pie, and believe me there will be a next time!!",5 star rating,P F.

After much deliberation, my fiancee and I decided to risk waiting in line. We went on a Saturday night around 8:30pm and the line wasn't as long as we thought it would be- we waited for only 20 minutes! YAAAY!Everything on the menu looked sooo good! We kept changing our minds, but in the end, decided to dip our feet with the Palace Sampler Platter. The sampler included Chicken Tchoupitoulas, Caribbean Coconut Shrimp, Blackened New York Steak, Blackened Catfish, and for dessert, Bread Pudding Souffle.Now one of my least favorite of all time is coconut. I can't stand the texture nor the taste. But the Caribbean Coconut Shrimp was so so good! I think the reason why I liked the coconut shrimp here was because the outer layer was fried, so I hardly tasted the coconut. And the fried part offset the weird texture that I usually dislike. I also reeeeally liked the Bread Pudding Souffle. It was so creamy and just the right dessert to finish the fabulous meal. However, I'm sad to say that we didn't finish it- or should I say, we COULDN'T finish it because we were sooo full from the sampler!

We ordered the BBQ shrimp, Crawfish Etouffee, and the Capellini Capri with shrimp. The BBQ shrimp was good, huge tender shrimp with rice and veggies. The pasta was delicious, not super oily, very flavorful. The artichokes were a nice touch. The crawfish was amazing, chopped up pieces cooked with green peppers and shirmp stock. Came on top of rice. It was a little spicy, loaded with flavor, and very filling. While we were waiting, they passed out a songbook to everyone, then music came on to What a Wonderful World. All the employees walked around with a glass, toasting the patrons. It was a nice touch, especially since everyone was jolly for Christmas Eve.

They also serve a very yummy bourbon cream sauce on the side. It was a Saturday night and we had a group of 14 girls for our friend's Bachelorette Party. They were very accommodating and the service was amazing the entire time. The popcorn crawfish appetizer is very tasty and so is the aioli dipping sauce it comes with. Their signature drinks are very creative and are served in mason jars...my favorite way to drink them! During our dinner, they passed out lyrics to Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" and we had a sing-a-long with the entire restaurant, servers and cooks! All the servers and managers came by to the tables to cheers the guests with wine glasses. I then realized why the service was so friendly...it's because they get to drink while they are working! I definitely did not have a problem with that...whatever keeps the servers happy works for me! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Southern style comfort food and wants to have a memorable dining experience with some entertainment too. Thank you Palace Grill for creating a fun night for my friends and my very lucky friend who is getting married!",4 star rating,Brooke G.

The Palace Grill is great restaurant with amazing food.  It was recommended by our friend and fellow Yelper john n. The ambiance is great but a little crowded inside. You definitely need a reservation or you may end up waiting 40 minutes for a table. They close every day to get ready for dinner so if you get there right when it open at 5;00pm then you be able to sneak in without a reservation.,5 star rating,Fonzy C.

However, it wasn't super spicy like jambalaya... which is good. I'm not a fan of super spicy, I actually want to taste the food.The food is wonderful. The waiters/ waitresses are very friendly.

My boyfriends brother was in town and we were looking to go some where special so we choose The Palace Grill. Wanting to avoid a long wait I made reservations and although we arrived early we were seated imediately. The service was great. Never had our water empty or had to ask for anything additional. The server was helpful in explaining and informing us that just about anything can be made more or less spicy. The drinks we were made were strong and delish. My boyfriend always complains how his whiskey and sevens are too watered down but this place made them worth the $6, heck more!Had the gumbo, popcorn crawfish and jamblaya. All delish and made excellent leftovers. All in all very good. Only complaint is the prices but you get what you pay for. I'm just cheep! Lots more available during lunch hours and for way less!",5 star rating,Krystal V.

12/29/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is busy! we stopped by on a Tuesday night without any reservation and luckily we walked in right when they opened and was able to grab one of the remain free table. by 5:45, all most all the tables are filled already, so make sure you make a reservation if you plan to go to this place. Now the food, some are good and some are ok. We ordered the popcorn crawfish and the sample platter. To me, the popcorn crawfish has a lot of batter so I really didn't taste the crawfish much , the dip however was pretty good. Next came the sample platter, for the price I say don't order it, just get something else on the menu. The major portion of the platter consist of grilled Vegetation and rice (which actually both were pretty tasty). Also on the platter was the coconut shrimp, which is good. The blacken cat fish - delicious, and the filet mignon (could use some seasoning) and chicken which was a little dry.  The sample platter also comes with a Louisiana Bread Pudding Suffle... by the time this came out we both were stuffed so we took a few bite of this and got it to go. I think the Suffle was the highlite of the whole meal, it's remind me of cinnamon buns but with a consistency of moist bread with their sweet whiskey sauce poured over it. it was amazing!",3 star rating,Alan L.

I had the seafood gumbo which was spicy but not really hot and had a good amount of seafood.  Very flavorful.  My wife had the softshell crab sandwich which was really crispy and flavorful.  We had the bread pudding souffle which was quite good.  It was a real combination of souffle and bread pudding. The muffins they give you for the table were really good too.,4 star rating,MJ W.
1/11/2013,"San Leandro, CA","Overall 3.5 stars. This restaurant has a nice, friendly atmosphere.My friends and I ordered the ""All the Best"" Platter and jambalaya sauce piquante. The platter was filled with a lot of good food as the name implies. My favorite was surprisingly the blackened salmon because it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The coconut shrimp was nicely fried and the coconut stood out, and all paired well with the pineapple? (sweet and sour) sauce. The jambalaya was okay. The chicken was overcooked, and I didn't like the type of rice in the dish. Last but not least, the bread pudding was moist and chocolaty (but the white creamy sauce didn't taste good).",3 star rating,Cindy H.

I suppose the lines down the street to get in have passed. They now take reservations! But really nothing else has changed: The same decorations, the same menu items, even the same broad cut veggies.I suppose that their concept, generous portions of excellent cajun seafood, need not be improved. You pay some money to eat here but it really shows up on the plate.It will always be one of my favorite places. Ronald Reagan would send his goons to The Palace for take out when ever Ronnie was on holiday in the SB Country.

Try the crabcakes and the jambalaya, both are very good. Not overly impressed with the filet - didn't really seem like a true filet mignon- probably better to order this at a steakhouse. Good wine and specialty drink selection- if you feel like splurging, try the Neyers Chardonnay, it's expensive but very good. Try to make reservations if possible, they fill up quickly.",4 star rating,V A.

I recommend the Gumbo Ya Ya and the CHICKEN TCHOUPITOULAS.And there is a special treat on the hour that I won't spoil for you. Suffice it to say, it sums the entire dining experience up into a love of living. I think the best experiences in life are the ones that remind you why you're glad to be alive.

3/26/2015,"Milwaukee, WI","The food is pretty alright for southern California, but the atmosphere bothers me most. They have multiple large photos of black people in the wall (which is fine) but have ""plantation"" fried chicken salad on the menu. Beyond the name being blatantly racists and ignorant, its a huge deterrent. As a black woman I felt offended in this establishment and i am surprised that no one had yet to have the good sense to change the name. When I asked about it, the hostess ignored my inquiry. I figured she wanted to avoid a potentially uncomfortable conversation, but she was just rude and added insult to injury. I won't be back !",2 star rating,Katherine M.

3/8/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","After reading some of the less positive reviews, I have to throw in just a couple cents here.  The one thing I have had to come to terms with as far as Santa Barbarian food goes (and believe me I put up the fight of all fights), if you're looking for something authentically exotic -- you won't find it here!  I am from the south, I have eaten my merry little way through New Orleans, and no, this is not authentic Cajun food.  How can you really fault the place for not teleporting it's dishes straight from Bourbon Street though?  Ya betta go up da road to ya Uncle Earl's fa dat!With that said, this is a pretty tasty place.  Just like any other restaurant, there are hits and misses.  The servers are courteous and place an emphasis on teamwork. I always look forward to getting the complimentary basket of assorted muffins.  Let me tell you, these are so damn good you're likely to stuff your face then wonder how all the muffins disappeared so quickly!  Everything looks and tastes fresh.  I've had the diver's scallops which were delicious.  The popcorn shrimp, stuffed blackened filet, and crawfish etouffee were also tasty.  I am not fond of the lamb chops.  The sauce has a strange tang to it that makes my face do funny things.  It's refreshing to see that the portion sizes aren't overwhelming but enough to still leave you feeling pants-popping full.  The chocolate souffle is decadent and rich.  The bread pudding doesn't get my seal of approval but there are plenty who love it.  Decide ahead of time whether or not you want dessert as it takes 30-45 minutes to prepare them.Sing along time is fun and it may be the servers' favorite part of the job as they walk around the restaurant and cheers everyone while singing It's a Wonderful World with their glass of wine in hand.  This wouldn't be my go-to dinner spot but is great for a date or when you're craving something just a little different.  It's a cozy environment and is definitely worth checking out.",4 star rating,Nakry K.

The reviews were true it was delicious and I couldn't even finish the rice that came with it because I was so full. Everyone in our group ordered different things and were not let down.  When it came dessert time they brought out complementary dessert ice cream for the birthday girl with her name written in chocolate sauce!

They are famous for their bread pudding, and there is a reason, it is the BEST! I highly recommend the sampler entree for two, it is a great amount of food or a reasonable price, and you get a little bit of everything.

4/24/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","So here is the thing. This is my favorite restaurant. And this is the story - Labor day 1991 my then girlfriend and I drove up to Moro Bay in central California. The weather was glorious, driving up the PCH then onto the 101 through Santa Barbara, the wine country and San Luis Obispo. We got of the freeway heading to Moro Bay. All of a sudden the sun disappeared we were swallowed  up by what only could be described as monster fog. As we drove up to the bed and breakfast we have booked for our stay which was supposed to me yards from the water, only the the Pacific Ocean was no where to be seen. We could hear it, yes yard away just not see it. As this was before the cell phone age, I headed strait to a pay phone and cancelled out reservation. Hey lets head back to Santa Barbara and stay there for the weekend. The problem was that not a single room was available in the Mission town. From the cheapest Motel 6 to the most expansive suite. By the end of our search we did not care what room, how much it cost, we just wanted to have a place to stay. It was not to be. Tired, dirty and starving we changed our clothes in the parking lot just of State street and past Cota . It just so happened we came out from the lot onto Cota in front of The Palace Grill. There was a line in front but we got lucky and got in pretty quickly. As I made this story to long already, the food, the drinks, the staff, the ambiance, the music, the bathrooms - every single things was simply the best. Recommendations - everything. We have been driving from L.A. to Santa Barbara now just to eat there for 21 years, several time a year. We celebrated our10th anniversary there. We have taken scores of friends and family and recommended it to scores more. Alway with the same result. They all love it.",5 star rating,Victor K.

I'll stop just shy of saying the food is great because I was a bit sad over the jambalaya - it was really mild, and had very little sausage flavor. It lacked the umami one looks for in good jambalaya.  The hourly singing was fun, but I think it would get old on subsequent visits.

12/30/2009,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Palace is my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara... hands down. I've been here countless times and still love it. They stole my heart the first time I walked in for dinner. My date and I were poring over their menu when over the stereo they started playing Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World. The whole restaurant started singing in chorus while the manager came up to my date and I, handed us two glasses of wine, and we toasted. I looked at my date and she said we have to eat here. Although that girl is long gone the Palace is still with me. Over the past five years I've frequented that place about once a month and I'm still in love. The Palace year after year wins the Reader's Polls for Best Service in Santa Barbara so my story comes as no surprise. Nonetheless there is more to the Paace than the lively atmosphere. The food is pretty good. The stuffed filet mignon is a must. For something lighter the diver's scallops are quite good. Although the experience is not as lively, lunch is a great option. The Pasta Lafitte is excellent but is a tad on the oily side. Anything with crawfish is pretty good sans the Poor Boy (this simply needs a good sauce, its too plain). The crawfish etouffee is great as well as the Jambalaya. This is all at a pretty reasonable price.I probably should end this review here but there are still two things to note, The Dean Martini and the Bread Pudding Souffle. The former is served in a Mason Jar, which will easily send you flying two sheets to the wind. The latter is one of the best desserts I've had in Santa Barbara. Beware though that most newcomers typically want to get the chocolate Souffle when they see it, but in my experience the Bread pudding Souffle is the way to go. There's nothing wrong with the Chocolate the Bread Pudding is just better. The main drawback is that there is often a line out the door on a friday and saturday night, but usually there are some musicians or a magician outside to entertain while you wait.",5 star rating,Ron B.
12/2/2010,"Hershey, PA","3 stars.  Lunch menu.  Waiting on dessert - bread pudding.  The bread pudding was far below average.   In fact, how can bread pudding come out so differently.  I make it from an old Commander's Palace recipe and as I ate it - I felt befuddled, stupefied, aghast at how bread pudding could come out lacking life, taste, and anything delicious.  The sauce was not blended correctly too much bourbon or a lower quality product leave as acidity taste in cooking - esp when it isn't burnt off.   Well salad dressing on dessert my friends is what we have.  Upgrade to a top and sweeter whiskey may do the trick.   Its well located, but if you're going to take on New Orleans style cooking - the bar is pretty damn high so - it's way the cookie crumbles.  I sat at a dirty table for 20 mins waiting for dessert.  The owner came up, nice, but didn't notice.  I was already turned off by then to even bother.",3 star rating,Michael R.

I love them all - the molasses, the cheddar jalapeno, the rosemary butter ones, etc.The crawfish poppers and oysters palace are to die for! The crawfish pasta laffite is just so good.

Service was excellent since you could ask anyone to help you being that they all worked together.Now on with the food. I personally thought it was ok. Food was good but it wasnt all that! I've been to NOLA and this place is average to what I have tasted. Perhaps its the best around the area but not it you have tried food in NOLA. Everything was good it just wasnt excellent! Now as for the bread pudding I've tasted better. Commander's Palace in NOLA is by far the best! Hands down!Would I come back, sure.

8/4/2013,"Beverly Hills, CA","Can't think of one negative thing about our visit there.....Went there for lunch on the Saturday of Old Spanish Days Festival. Got in without a problem as apparently they've just started serving lunch. The greeting was nice and the service overall was very good...professional and polite and friendly.  They look sharp in their white jackets.We started with a rum punch and the hurricane martini...served in pint sized mason jars which is a fun twist. Lots of flavor, and packed a good punch.For an app we had the battered and flash fried artichoke hearts...delicious and not greasy at all, served with a nice dipping sauce.  Very good...wanted another order of them.For lunch I had the bronzed chicken Po'boy served on a perfect French roll, crispy and chewy, pickles, shredded cabbage, and a nice light mayo.  It too...delicious.  Came with a side of nice roasted potatoes with a bit of Cajun or old bay seasoning.My girlfriend had the vegetarian mardi gras pasta primavera...which she loved...a little creamier than what she typically likes, but she loved it.  Came with two mini muffins: jalapeno corn and a walnut.We were checked on a few times to see how we were doing which is always nice.For dessert...beignets...we probably didn't need them but we polished them off. A huge dusting of powdered sugar topped our order of 3. They were a little denser than I recall in New Orleans, but they sure were tasty.We will certainly recommend Palace Grill and would certainly go back again.It was a peaceful oasis on an insane day of crowded festival sidewalks....and we were able to walk it all off during the rest of the day.Kudos to the chef...and the servers.",4 star rating,Don B.

4/10/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","I went here for lunch today after hearing that it was a pretty good place, and reading all of the other reviews that (for the most part) said it was a great place. I really wanted to like this place, and for the most part, I did. I'll start with the good and end with the bad.I got an ahi tuna salad which was pretty bomb, and the person I was with got the jambalaya pasta (also pretty good). We both got the cornbread muffins and banana muffins, which were so tasty! If you ask for more, they will give you more, too... trust me, you'll want to. Also tried the bread pudding, which was perfect... not too sweet at all. You HAVE to get this if you go there... passing it up would be a crime.The food isn't what made me give the palace 3 stars-  it's the service. Im pretty sure we were just there at an off time, or our server was just having a bad day, but she barely said a word to us. She looked really annoyed that we were there, and seemed to avoid us to go talk to another table the whole time. I would go back and give this place another shot for sure. It was just kind of annoying seeing all of the other tables interact really well with their servers and have ours be inattentive and rude.",3 star rating,Alyssa S.

I had tuna, my wife and son had jambalaya, and we shared a scallop appetizer, all cooked perfectly  and tasted kingly. The key lime pie was phenomenal speaking as someone  who has had a passion for key lime since the early 70s.

The food was good, but their service and the ambiance made it even more so. Highly recommend coming on a Monday - no need to make reservations. There was no line (I just read about the appetizers), and it's not as crowded. I'm sure that would have made the singing more fun, but hey - it's still fun.

We practically had to flag down our server and ended up asking the other server and hostess for help. A few times the hostess came over to help because our server kept walking by to help other tables. The restaurant was full but no more than usual. It was so disappointing.

Some really good cards tricks serve as a great way to pass the time while you wait in line. And then, once you get inside, you notice all these cards tacked to the ceiling. You get waited on by, not just one, but a handful of the waitstaff which is pretty entertaining considering they all seem to be in a pretty good mood. Their jambalaya is fantastic as is the variety of complimentary cornbread muffins they bring for you. Top it all off with the whiskey bread pudding desert and the only thing you'll want to do is let the jazz carry you home.",5 star rating,Michael E.
3/31/2010,"Richmond, VA","OOOoo I remember the first time going here and savoring every last piece of that scrumptious warm bread pudding!This time we went for Charles L.'s birthday, because some cajun spice would light up some birthday fire! Anyway, usually this place is full and hoppin, with its kitschy magicians going around with their card tricks (look at the ceiling for all the old cards), but not this time which was a little disappointing. Back in the day, this place used to amaze me with its character, and this time it amazed my taste buds.Ordered: Popcorn Crawfish, Soft-shell crab, and the Bread Pudding!-Popcorn Crawfish- Tasty to snack on, but who can say no to fried and battered crawfish! And they don't joke around with crawfish, none of that ""oh its actually shrimp,"" this looks straight from the Bayou. Douse it in a little Tabasco and pop it in!-Soft-shell crab- This was my first time with soft shell crab, and DAMN does it feel weird eating the whole crab but god does it taste good. The sides are a little generic and lack much flavor, as I felt the rice could have been seasoned better considering its Cajun food.-Bread Pudding with Whiskey Cream- You have to order at the beginning of your meal, but its sooo worth the wait. I was full from all the other food, but I ALWAYS have space for bread pudding from here! The cream adds that warmth that only whiskey provides into a soft bread pudding that you can finish so fast you'll forget that it was a MASSIVE dessert! Trust me, I'm not one to eat a lot, but this bread pudding is something your body will WANT to stuff inside!Additionally, the muffins are a tasty side, and I'm glad they don't charge you for eating each one like they used to! So try them all!The service is adequate, nothing spectacular, though expect delays on busy days!Overall, this is probably one of my favorite places to eat when coming home to Santa Barbara. So try something outside the typical mexican or italian of SB, go Cajun!",4 star rating,Nehal N.

My girlfriend had some jambalaya pasta which she was able to finish. Not much of a jambalaya fan but it tasted good also.

4/12/2012,"CA, CA","If you like cajun or creole, you will love this place! We discovered this place long ago when we depended on our Auto Club guide for recommendations and it has maintained its excellence over all these years and we never pass up a chance to eat here.On this particular visit, we ordered the beans and rice appetizer dish to start our meal. Wow! After the appetizer, I wished I had ordered the meal size. This was just plain great! In New Orleans, it is almost a legal requirement to eat beans on Mondays and the best way to show that you are a tourist there is by failing to order them with your meal. The beans served here are the best New Orleans style beans I have had since I was in New Orleans about 15 years ago. Terrific!After the beans, my main course arrived and I loved it, too. I had the soft-shell crab po'boy and loved it. Plenty of crab and just enough seasoning to help me enjoy both the crab and the wonderful sauce.My wife had the crab and asparagus salad served in a portion large enough to require some to be left behind. The crab was mounded high on the bed of lettuce and other greens and the asparagus was also plentiful.The only drawback to having ordered the appetizer was that we had no room left to order one of the many New Orleans style desserts which are the real specialty of this restaurant. In the past, I have had the chocolate swan and the bingets and can remember them even now, years later. Until I discovered this little Jamaican place in Redlands, a town near my home, the bingets here at The Palace were the best I've ever had outside of New Orleans, but it is not so bad to be second best.",5 star rating,Paul L.

1/2/2010,"Garden Grove, CA","boooo...i was disappointed. After reading such great reviews I really wanted to come here for some good Cajun food! My Bf and I tried their sampler platter for two. It came with coconut shrimp, soft shelled crab, their special craw fish dish, salmon (i think), potatoes, veggies, rice, two sauces, and bread pudding The only thing i liked was the BREAD PUDDING!! in other words, that bread pudding cost me $75 bucks, because that's how much the sampler was. However, I do have to say, the ambiance and the vibe of the palace grill was very fun and entertaining. There was a magician who stopped by some tables to show them a few tricks as they waited for their food.

3/14/2010,"Santa Clara, CA","I was very disappointed with my recent experience here. I had dined here years ago and loved it, so when I was in town, I really wanted to eat here again.We got in line at 6:30 on  Saturday night, and were seated within 30 minutes. We were promptly served water and right after ordering, received delicious homemade muffins. The disappointing part was the food. Cajun Crawfish Tails ($12.95) were heavily battered. Many pieces were batter only; the rest was mostly batter with a tiny piece of crawfish inside. However, the sauce was good. House Specialty Stuffed Filet Mignon ($29.95) was not impressive. The filet itself, which we ordered grilled medium rare, was fine, but the stuffing, described as a ""delectable mix of fresh smoked crawfish tails"" was really an unidentifiable mush. Blackened Fresh Louisiana Redfish ($27.95) was decent. The fish itself was fresh. The saltiness and heavy spices detracted from the delicate quality of the fish. Both entrees were served with potatoes and grilled veggies, and everything was drenched with butter. We decided to pass on dessert. We were sitting in front of the dessert kitchen, and the desserts really looked delicious, but after tasting the food, we decided not to spend any more money at this restaurant. For the price and popularity of this restaurant, I really expected better quality. Service was uneven, but not bad. I would have a much better meal for the same price elsewhere.",2 star rating,Angeleen T.

6/1/2010,"Pleasanton, CA","This is my and my fiancee's favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant. The food, from the muffins you get when you sit down, to the dinner entrees, to the bread pudding dessert (both reg and chocolate) are absolutely delicious. The service is also really good, too, and there's a fun atmosphere to the place. They also occasionally have extras: sometimes they have a real band playing for the people waiting outside, and one time they hired a magician to mingle amongst the tables. The food tends to be a bit on the heavy side, and what doesn't seem like a big plate can end up really filling you up, especially since you really do need to try each flavor of muffin to appreciate them all. My favorite dish is the blackened catfish, since it's on the lighter side (gotta save room for dessert!) and is still incredibly tasty.

The crawfish/crab cake was devoid of all crab and crawfish--and it was covered with glue-like white sauce.  When the server took most of it away, not a word as to what was wrong. They use the ""team"" approach here. This means that a server we hadn't seen before came to our table three times with entrees other tables had ordered. Server had no clue. Talk about cluster-f#ck. Oysters Palace was pure yuck. Gumbo was okay. Spend your money at a place where they craft dishes with skill and care using excellent ingredients. And ""blackened"" is simply burnt.

7/24/2011,"New Orleans, LA","This place was not great. I'm from New Orleans and the food wasn't anything like what we eat. The etouffee had what we call ""Chinese crawfish"" (little bitty pre frozen ones) and the bell peppers and onions were chopped too large..... also they make up names for dishes that don't actually exist in nola (Chicken Tchoupitoulas? What's that?) And they have a dish called PLANTATION Fried Chicken Salad...... wtf is that supposed to mean? I was offended.",2 star rating,Waterspider A.

12/21/2010,"Southern California, CA","After reading many other Yelp reviews I was expecting more, better food and a better, more exciting overall experience. I was expecting something more like Mardi Gras. Maybe it was because we went for lunch on a Sunday. Maybe it was because it was Thanksgiving weekend. The waitress was very nice but the food was just as bland and boring as the atmosphere. With all the other great restaurants in Santa Barbara, I don't get the appeal of this place. Again, maybe our timing was off. Or maybe having eaten at Hungry Cat the night before, nothing could even come close.",3 star rating,Alex W.

3/25/2008,"Santa Clara, CA","Our first time dining here was about three or four years ago. I remember walking out FULL and VERY content. I had the Jambalaya and it was fantastic!  If I can still remember it now...you know it was fantastic. Luckily, when we arrived in Santa Barbara they were still open. It was Sunday night around 930pm. The hostess sat us right away next to the window. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I was contemplating on either the Creole Crawfish Crabcakes or the Louisiana Soft Shell Crabs. I love seafood!!!  Anyways, David suggested that we get the Palace Sampler Platter for Two.  It included chicken tchoupitoulas, caribbean coconut shrimp with tangy dipping sauce, blackend catfish, new york steak and brad pudding with whiskey cream sauce for dessert.  A little bit of everything in one platter, why not! We ordered and an another waiter came by with the bread basket. He apologized for not having a certain type of muffin, which was kind of funny because we would have never known. Plus, they were all good. It was an assortment of small muffins, corn bread with jalapenos and another muffin that was a bit softer. I wasn't sure what it was, but it was good. When the food platter came, it looked amazing. Our fork went straight for the New York Steak....it was great!  Juicy....just the way I like it. The creamy sauce made it even better...I think it was cajun hollandaise sauce. Yumm.. The Blackened Catfish was a little burnt, but wasn't sure if it was meant to be burnt, since they called it Blackend Catfish. The chicken was just okay. The grilled vegetable and rice was good. But the best part of the platter was the Caribbean Coconut Shrimp. OMG!!  It was crunchy and flaky. It went great with the tangy sauce. I could of had a whole plate full. Plus the whole dinner cost us under $75 including tip. Not bad at all..Oh....if I didn't mention it before, the customer service was excellent. They were attentive and very friendly.",4 star rating,Sujin C.

8/12/2008,"Goleta, CA","I try not to give too many five star votes for the express purpose of doing places like this justice. Whenever the parents come to town this is the go-to destination for a familial experience.First Star: The LocationPositioned in downtown Santa Barbara, but not on State Street, this restaurant gives you that beachy feel without knocking you over the head with the faux cheerfulness that is overwhelmingly apparent while walking the main drag. Great location for real people who want to share a meal together.Second Star: The AtmosphereThis place has the best atmosphere of any restaurant in the SB area. Not only do the pictures, murals, and random paraphernalia make you feel like you are in New Orleans, but every night all of the guests are encouraged to sing along to Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World."" This creates a really warming experience that lets you express the closeness you (hopefully) feel with those sharing a meal with you.Third Star: The ServiceAll of the servers are courteous, helpful, and knowledgeable about the food they serve. If you are stuck between two dishes they will help you decide, though its still difficult because everything here is so good; which brings us to the next stars...Fourth and Fifth Star: The FoodNo matter how enjoyable the atmosphere or nice the service, a restaurant can not be given five stars unless its food is phenomenal; this place has that facet covered. It's appetizers are tantalizingly good (I suggest the fried crayfish or artichoke hearts), its main courses are to die for (try the crayfish stuffed fillet), and its desserts are unique and delicious (mmmm, bread pudding). On top of all of this it has complimentary bread/muffins that take the meal up a whole other notch. Simply delicious.Sorry about the length of this review, but anything less simply wouldn't do a place like this justice. This palatial experience has me hook, line, and sinker.",5 star rating,David M.

10/29/2008,"San Dimas, CA","We were in Santa Barbara for the weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday. We arrived around 2P and walked around the pier and a bit on State Street. Then off to check into our motel and get settled. As we had brought our laptop I decided to check Yelp for a good place to eat dinner that night. Right away at the top of the list came up the The Palace Grill with 71 reviews and 4 1/2 stars. I looked at a few reviews and clicked on the link to their website. Everything checked out and I was quite enthused about going there for dinner that evening. We arrived about 5:45 and was seated immediately. The hostess was really friendly and everything was off to a good start. Next our waitress arrived, again another sweet and friendly person. We got our drinks and the buss boy brought us a basket of muffins and butter. There was quite a variety and all very, very good. It was now time to order and I decided on the house specialty, stuffed blackened filet mignon, and my wife got divers scallops. I added a bowl of seafood gumbo and my wife got a Creole Caesar salad. Oh, let's not forget that if you want their famous bread pudding for desert, you have to order it at the same time you order your meal. They have to prepare it and then bake it, all taking about 30 minutes. The soup and salad came promptly. I was looking forward to the gumbo as I am a fan of soups and spicy food . It looked good and I was ready to dig in. As I spooned through the soup looking for signs of shrimp and crayfish I saw none. But what was in abundance was pieces of Ahi tuna and loads of rice. There was also a bit of oil or grease that collected on the top so I mixed it around. Now, I'm not really a big fan of tuna in such a soup, and would prefer to have only shrimp and crayfish, that's just me, but I was going to let my taste buds decide. I tried the first spoonful and to me it was not at all what I expected. It was very bland and tasteless and had no kick to it at all, and as I said there was no shrimp or crayfish in sight, just tuna and rice. I was not impressed at all. Campbell's soup makes a thick and chunky variety called Grilled Chicken Sausage Gumbo that has the Palace's gumbo beat hands down! As for my wife's salad... she said it was OK, but nothing special. I also noticed her moving some big un-edible pieces of romaine hearts to the side of her dish. While waiting for our main course to come I was checking out the decor of the room. There are playing cards stuck on the ceiling, really! There is also a huge painting on the west wall of a black trumpet player dressed in a white suit. Not bad, it added to the room and gave it a feel of down south. But what I didn't expect to see next to the painting crawling down the wall was a cockroach, and on the shelf below it several other dead ones. May wife saw the look of surprise on my face and had a look. I almost wish she hadn't because no one wants to see such a thing. In fact, the young women sitting at the table next to the wall called one of the waitresses over and showed her the dead cockroaches. She promptly got a wet cloth and whisked them away. But still.... this was not a good sign and sort of set the mood for dinner.After about 20 minutes I was wondering if our dinner was ever coming. At that point our waitress came by and said our food would be out shortly. It really made me wonder if she had put the order in promptly or just forgot. I say this because the people next to us got their food about the same time as we did, and they arrived 10 minutes after us .Oh well, that's life.The food came and I dug in. It was nicely presenter and looked good, but didn't have much flavor. The stuffed filet was cold and tasteless. When I think of something blackened it brings forth memories of robust flavors and heat, but this had none. The scoop of mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables looked nice, but lacked flavor just like the filet. As for my wife's scallops... they were extremely salty and had an odd grilled flavor to them. Again, not a good experience. The owner's wife stopped by the table to chat a while. She was so nice I didn't have in me to tell her what I really thought of the dinner. I just told here everything was fine and left it at that. I know, I probably should have.... but I didn't. I hate any confrontation, that's just me. Well, we finally made it to desert and for what it's worth it was probably the only half way decent part of the meal. The waitress brought the bread pudding out and separated the center with two spoons and pored the whiskey cream sauce all over it. As the pudding was a bit dry on it's own, the sauce moistened it up nicely and made it quite tasty. I enjoyed it. All in all I was disappointed with our dinner. When you go out and spend well over 100 dollars for a meal you expect it to be good.  I can understand an unlucky experience with the meal, but one live cockroach crawling around and two dead ones visible is inexcusable!",2 star rating,William P.

9/9/2010,"Laguna Hills, CA","Truth be told, I give this place 1 1/2 stars.  Service was subpar:  They forgot my order; the server rarely came by to refill our drinks; plus, he was condescendingly friendly when you asked for anything.  If I remember correctly, my request went something like this: Me: ""Excuse me, can I get a refill on my iced tea? The mango iced tea?""Server: ""Oh (looks down). Sure.  By the way: all of our iced tea is mango.""  Walks away.Oh....sorry: my bad.  Guess I didn't see that written in the menu handed to you from God.  Forgive me. Anyway, the food is just ok.  If you've been to New Orleans, then the novelty and authenticity is lacking.  We ordered gumbo, salad, prawns, fried chicken, fried popcorn shrimp, tilapia fillet.  The seafood gumbo was pretty tasty but the portion is small.  For $5.95, I'd like more please.  Plus, anyone can make cajun-flavored tilapia filet.  You just walk down aisle 3 in your grocery store, pick up a bottle titled, ""Canjun Seasoning"" and sprinkle it on your fish.  That's about as good as it was for me.  Dessert was just ok.  I see a lot of people raving about the bread pudding souffle but honestly, it wasn't that great.  I've had better.  Acme Oysterhouse had the bomb bread pudding and that just blows away all the competition.Another thing, if you don't like people coming up to you and forcing you to join them in magic card tricks, or forcing you to sing ""What a Wonderful World"" and saluting your drink to no one in particular, then don't come here.  Seriously, not to be a debbie downer, but I wasn't into the card tricks and kumbaya pow-wow.  It's like telling an atheist to bow their head for supper prayer: some things just don't come naturally for all of us.  Besides, all I ask for is great food and decent service to give you at least 3 stars. Sorry to be a hater, but go somewhere else.  And don't come for dinner unless you enjoy paying $17-$22.95 on average per plate.",1 star rating,Tracy H.

I had the crawfish etoufee which was good but not spicy enough. I think what ruined my experience was that there was SO MUCH build up on this bread pudding souffle and I swear it did nothing for me. Nothing. The server tried to be a little cheek-y with the presentation but that didn't make up for the boringness of the dessert.

3/21/2011,"Beverly Hills, CA","Ambiance/Service:To be perfectly honest, the atmosphere seems a bit hokey and gimmicky.  The plastic streamers hanging from the ceiling and the plastic Mardi Gras beads that are hung from fake lamp posts detract from a quality atmosphere, in my opinion.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I liked that there was no one server for a particular table.  It allowed us to get the fastest service by flagging down any available server.  Service was good.  Food:Upon the recommendation of the server, we started with the crawfish popcorn for an appetizer.  It came with a creamy aioli dipping sauce.  It did not live up to its reputation. The crawfish was over battered and somewhat tough.  The dipping sauce was overly creamy and I lost interest in the dish after just a couple of pieces.  Despite this, the appetizer was just okay.  The entrees were a completely different story.  My gf had the jambalaya which was sublime.  The seasoning was spot on.  The variety of proteins from chicken to sausage to shrimp was an absolutely delicious combination.  It was hands down the best jambalaya I've ever had.  The portion size was also generous.  For my entree, I had creole crusted lamb chops.  They came out a bit rare at first, so I had them cook it a bit more.  The chops were seasoned nicely and again, delicious.  The side of vegetables that it came with were over powered with butter and almost inedible.  However, the chops were so good that I overlooked this.  The portion size again was generous.  For dessert, we had their freshly made bread pudding souffle.  My gf and I agree it is the best souffle we have ever had, and I hate souffle.  I must say I really enjoyed this dessert.  Really great meal overall.  Wrap-up:I would recommend The Palace Grill if you're looking for great flavors and nice portions.  The food came out extremely fast so that was a plus and the service was good.  It was a bit pricey, but I think it was worth it.  I would return just for that souffle.  Excellent meal.

6/5/2011,"Sunnyvale, CA","The bread pudding souffle is the only reason why I decided to come to The Palace Grill.  After seeing all the rave reviews about it, I penciled in this place in downtown Santa Barbara as my only dinner option for a Sunday night.  The bread pudding souffle was a wonderful dessert option to share with my date and you have to order it at the beginning of your meal to ensure that it's hot & fresh out of the oven.  I couldn't taste much of the grand mariner inside but the raisins were easily detectable.  What you definitely could taste is the whiskey cream sauce which was not too strong but sweet at the same time; wonderful combination.  Here are some other thoughts of the night:Popcorn Crawfish - A little overhyped.  It's nice that they bring the crawfish from Louisiana but the cornmeal buttermilk batter was just too much in comparison to how much crawfish you get.  There were many popcorn pieces that was just balls of batter with no crawfish.  After all was said and done, about 50% of my plate was left with fried batter.Pork Chop - You better be getting something really good if you're paying $30 for a pork chop and it almost met expectations.  A double cut pork chop was glazed with a sweet glaze which was a bit too sweet for our taste.  It was cooked very well but the flavor was a bit overpowering.  Our waiter said this entree is not always on the menu but it was so popular that they had to bring it back.  Mini Muffins (that come with the meal) - These little bundles of joy comes in maybe 5 different varieties and come fresh from the oven (we knew they were fresh because we sat right by the oven and we watched the workers take them out).  The flavors varied from jalapeno, rosemary, banana nut, and some sweet fruity flavor.  They could just bring out bread but I love changing it up for once as I've never got anything like this before at other restaurants.  We were tempted to ask for another basket but we knew we had more than enough food coming our way later in the meal.What a Wonderful World - Okay this isn't a food entree but out of nowhere, we were being passed booklets with the lyrics to this song and told to sing along when the music starts.   A bit unsure of what was going on, the music started and all the restaurant goers started singing and the waiters/waitresses were toasting drinks with all the customers.  How pleasant and what a nice moment (can't think of a similar type of moment at a restaurant).  It really brought a happy atmosphere to the restaurant and gave the workers a well deserved break to take a drink for a few minutes.  After asking our waiter the history behind the song being sung at the restaurant, he indicated that the original owner saw this occur in Louisiana back in the day and decided to incorporate it into The Palace Grill; only when the restaurant is at full capacity.  With the kind of business that these guys get, they must certainly get to that level at least a couple times a night.  Mini muffins & bread pudding souffle...what a wonderful world.",4 star rating,Albie F.

We got the crawfish popcorn since a lot of people yelped about it. We thought it was just, the batter was soggy, but I think it had been sitting there for quite some time since it wasn't piping hot. We also had the bread pudding souffle...now that is the thing to get here. It was very good and almost as good as the one we had in Louisiana. The souffle comes with a white cream sauce...not too sweet and not too bland. I wish they had timed it right so both were piping hot but oh well. I'll have to come back to this place to give it a fair review.",4 star rating,Leslie B.

7/8/2011,"Fremont, CA","One of the most interesting restaurants I've been to in a long time.1.) There was a duet/band outside playing jazz music right outside the front door while you waited to be seated.  2.) Services was attentive and very friendly3.) They handed out little cards that stated ""Do not open until the music starts""  I had originally thought it was a raffle, but turns out to be lyrics for music they were playing.  The waiters/owners will come out and toast with you during the music (at proper parts of the song).(my usual reviews below)1.) Parking - I had walked here from my hotel, but lots of street parking/parking lots in the area2.) Restaurant was clean and service had a sense of humor.  They had made our neighboring table a dessert (banana sundae) shaped like a penis for his birthday :-p3.) The bread/muffins (6 of them) were really good.  The jambalaya was really really good...I really wish I wasn't too full to have the bread pudding dessert which takes 30 minutes to make.",4 star rating,Omar L.

9/27/2011,"Tarzana, CA",Came with a group of 6 at 2:30 in a Sunday. They close up at 3:00 to get ready for dinner. They had no problem accommodating us. They ran out of the free muffins that come before the meal but they made a special batch for us and brought them out warm with butter. Nothing better than warm fresh banana nut muffins and jalapeno corn muffins with butter. Two of us ordered the jambalaya and it was too salty but Chase our wonderful waiter switched it out for us with a smile. We got crawfish poboys instead. Tasted pretty good but could have had a bit more sauce or mayo but had great flavor. The Hurricane drinks were EXCELLENT!! I would definitely return!!,4 star rating,Lala L.

1/4/2012,"Seal Beach, CA","Initially we came because this place has 400-something reviews and managed to maintain 4 stars.  The menu had very tasty options, a lunch menu, and desserts.  We tried the seafood gumbo, which was delicious. For him it was too seafood-y. For me it was fine because I enjoy seafood.  We both ordered lunch sandwiches- crawfish po' boy and soft shell crab po'boy.  Delicious. The po' boy bread was light enough so it didn't overbear the flavor of the fried deliciousness within.  It's served with potato wedges. They were broiled I think.  For dessert, they have this great bread pudding souffle with whiskey sauce.  You must try this dessert.  You won't be disappointed.  Sitting around, we heard a bunch of people say they've been to the establishment multiple times. It's definitely a gem. We would go back again, too.",5 star rating,M D.

I like the jumbalaya pasta or the blackened catfish. Fun music too!,4 star rating,Roopa D.
6/1/2005,"San Francisco, CA","The Palace is a distinctive Cajun-Creole restaurant whose food and ambiance have the color of New Orleans with shades of the upscale downtown Santa Barbara in which it is situated. The signature dishes are all top-notch, particularly the Cajun crawfish popcorn appetizer and the whiskey bread pudding souffle dessert. (The only disappointing entree I've had there is the soft-shell crab.) The Cajun martini is delicious and voluminous; it is made with gin that has had a giant jalapeno soaking in it for a week, and it is served in the quart-sized canning jar in which the gin and jalapeno were stored. The tables are somewhat closely spaced, and the Louis Armstrong is usually played many decibels too loud, but the resulting roaring din contributes to the boisterous Nolans feel that the Palace is meant to capture.",4 star rating,Eugene P.
11/17/2007,"Fremont, CA","This place is delightful! The atmosphere, the decoration, and the service are notable. We were very lucky that someone did a no-show, so we got a table within 10 minutes without reservation. But I strongly recommend phone ahead or make a reservation. This place was packed on a Wednesday night!!They serve muffins instead of dinner bread. There were different types of muffins; jalapeos, molasses, banana, cornbread, etc. My favorites are molasses and banana. They were warm, crumbly, and sooo very gooood. I can have them as my entree. We had Lemon Drop Martini and Cranberry Spin Martini. They were served in a pint mason jar with a strainer. It is really cute and different, but by the time we have room to pour rest of the alcohol into our martini glass, the alcohol is already watered down from the ice in the jar. It tasted really nasty.We ordered Diver's Scallops and Crawfish Popcorn (most popular) for our appetizers. The popcorn was excellent. The scallops (2) were mediocre. The menu made it sound much better than it is. They were a bit small for the price (quarter size in diameter and 1/4in thickness). I would not order the scallops again for appetizer or entree. They were made in a way that I could have made at home and not worth the money.I had Blackened Fresh Ahi Tuna as my entree. The ahi was sushi grade. I had it cooked rare, so it was still raw in the middle. The ahi steak was very delicious and fresh. The seasoning was a bit salty on the ahi.  I mentioned to our server that I am on a low carb diet, but she failed to tell me that the Ahi is served with potato, or how I would like my potato, or if I want to replace the potato with vegetables. It was very disappointing when I received my plate of food and I saw the two fist-size red potatoes rolling around on my plate.My friend had the Jambalaya Pasta. It was heavenly! There were shrimps and chicken in the pasta. The sauce was plentiful but not overpowering. You can get Large or XLarge with the pasta. The Large is humongous. The XLarge is best for two people. You can save a bit of money by sharing too.Unfortunately, we did not order any dessert. We were full to the max! However, the Bread Pudding Souffle is very famous and popular. The server told us that they bake it fresh, so if we want to try it, we have to order it as we order our food. Definitely something to try next time.Halfway through our dinner, around 8pm, the hostess passed out the lyric to What a Wonderful World, the music began to play shortly after. Everyone was singing and all the servers toasted the customers one by one. It was fun, but I was more concerned about getting back to my food.I highly recommend this place for dates, group dining, and just a night out.",4 star rating,Angela Y.

My boss David and I went while working in Santa Barbara a few weeks ago, by recommendation even though both of us are not that keen on cajun/creole food.The minute we sat down, we felt a great vibe and fit rite in. The martini's served in mason jars were vibrant and so delicious. Our server made sure they were filled up at every opportunity. The ambiance was classy with a touch of eclectic - funky/classy. we ordered the crayfish cake (like a crab cake), but I think even better. It was simple and cooked right, with a delicious bur blanc sauce over the top...mmm a perfect balance of texture and flavor.They serve a mixed mini muffin basket with butter instead of bread and each different muffin was better than the first. Fun and different twist over a regular old bread basket (my favorite was the corn jalapeno).We shared our entrees which were the veal medallions and the rack of lamb. The sauce and noodles that came with the veal medallions was so rich and delicious... maybe a little too much to finish, but you just can't stop getting more bites of the sauce in your mouth. The lamb was PERFECTLY cooked and had excellent grill flavor with a nice pairing of veggies on the side. Half way though dinner, the hostess dropped off at our table a card that she asked we not open until the ""music starts"". We looked at each other and and said OK (thinking this was weird and that we don't was to do any dinner participation).

It's so nice to make a reservation, and not have to wait while they clean tables, figure out how fit you in etc... Other than that, I had the crawfish etouffe and the bread pudding which were both good and they brought my boyfriend a birthday ice cream and sang to him.  It was overall an A+ experience for everyone.",5 star rating,Maria A.

Ok let me back track..I completely neglected to mention the muffins that they serve before ur meal.  Delicious flavors! Yummmmm. My friend had the barbeque prawns...and they made my mouth water.....so delicious! She also ordered the mash potatoes and they made me want kidnap the cook! Sooooo good. Now onto the banana pudding souffle...it's hands down amazingly great. Seriously I didn't think it could get any better and it did!

1/31/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","I went here with family in 2014 and thought this place was great. So fast forward to the present day, date night. took my girl out to eat and decided to take here to this place. It was a Friday night around 7pm and the place was maybe three quarters full. We ordered our food and I ordered a cappuccino but the machine was broken. I tried to ask if they had regular coffee and the waiter just took off with our menus. The food was great, but the waiter kept pushing us to hurry up. We were enjoying our meal and you could just see the relief on the guy's face once we asked for boxes to go. I mean I get it, I'm a 21 year old dude who has worked in food service and now works at a hotel. I know if it's busy it's busy, but if this place was filled to the brim, line out the door, like it can be on some days I'd really understand. This was not the case. No line, plenty of tables. Like I said, the food was really good. but the two team members who stopped by every now and then were borderline rude.",2 star rating,Frank W.

The food was pretty good but did not blow me away like I was expecting. I had the soft shelled crabs, which I love, but they were lacking some flavor. I should have followed my boyfriend's lead and ordered the jambalaya pasta. The staff is great and the place has a really fun vibe. I finished off the meal with the pecan pie, one of my favorite dishes, and was so-so about it. The points mainly come from the atmosphere - lots of fun!",4 star rating,kate t.

Lol.  Bread pudding was great, as was everything on the sampler platter we split.  I loved the 2 guys out front playing Zydeco music while you waited.  And yes, there's the obligitory Louis Armstrong song everyone is asked to sing - I liked that all the staff comes around and 'cheers' you.  So any downside? They only have a Hurricane Margarita and a Hurricane Martini, not a eal Hurricane.  But the Hurricane Margarita was potent and not too sweet - one of the best I've ever had.",5 star rating,Amy S.

I couldn't stop eating! It was all SOOO GOOD!!! We actually asked if we could swap out the catfish for the crawfish because we were really curious to try to crawfish and it came out wrong, with the catfish, but we didn't even care- the catfish was delicious!! who knew CATFISH could be so tastey!? Anyways, the server noticed the error and still brought us the crawfish in addition to the combo. And it was good, although not crazy amazing as the rest... seriously, do yourself a favor and get the combo! with the catfish! and it also includes bread pudding!! YUMMOOO!!!AND FINALLY...

10/9/2010,"Summerland, CA","The food was excellent however the price, the atmosphere, and the service really bring down my rating.  The $$ is accurate, however most appetizers are $15 and dinner entrees are $20-$25, so its pretty easy to rack up a $100 bill.  The atmosphere is very loud and crowded.  When you walk in, you are bombarded with sounds from the kitchen and roar of conversation.  It made it really hard to have a normal conversation and talk to servers.  My server was nice but not very helpful.  When I asked what dish was their specialty, he suggested the two variety platters i.e. the two most expensive items on the menu.  I wasn't sure if this was an honest opinion or a means to rack up our bill.  I ended up choosing the Jumbalaya pasta which was quite tasty.I really like the food because the overall experience wasn't very pleasant, I gave it 3 stars.  If you don't mind eating in a louder more crowded restaurant and have a little extra ""$$"" to spend, I'd definitely recommend the Palace Grill.",3 star rating,Christopher C.

They served six different kinds (12 total) of mini muffins and they were ALL (literally, all) delicious! On to the main courses...no complaints! It was all really good--even the leftovers the next day were good. The entire staff was extremely nice and friendly and the service was really good. I asked for our leftover muffins to be put in a to-go bag (why throw it away when I can enjoy it for 4th meal?) and the waitress even added a bunch more in the bag--so nice! The decor of the place was really great, as well. It actually brought me back mentally to my New Orleans visit. We went on a Monday night, but judging on the number of guests they had, you would have thought it was a Friday. No wait, though, which was great. The only thing I would caution about is that this place is a little on the pricey side and it gets a little loud, so you have to really listen to what the people you are with are saying. However, I think it's absolutely worth it. Great atmosphere and food and super friendly staff, all in all. Will definitely be back!",5 star rating,M B.

I'm not huge on Cajun food but I loved it!  We ordered coconut shrimp for our appetizer, salads, and pasta. We shared a bottle of Zin and for dessert - nothing gets better than the bread pudding! Absolutely fabulous!  And since it was my birthday they put a candle in it for me and wrote Happy Birthday Brenda in chocolate around the plate.  It was a nice touch.  The food was awesome, the service was perfect and the atmosphere was relaxing and entertaining at the same time.

7/20/2009,"Goleta, CA","Whenever I feel like dropping a good amount of money to eat, I pick Palace Grill.The Crawfish Popcorn or Oysters Palace are great starters. I usually get the Jambalaya over rice which is consistently great, though I wish there was some more kick to it (cue Tabasco). I've tried most of the pastas off my friends' plates, but the one I liked best was the one with Italian sausage. Never tried the steaks, but my friend said it was the best in town and I'll have to get it next time.The muffins they give for free are always delicious; I love how they have a variety in a basket to mix things up.The Cajun Martini is very unique and has a spice to it from the jalapeno, and is definitely not for the weak in tolerance. A pint jar really had me going, but it is surprisingly addicting. The cherry peppers is a nice touch as well.It's a great dining experience with their unique ""team service"", and if you have to wait for a table they'll have live entertainment on some days (I've witnessed a band and a card trick magician). They also have the restaurant sing ""What a Wonderful World"" a certain time (don't remember when) while the staff come around clinking glasses; a great touch!

4/1/2011,"Emeryville, CA","OVER PRICED! The food are just not that good at all! We ordered the Cajun Crawfish popcorn for appetizer.  It was one step above fast-food, it lacked seasoning but it was a good portion size.  For entree we got Crawfish Etouffee and Cajun Lamb Chops.  The etouffee had the spice kick to it but the flavor was lacking, since it doesn't fuse the flavors of the peppers and onions in well. The lamb was good, the sauce was good but the white cap mushroom flavor took a lot away from the sauce. It distracted the taste buds, for the price they of the dish they could have used a higher quality mushroom. On the positive side, the Bread pudding desert was good, it was a bit too sweet but good (1 star).  The staff is friendly and the service is superb, and it does have excellent atmosphere (a little loud but not bad) (1 star).We've gone to Range in SF (yelp.com/biz/range-san-f…) and Fresca in SF (yelp.com/biz/fresca-san-…) and our meal which was not as good as theirs fell in between those two places for dinner for two.  Overall for the price we expect better quality food with more flavor.",2 star rating,Arthur L.

The place is very loud, so if your looking for a quiet atmosphere this is not for you. This place has a fun vibe. I've never been in a restaurant that gets everyone involved like they do. The best part of the night was during the middle of our meal they handed out the lyrics to ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong on every table, and told everyone to sing a long if they wanted to. Hahaha the whole place was singing it was great. And in the end everyone took their glass and cheered with the people at the next table and the waiters. Now the food..... I ordered the seafood gumbo and it was sooooo good. For dessert I highly recommend the bread pudding...delicious. Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely coming back.",5 star rating,Michelle C.
1/4/2013,"Moraga, CA","We had dinner yesterday. It was a fairly good experience. I had the Jambalaya, which was good, though a bit messy in terms of plating. The fried crayfish appetizer was nice, but a little heavy (a thinner batter would probably make these critters shine better). I had a baked dessert (a bread pudding with chocolate mousse) which cooked too long so it dried out inside (still tasty). The kids liked their kiddie menus. I would rate the place 4 stars, if it didn't have ceiling fans running full steam ... in winter. Not only it feels a bit chilly, but the food gets cold in three minutes. Go figure!",3 star rating,Leo M.

9/25/2012,"St Pete Beach, Tampa Bay, FL","My boyfriend and I went here for dinner over Labor Day weekend. It was my first time here though he had been there many times before about 10 years ago. My first impression walking in was that the place needed to be updated. Dinner was pretty good. Cajun cuisine. We shared one of the combinations which gave us a variety of things in a large portion. Actually it was great!  The etouffee was definitely one of my favs.  They have mason jar sizes of martinis! Pretty awesome if you like martini. The staff there is really great too. They are on their game and very friendly. For dessert, our waiter had ""welcome back"" written in chocolate around the plate for my boyfriend who mentioned he hadnt been there in 10 years. Very nice gesture. There is also a magician that walks around and does some magic tricks, great for the kids, but entertaining for the adults too. Overall, this place is great!",5 star rating,Michelle h.
11/30/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I have lived in Santa Barbara since birth, moving away and coming back.  The Palace Grill has always been elusive in my mind.  Never having been there, it only stood on its reputation.  Tonight my family and I embarked on the adventure of cajun cooking.   It was Mc Palace, perhaps only a shade better than McDonalds.   YUCK!!!!!   Fried everything and not to mention the green pepper covered etouffee.  Cajun cuisine is not new to our diets, so we were expecting something a bit more authentic.  Service was good, not great. Poor food",1 star rating,Tania R.

I've been to SB so many times and this place never sparked my interest until my mother-in-law and her hubby insisted we go there for dinner. Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! It's located just off the main street which is State St.(cross street is Cass). It's a little place that is very quaint, doesn't take reservations so you put your name-in and stand in line (so worth it though). While waiting in line, we were listening to this awesome trio that was playing the blues right in front of the restaurant (literally on the curb). We had the creole crawfish crabcake, crawfish app, habanero martini, and for the main dish I got the Chicken Marsala...I know I know...you would think Italian right....but no...by far the best Chicken Marsala I have EVER had!!! Delicious! My husband got the stuffed steak which was also amazing! Must Try NOW!",5 star rating,Marcela G.

9/29/2011,"Las Vegas, NV","Yes, I came and tried the world famous Palace Grill. The wait was a half hour which wasn't bad considering how popular this place is. To kill time I just did some window shopping. First of all this place has a reputation for customer service.. according to what the reviews say. Second..they have a reputation for having great food but it is on the pricey side. They serve complimentary muffins, all different kinds...carrot, cinnamon raison, and jalapeno cheddar. I had the jumbaloya??? (I think I spelled it right) the traditional is served with rice or you have the option of getting the pasta. I wanted it the traditional way but I feel kas if I made the wrong choice. I think if I went for the pasta, I would have gotten more bang for my buck, which is what I tend to think about when it comes to food. I want good food for a good price but I want it to be worth the money. Anyways....I must say that the crab cakes are tasty as well. We sat next to the bakery kitchen where they make all the soufle's....and muffins. It smelled so good. For dessert we ordered a chocolate soufle, the presentation of the dish was sweet, if I get a chance I will upload a picture, but the soufle was YUMMY!",3 star rating,Gisselle S.
7/18/2011,"Denver, CO","I entered excited and left disappointed. After reading about all the great reviews I  am just not sure Louisiana food is for me. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy crawfish and seafood but was not impressed by the popcorn crawfish, jumbalaya pasta, or seafood gumbo, which all tasted very bland. For the price paid for the main dish ($28) it surely was not worth it. On Yelp this establishment is given $$ dollar signs when in actuality it should be $$$. I can only assume that the lunch menu is what might give this place its two $$ sign because prices are way cheaper! There is an option to have dinner for lunch but not lunch for dinner. The noise level was loud, seating area was limited to 3-4 dozen people, however service was decent.  Again, I have a limited idea of Louisiana style foods and I left disappointed but would still be open to trying such culinary foods. I suppose until I go to Louisiana will I be able to know what Cajun food is really like, but for now, I'll have to pass on Palace Grill. Four ok dishes for the price paid left me bummed because the ratings were so high for this place.",2 star rating,Wonder W.

1/4/2012,"Tustin, CA","This was now my second time eating here (both for birthdays) and we were very pleased with our experience. We love New Orleans and this place has a great authentic vibe as they play great music and have very relevant decor. The food is very tasty although somewhat heavy- which is to be expected. We got the ""best of"" sampler plate which was a bit expensive ($75) but came with a ton of food. It says the meal is for 2 on the menu but it could easily feed 4. The service is wonderful as several people, including the manager, made sure to check if everything was good with our experience. I told them it was my husband's birthday while I was making the reservation and at the end of our meal they brought out a dessert plate with a personalized birthday message written on the plate with hardened chocolate...talk about planning ahead! The only thing that was a little disappointing was the soft shell crab, we have had better. This place can also get a bit pricey but we splurged a bit because we had a gift certificate. Besides that, the food, service and overall experience was excellent!",4 star rating,Anna And John A.
12/31/2011,"Concord, CA","We were in town Christmas week and my husband offered to take me out to celebrate my birthday. I chose The Palace Grill on the strength of the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. First, let me note that we were walk-ins around 6PM. The main room was booked, but the manager told us that she'd take us in 15 minutes, after opening up another part of the dining room, so we strolled around State Street, which was pleasant with all the festive holiday lights. I did tell her that we were happy to get in, as it was my birthday and she noted that in her book (asked me to spell my first name). When we returned from our stroll, she had a window table ready for us. The ambiance was nice, though I think the main room (which was full) was a bit nicer.....but hey, I was just happy to get a table, especially as I watched the lines outside forming outside the door later in the evening.We skipped appetizers due to a large lunch earlier and went straight for the entrees. I ordered Diver Scallops on a rice pilaf with jalapeno buerre blanc sauce, artichokes and mushrooms and my husband ordered the jambalaya over dirty rice. Our server was gracious and she advised us as we were ordering dinner to decide if we wanted two desserts on the menu that need to be started as soon as the chef fires dinner. The desserts were the Louisiana Bread Pudding/souffle with creamy whiskey sauce or a rich chocolate souffle. I chose the bread pudding since it was a signature of the house. The scallop entree was wonderful...the flavors melded together perfectly and the amount was just right (especially since scallops are so rich). My husband said his jambalaya was good, but he wished he could have had ""regular"" bread on the side. They just offer a basket of small muffins in a variety of flavors. He felt he could have used the bread to soak up all the sauce (it was the sauciest looking jambalaya I ever saw, which I don't think is actually a good thing, but he felt it was tasty). The dessert was great - the bread pudding actually did not need the creamy whiskey sauce. In fact, I didn't detect any whiskey in it at all. Tasted very much like the icing on cinnamon buns, in fact. So, I used it sparingly. The bread pudding souffle was fluffy, not too sweet and lightly tinged with cinnamon and raisins. As I dug my way through that,  a plate of fresh vanilla ice cream was presented with a candle and a birthday greeting with my name scrawled out in  chocolate sauce. My husband, who did not order a dessert, ended up eating most of that and commented that the ice cream was very good. I would definitely go here again and try out some of the other items on the menu (and maybe not eat such a large lunch the same day)! It was a nice way to spend my birthday. NOTE: parking can be tough, so park in the residential areas and walk a few blocks.",4 star rating,Lari B.

6/23/2008,"Brea, CA","At the last winery (last of 4 wineries and somewhere around 30 tasting glasses later) the girl at the winery and 2 patrons both raved about the Palace.  These people drove up from Ventura just to have some wine, eat at the Palace and drive back home.  That is pretty hard core friends.  We decided to be more casual and ditched out Bouchon reservations for the Palace.  There were some hit and misses but overall I did enjoy the food.  I went to new Orleans 2 days after this meal and didn't find better gumbo at 4 different well received places in New Orleans.  I shit you not people.  The gumbo at the Palace has a lovely broth with a nice kick.  The okra was big soft and plentiful.  There were chunks of andouile, chicken and shrimp.  The gumbo was great - call me crazy but better than any of the more ""authentic"" lifeless gumbo in the Big Easy.  The popcorn crawfish was nice and the softshell crab was good.  In and of themselves those two dishes were good and reasonably priced.  But that damn gumbo man.",4 star rating,Jerrold S.

I work in the food industry so I have to admit I'm pretty judgemental. First the service-it was very good, our waiter was very friendly and very informative.As far as the food goes, we were happy with the soft shell crab but dissapointed with the Jambalaya dish-it lacked spice and the sausage was difficult to find and a bit dry.We were torn on weather to order the chocolate souffle or the bread pudding,our waiter said he would make ""an exception and split the desserts in half for us"" he said they do'n usually do that. I came to see that many other folks had the same split. We were not impressed with either one-they were ok but we've had much better. At the end of the night we were give a closed menu and told not to open it. When we were told to open it- all the wait staff started singing ""what a wonderful world-by Mr. Armstong-it was a bit corney-but different and added to the overall experience.

7/18/2010,"Ashland, OR","The whole ""team"" approach the servers take just doesn't work. No one is really looking out for your table as they all share the duties, and tips I guess. We barely saw anyone--and when they came by it was always too late for what we needed. They announced ""if you want the bread pudding you have to order 1/2 hour ahead of time, so does anyone want it?"" before we ordered dinner. Then when dinner came out, no one asked us anything or ever came back to check on us. I would have sent mine back but no one came by and eventually I just ate around the parts that weren't good. (It was a pasta/steak dish and the steak was weird and gristly so I just ate the pasta). Anyhow, I did want bread pudding but by the time they came to ask if we needed anything else it was too late for me to wait for it....I had coffee and then eventually when someone came by I asked for a refill. He brought decaf for everyone and poured it without asking. Um. What? I don't want decaf! But by the time I realized he had done that, he was of course gone and so I couldn't rectify it. All that for HUGE amounts of money.

And it did not disappoint, It's probably the best food that we've got in Santa Barabar! On the menu, they have a special session for the first time visitors, where they provide a big platter of assorted food, so that you can try many different dishes at once. We ordered the platter (it came with a big desert too) and it was great! It has deep fried coconut shrimps, grilled fish, poached chicken, steak, and grilled vegetables. It's a lot of food for just two people. Everything tastes really good. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that the food is a bit greasy. Also, the restaurant provides an awesome atomsphere. It's very family-frendily and warm. All the staff at the place are nice and attentive.

The best time to come here is when it's busy because every once in a while all the waiters will pass out lyrics for What a Wonderful World and the song will play and everyone chimes in and sings, it's a super fun time. Recently came here again and we ordered the Seafood Gumbo and the Jambalaya Pasta. Instead of bread and butter, each table gets a basket of mini cornbread muffins, each a different flavor. It's fun to try the different kinds, there are like 5 or so total. The Gumbo was surprisingly delicious, each spoonful had an assortment of ingredients and flavors. The jambalaya pasta is great for sharing as it's a large portion, it has a nice spice and is full of shrimp and sausage. They have cocktails, but not a super large selection, they mostly have a large wine list. I've come here before and their chocolate soufflé is amazing. Highly recommend if you're celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. They write happy birthday on the plate in chocolate and add a scoop of ice cream to it (that part is free).

The food came out quickly and the servers were very attentive. Then for dessert we celebrated the ladies born in the month of October. What a wonderful day has that. Lol!  Mondo, thank you for celebrating with us, we totally loved the toast and cheer of Birthday celebration. We'll be back Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Kim P.
3/18/2021,"Los Angeles, CA",THE WORST CREOLE FOOD EVERRRRR! How this place has been in business for over 35 years is baffling to me. The jambalaya pasta was a bunch of slop with tomato sauce and grease. No flavor whatsoever. Stay far away from this place.,1 star rating,Docbruin H.
12/19/2019,"Industry, CA","Came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 7, and we got lucky as there was no wait. The ambiance, food & service were wonderful. Our server Anne was great, and everyone was so friendly and courteous. The ambiance brings you back to New Orleans and the food is really good. Good portions at reasonable prices. I was hoping for chargrilled oysters, but their Oysters Palace did not disappoint! Our meal ended with a Louisiana Bread Pudding which was warm & delicious; they served it with a sweet message which I thought was so thoughtful. Oh, and the sing along was fun! Overall, it was a really good experience! Food was good, service was excellent, and we left with smiles on our faces.",5 star rating,April A.

8/8/2019,"Santa Clarita, CA","Let me start by saying we came in on Father's Day, made reservations ahead of time and drove 65 miles to get here. We were a party of 17, including children. Because of the long drive and unexpected traffic, several of the party were running about 20 mins late. We called ahead, no problem. We came here because my father is from Louisiana so we figured a good cajun place on Father's Day was appropriate. We were not disappointed.The atmosphere is relaxed but lively. The staff is all very friendly. I personally had the pecan chicken picatta. I asked the server his recommendation between 2 different dishes and he suggested this one. I'm glad he did because he was right. The appetizers and desserts were great. We always look forward to the beignets which never disappoint. They make great specialty cocktails. We were a little cramped at the table because of the shape of the dining room but it was sufficient.Afterwards we took a stroll up and down State Street which is always entertaining. I really enjoyed this place.",4 star rating,Byron P.
