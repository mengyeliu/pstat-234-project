3/10/2021,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA","Ate lunch here while we were visiting Solvang for the day. We had to wait in a line but the line was worth it. They have a bunch of tables to sit at outside so seating wasn't a problem. The food was super good. We got the hot wings, sausages, and fish and chips. The fish and chips were decent but the wings were so delicious, as well as the sausages. The beer was also really good. They have a bunch of different sizes of beer. Their french fries that came with the fish and chips wwre so delicious! The inside of the restaurant was super cool. The bathrooms were fun but definitely needed upkeeping.",5 star rating,Brit A.
10/26/2020,"Camarillo, CA",Solvang Brewing is a cute little spot. Busy during the touristy seasons and weekends.I would suggest getting here a little early to beat the crowds and to get a good seat.I would say service was average- not bad not great. There were moments when our waitress was on top of things and then long lags in her checking on us to get a fresh drink. Like I said they get busy so realistically it wasn't too bad. The bar was popping and I could see that they were cranking out drinks left and right.The food was definitely good. Always a fan of bar type finger foods and appetizers. Our group was satisfied and our favorite overall were the wings. Good sauce and a nice crunch. Our cocktails were also pretty good. They have a good selection and I'd say a well versed menu to accommodate most people.It's very casual and a great stop along your Solvang journey. I'd be back and again just recommend getting inside a little before noon to ensure some seats.,4 star rating,Melissa L.

11/4/2020,"Monrovia, CA","Grabbed some takeaway dinner here on a business trip about a month ago. The restaurant has a great atmosphere! Very cozy and welcoming! At the time, it was all outdoor seating only, but the very next day, they were allowed to move to socially-distanced indoor seating.The staff were very helpful and friendly. There's plenty of room for social distancing and everyone wears masks. My 3-stars was for the wait-time and the food quality. We ordered our items to go and had to wait for ages! Not sure why bc all we ordered was wings, soup and a salad. The hot wings were pretty standard - good but average. Had plenty of crudités so that was nice! I ordered the Choice Garden Salad with the vinaigrette- the greens had a nice variety and were ample, but sadly the dressing was minimal and pretty bland. I also ordered the French Onion Soup and I have to say it was probably one of the worst ones I've ever had. It was black - couldn't tell if it was made with too much Stout or if it was actually burnt - and it seemed like it had been sitting for a long time bc the bread in the soup had absorbed so much of the broth and was so mushy. Very disappointed in the soup. So bottom line for us - the staff and ambiance were great but the food, not so much. Doubt we'd return.",3 star rating,Hannah S.

4/30/2021,"Lompoc, CA","Not impressed. We have been here before pre covid and had a decent experience. This time was a big disappointment...we did a pick up order. The burgers were done the opposite of what we asked. Got the carnitas nachos and lets just say sometimes less is more. It was a pile of inedible slop, squished into a styrafoam container. When picking up, we were pushed from place to place til finally able to pay...where gratuity is forced at 18% after being treated rudely and getting the order half wrong. Definitely not returning.",2 star rating,Michelle W.
1/23/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","We arrived yesterday in Solvang, looking for a good dinner.  We were recommended to go to Solvang Brewing Company.  This could not have been a better choice.  The service was excellent with Aubrey.  She helped us with what to order and what a help she is!! Our family got nachos, fish and chips and pizza.  We were so pleased with it.  Sometimes you need the comfort of this food.  I only wish we could have dined in at the restaurant.  Everyone was warm and friendly who worked there.  I would return ANYtime!!",5 star rating,Seth B.
4/6/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA",Visit recently as it was opening back up outside. Had a nice time I think it needs a bit of refurbishing since it is a staple of Solvang.  Food was good and drinks were good!,3 star rating,Alysha T.

3/28/2021,"San Francisco, CA","Worst dining experience I've ever had.First, meals are overpriced and the quality doesn't even justify the cost.Second, you order AND PAY in advance, which other restaurants don't do.Third, YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED AN 18% GRATUITY -- without your consent or knowledge -- so my group ended up tipping a total of 30%+ since we tipped on top of that undisclosed automatic charge.Fourth, WE WAITED OVER AN HOUR to get our group's last meal. The first plate arrived after 30 minutes of waiting. Looking around there were many other tables discontent waiting just as long for food, pissed off, and ready to leave. On the way out, we talked with a few other guests who were also disappointed and one group was considering escalating the poor service on a physical level.On behalf of all the unhappy guests who dined on 3/27/21, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick and convenient meal, and I am definitely never eating here again myself because the experience was that awful. The two servers were doing their best so it's likely that the kitchen itself was understaffed. No matter the reason, the cashier should never have charged his customers an automatic 18% gratuity, and Solvang Brewing Company should have had the decency of informing guests of the 30 minute to hour long wait.",1 star rating,Jasmin B.
1/17/2021,"Pico Rivera, CA","The American burger is where it's at! This Saturday (1/16/20) morning I encountered a two man iron crew. One employee in the front taking orders and the other in the kitchen cranking out delicious food. Wait time was still less than 15min. Spectacular service! The American burger was perfect, it was delicious. The toasted brioche bun combined with the house sauce definitely makes this a must try burger.",5 star rating,Omar F.
4/7/2021,"Studio City, CA","Waited for an hr to get 3 sausages, pretzel and kids burger that was half raw inside. U would think it would be cooked fully after such a long wait. I was here many years back and wanted to try the sausages again but it sure wasn't the same.  One kitchen guy for the whole restaurant, no way the business will survive after this until they move the game on and get more employees. If u pay by credit card 18% gratuity will automatically be charged. So u pre order ur food, take a number and wait. I wish them well in the future since they've been around.",1 star rating,Sucharkin L.

5/4/2021,"San Diego, CA","I wanted to come here via our annual ""Buellton"" trip with the gang.  We were here October 2020 and imbibed their Bloody Mary's, which was one the best things that they had to offer, in my opinion.  When you get a couple pieces of thick bacon slices, several olives and a few celery sticks~which coincidentally I consider a meal~with the drink, you know you have hit paydirt.  Well, that was nearly a half year ago.  Nowadays, the same drink is the same price and now is just a ho-hum of a Mary.....Oh, well, glad that my better half & I were able to get Bloody Mary meals last year.....We will be looking for other places next year and see what's on the docket....wish us luck and hope everyone is doing good and looking forward to a life without wearing face masks~again!",3 star rating,Alex A.
5/15/2021,"Torrance, CA",Ok had food and drinks at this place. I gave it a 3star because you had to order verses a waitress taking your order. And I didnt like the fact when using your credit card that they added 18% tip to your order.  Also took 1 hour to receive your food. You should have more staff to handle customer service better. Its not nice to wait so long for the food...,3 star rating,Monika L.
5/24/2021,"Newport Beach, CA","Been coming here for awhile for business. Today was the most disappointing visit. Even with everything opening up u would think ppl would be motivated to help customers, we got attitude from the young servers. The food is not great and super expensive. Soo sad we love it here. Tomato soup was warm not hot. No crackers or bread tasted like spaghetti sauce. Ordered a pizza to go. Walked across the street to eat in hotel and it was cold little under cooked. Like I don't get it. Wouldnt restaurants want to go above and beyond the customer service after being slow from covid. I hope things get better.",1 star rating,Jen S.
5/8/2021,"Tracy, CA","Yes, like some ppl wrote earlier, ppl are busy here, no time to talk or care about customer service, food is good, drinks are ummm ok, slight weak but ok. This is business so they are making money. 18% automatic gratuity not cool. But again like someone wrote, Nick is awesome to talk to. He is one of the guys actually asking us if we are good or if we need anything. So if you see Nick give him good tip.. best part of brewing company...",4 star rating,Binny S.
11/14/2020,"San Diego, CA",Horrible service! We got in the waiting list and they told us it was going to be around 25 minutes and we've been here for at least one hour and no one has called us PLUS they offered us to wait at the bar while they called us and at the bar the service is terrible. The guy just don't want to help us! He knows we are here having appetizers and drinks but we've been waiting as well for refills and NADA!! This place sucks,1 star rating,Adriana R.

1/27/2021,"Los Alamitos, CA","Solvang, I love this little Danish town, I have been here a milion times. We were passing through on our way to San Jose and we stopped over here to have some food and well, Since i was driving i couldnt have a Tap beer. I have  a soda or a water. Think i ordered some fries and a burger. They have all sorts of food and boose here this place is awesome. My first time here, but id drink at the wine bars out here and get shitfaced in the city lol. Was a nice crowd few months ago, where we could dine in. Staff are cool, Bartenders are so customer friendly. I am not surprised, ill be back here in the Summer.",5 star rating,Michael K.
11/16/2020,"Oxnard, CA","Perfect family atmosphere! My husband and my son's meals were good they both loved it, I was not to fond of my own which is the only reason for the 4 stars.Husband got chicken strips and fries, son got burger and fries both came out hot and both were good. I got the pesto chicken sandwich and onion rings and I was not fond of either, the onion rings were watery and pesto was too much pesto and the mozzarella cheese wasn't melted. Other than that, the atmosphere was great, very kid and family friendly.IT was just COLD but they accommodated with the heat lamp. The drinks and cocktails were delicious and the customer service was great. They get busy fast and the ETA on waiting for a table was told 45 minutes but within 30 minutes we were seated. Definitely a good end to a day in Solvang and plan to come back again.",4 star rating,Arlene E.

5/13/2021,"Huntington Beach, CA","I went there yesterday (5/12/21) for beer and food.  Their beer was mediocre and so was the food.  I tried their IPA and brown ale.  The IPA was not very hoppy and had a weird after taste.  The brown ale was insipid lacking flavor.  But what annoyed me the most was on my order for 2 people they automatically added an 18% tip which was not apparent unless you closely analyze the bill and the bill has a big space for more tip, so I ended up tipping over 30%!  I didn't realize this until later.  As I had to go order my food and drink at the bar, no waiter service, that was exorbitant.",3 star rating,Alan B.
9/25/2020,"Fresno, CA","Came here for take out after getting to town late Friday night Sept 18, 20. They had just reopened after being closed for months and it was a mess. They hadn't quite got back into the swing of things yet. Despite that the staff they took our order was friendly and helpful. Food took forever to get and they forgot to package one item with our order so had to wait longer. The food itself was okay. Nothing special. I think with time they will figure things out again and things will improve. But I'd give it a little time before visiting. The outdoor area is really nice and the location is good.",3 star rating,Christina C.

1/21/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","I've been to Solvang many times over the years. I know that during the breakfast hour and the lunch hour it gets super busy and restaurants you'll be stuck waiting for some time. However, just to our luck we tried this spot out and got a seat right out front in their beautiful set up. Now, they don't have a huge selection on food. This is a brewery. What we did end up choosing was the salad and wings. Both portions were huge and definitely filled us up for lunch. Due to the pandemic there's no seating inside but from my walk the bathroom it looked pretty cool. Food came out quick and the staff was helpful in recommending items of the menu. Dog friendly.",4 star rating,Dennis C.
9/23/2020,"Henderson, NV","This place is so cute. In a town full of wine, this brewery is a haven for the beer lover. There is plenty of outside seating and space; they've done a really good job there. The beer was not bad, although a little hard to find. We couldn't find the beer menu and we weren't looking to eat, but because of COVID you have to order food and they make you order an entree...it was huge. No bueno. If I had been hungry the beet salad would've been delicious. We also asked for waters which we never received. The town and the ambiance can't be beat. Cheers",4 star rating,SAnne H.
2/15/2020,"Ventura, CA","I had higher hopes for this spot. We got in at a good time because when we left on a Saturday at 2:00, there was a 25-30min wait. My menu was missing a few pages, and there was a discrepancy with the beer list. The beer wasn't the best, I was not a fan of the Valhalla ipa or the other rotating double ipa they had. My girlfriend enjoyed their blonde ale. The food was really good, the wings were a little dry but still had good flavor. The blue cheese burger with bacon was amazing. The blue cheese was slightly melted which always adds to the bite.Giving it 3/5 because the beer wasn't that good and it was fairly pricey, $16.95 for a burger with a few fries; I won't be coming back. Bill was $60 for 3 beers, buffalo wings and a burger, too much in my opinion.",3 star rating,Anthony C.

3/11/2021,"Solvang, CA","My fiancé and I are typically very busy and it's really hard to find good food to go at reasonable prices in Solvang and Santa Ynez.  Both long time Valley residents. As some reviewers stated the waiters and servers in the past had been very slow, etc.  We had run into the same problem several years ago so today figured we'd give it another shot.Their taproom burgers with sides had always been consistently good and priced right at $12.95+ tax.  So we went on the safe side and ordered two to go.Called in and Ryan answered the phone.  Hoped it was the same Ryan who worked as a bartender there for years.  Indeed it was and his customer skills whether you're a local or visitor... busy or not have always been great.  Ordered 2 Taproom Burger's cooked medium with sautéed onions.  It comes with thick cut bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato's, red onions, nice bun and choices for sides.  We choose the fries which are nicely seasoned.  Also sauce is probably thousand island which neither of us like.  Asked to put that on the side...aka dry.  They did that and also included ranch and ketchup on the side.  FYI: If they have their aioli mayonnaise definitely recommend that as it adds another layer of flavor to a very good bacon cheeseburger.  We ended up using mayonnaise at home as the burgers, bacon, sautéed onions, etc were that good.  So were the tomatoes flavorful and there weren't any hard cores in the middle as typical of many tourist and fast food restaurants.Called order in and said I can be there in 20 min.  Perfect, they'll be ready when you get here.  We know sautéed onions take far longer than grilled onions to cook.  No problem.Arrived 20 minutes later.  Cold outside and it was just beginning to rain.  Thank goodness the food was fresh, hot and ready on time exactly to order.  Made certain to tip well as we normally do for excellent service as most people in the food and service industry work minimal wages and earn their living on tips.  That's not the fault of owners paying huge overhead costs in Solvang to operate a business and providing higher value in quality of food relative to price.   My fiancé and I both noticed right away the quality relative to price.  Buns were excellent.  Burgers as promised flavorful 1/2 lb. angus beef patties and tasted fresh not frozen cooked medium as requested.  Thick cut bacon cooked to perfection and great flavor.  Think the cheese is cheddar.  Everything about this burger was great for the price and nothing greasy.It came with a nice portion of hot seasoned fries nice and crispy also flavorful.  Home run Solvang Brewing Company!  We'll be back.We love to support local businesses in the Valley but when overpriced and lower quality in relation to fast food in Buellton or cooking at home?  We also reside in Santa Barbara and there are also some great food to value restaurants that cater to local steady repeat business and tourist spikes.",5 star rating,Arthur T.
12/6/2020,"Mission Bay, San Francisco, CA","Food is decent quality, pretty standard bar fare. The only problem i had is that the mashed potatoes were clearly the boxed flake stuff... the real thing isn't tough to make and super inexpensive, and its a Dutch town for crying out loud! To the management: your servers have sections twice as large as they should. 8 two-tops plus 2 or 3 large parties is insanity. If all they had were drink orders I could maybe see giving them sections that big, but not for food service. Our waitress gave us the best service she could given how badly you set her up for failure. All the floor manager did was sometimes help setup tables... maybe try helping your overwhelmed servers and touch tables to make sure everything is good with your customers. If you doubled your wait staff and had more busers you would have way higher turnaround on your tables, making you more money, your servers would make more tips, and most importantly you would have happier customers. Everybody wins when you staff properly.",3 star rating,Joe J.

4/3/2021,"San Fernando, CA","They made a mistake on the order and instead of resolving the mistake they stated I would have to go into line, bring it up with the manager and then possibly be able to get the order fixed.  What is the point of customer service if the business insist that the customer is incorrect.

11/27/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Food was good but the service sucked. I was seated And then it took a while for the server to common take my order.. I had to flag her down. One young lady brought me my food put it down and walked away and didn't ask if I needed anything. I had to get it from my seat and walk over to where they were and ask for dressing for my salad. They brought me vinegar and walked away....  I wanted a   vinegarette dressing. I had to get it from my seat go over to where the girls were again and ask for what I wanted. I asked the manager to bring me boxes to go... he brought them. I had an order to go The waitress brought  That to me... Then I asked for bag to put these 3 boxes in. I stopped at the bar on the way out and talk to the manager... I told him that No one ever came to my table to ask me if I needed anything no 1 ever came to refill my water.... I had to get up 3 times for my table to get the things I needed. His answer was,I'm sorry about that I guess they were real busy. WHAT? I don't know... But all this seems to be basic... I was there for 2 hours And that was only because The service was horrible. And by the way the manager  answered me,  This sounds like the norm and it sounds like it's acceptable.Too bad...Nice establishment and good food but when the customer service stinks, it just makes it an overall bad experience.",1 star rating,"Desiree Mier, Realtor ®."

When I called the girl said they weren't busy and tonight would be a good night to come. When we got there they told us they don't allow alcohol purchases without an entree purchase, which was already frustrating, but we figured we'd come anyway. Once we were seated, we saw it wasn't busy and were told our server would be right with us. It took her a little over 15min just to come over and introduce herself, she passed our table several times and didn't even say she'd be right with us. Once she finally came over, I asked her to check the ingredients on something (because I have an allergy) and it took her 20 min to come back.

It was at least 20 minutes until he came back and said that it was more soggy than it should have been. Would we like a replacement?  After 20 minutes waiting, No. he should have taken it off the bill but didn't. Also, they had an elderly man waiting for a seat and was having a major medical problem, heat related. My husband told the waitress to get him some water. They didn't even notice. He got so bad he passed out in front of the check in stand and my husband rushed over to him and gave him medical aid. Told them to call 911 and waited for the paramedics to take over.

As we walked in, the smell of old dive bar hits you in the face ... in a good way I guess. It's dark and old and probably hasn't been updated since before I was born but that's what gives it its charm.  The place was packed and there was both Football (preseason) and Baseball on the TVs. The bar area was full as were all of the high tables.  We were seated in a booth near the door but away from the heat so I was happy.  I couldn't help but notice the duct tape on the seats of the booth.  All part of the charm right?Our server was great.  Very attentive the entire time we were there. My dad and brother ordered beers (Thank you Yelp for the discount after checking in) and mom and I stuck with ice water.  Here's what we ordered to eat:Brewers Soft Pretzel with Beer Cheese and Mustard Dippy Sauces - This is honestly what made us walk in here.  I was craving a soft pretzel and these didn't disappoint.  For $10 you get 3 good size SOFT warm pretzels with two yummy dippy sauces. I enjoyed mixing them together.  We got two orders of these and inhaled them both. Tri Tip Dip - This was a last minute order since the pretzels went down so quickly and this too didn't disappoint.  We cut it into 4 pieces and it was plenty for the 4 of us, especially since it came with fries. The meat was tender and flavorful and the AuJu was tasty. I could have eaten this all by myself. We left content and ready to wine taste! If we're in the area again, I'll absolutly come back.",4 star rating,Christie B.

We ordered two beers, soft pretzel, chicken wings and a bowl of clam chowder.We sat on the patio to get fresh air and a couple at an Adjoining table were vaping. There is clearly a designated-smoking area located in their parking lot, about 25 feet from the patio area. The staff were smoking in the smoking area, so I know they are aware that it exists. State of California law states you can not smoke or vape within 25 feet of a restaurant/bar's outdoor dining area. The couple vaping were doing so right in front of at least 5 staff members, including directly in front of our waitress while talking to her.The whole vibe of the place was trashy and ""truck stop"". It stands out in Solvang for all the wrong reasons.",2 star rating,sonny d.

1/19/2020,"West Hollywood, CA","Solvang is a hive of tourist activity and usually tourists are douchey, demanding and oblivious to anything that does not involve the world revolving around them. Call it vacationitus or just self importance when spending one's hard earned time and money on an experience which is supposed to deliver joy and relaxation vs. the stresses left behind at a job. Deliver me from stress Solvang Brewery did not ... in fact, I'd gladly have taken a workplace cafeteria over this spot.I'm not taking off stars because this place was crowded, and it was crowded, as everything in Solvang was. I'm rating one star because to begin with this place is below average at best ... and the staff's attitude all around was abysmal and rude. The hostess looked as if she wanted to punch anyone in the face who asked her a question ... she sighed when people walked in the door ... rolled her eyes when they asked the wait time ... and snapped at people when they agreed to be put on the list.We were told (rudely) that there was a 40 minute to an hour wait. We said that we would have a drink (or three) at the bar while we waited and asked if they announce in the bar when tables were ready as it was two or three rooms over from the stand. Apparently that was a dumb question because with an eye roll and utter disbelief she just nodded her head. I wanted to quote the Uncle Buck line and ask if she was feeling upset because somebody dropped a house on her sister. (Wicked witch of the West reference.)In the bar there was a band playing and it was so loud that you couldn't hear someone talking a foot away from you. Apparently, everyone had the same idea because it was pandemonium at the bar. They had 2 bartenders working and 50+ people waiting for drinks. After watching groups of girls push past the rest of the crowd and getting served by the male bartenders for 20 minutes, I finally got the attention of the bar tender. I ordered 3 drinks ($15 for a glass of house wine!!!) and asked for a taste of one of the beers before I committed to it ... pretty standard at a craft brew place. The guy came over and put the tiny taster glass down and as I took a sip, he left and went to the other side and as they say in Goodfellas ... I was put on the pay no mind list. He didn't come back, so no drink for me! (And he charged me $3 for the taste on the receipt!! The full glass about 16x bigger was $7!) Did he think my intent was to drink a thimble full of beer?We finally were seated at a high top table nexy to the hostess stand vs. in the other room with the fireplace. Lucky us, bitchy hostess was doubling as our waitress. She said they were very busy and switching to their late night menu an hour early. Apparently all we were allowed to get were one of 5 shitty sounding pizzas. We ordered and watched other tables get seated after and order from the menu. It was clear that this dummy just didn't want to do the work of menus, etc. and made us order pizza. Not sure anything would have been better off the menu but would have been nice to have more than one option, like everyone with a different waitress.Our pizzas came out and honestly, we would have rather gone to Dominoes down the street. Worst pizza ever. They were cardboard crusts (clearly premade and frozen) sloppily made with almost no cheese and toppings that looked like a Red Baron frozen grocery store pizza. Each pizza cost us $15-$18. The wine was $12-$16 per glass and soapy, shitty tasting beer was how everyone described their brew. Maybe the glasses weren't rinsed after washing?To recap ... shitty attitude ... shitty service ... shitty beer ... shitty pizza ... shitty prices ... crowded/shitty atmosphere next to the kitchen doors. Overall experience: Shitty x 6.I get that Solvang is a busy town where everything shuts oddly early. Every restaurant is closed by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. so they treat you like you are lucky they will even serve you at p.m. and technically they can get away with it because there are literally no other options in Solvang past 9 p.m. Maybe if I was coming here to drink, my rating would be different. But if I'm going to drop $200 on 5 cardboard pizzas and a round or two of gross beer and overpriced wine while being treated like the turd in the punch bowl ... I'd literally prefer to go to Dominos next time.Go anywhere but here for lunch or dinner.",1 star rating,Adam B.

We attempted to sit in the dining area with the tables but were told they were all reserved.Odd because as we were quickly downing our pints at the bar, random people walked in and were seated at various tables in the dining section.The bartender was caked in make up and hiding behind fake lashes long enough to look like they were bought as a joke. Reject burlesque would be the most accurate description of what was shelling out the beers with very messy pours dripping all over the counter.The patrons were a curious lot that I would not have expected in Solvang. I visit Solang regularly and I've never been in here before, and after this visit, I never will again.Go to the Good Life. Hell, go to the Back Room. Not here.

3/15/2020,"Burbank, CA","On a Friday night in March (2020), my family and I ate outside here on a brisk, cool evening.  Because we had our little doggie with us, we sat outside in their front seating area.  So already, you know this place is accommodating and dog-friendly.I loved their kids' cheeseburger (my son ordered it, I didn't).  Also, the fish tacos were ""on pointe"" -- which is what I ordered.Once again, I have to mention that my family and I have been here before; and I have to admit, the food was great four years ago as it was two weekends ago.  Some things never change.if you're in Solvang, give this place a try.  You won't regret it.P.S. On a side note, my husband and I went here again for drinks on the following Saturday evening.  We ordered the sausage sampler, just to ""tide us over"" for dinner.  I have to say, their Cape Codders are subtly, yet simply S-T-R-O-N-G. . . just the way I like it (smile).",5 star rating,Patricia N.
1/26/2020,"San Antonio, TX","Although the beer selection is pretty nice and it's a good variety, the service at the restaurant was just ok. We sat down to eat and order and waited quite a while to get our food (it wasn't too busy and there were empty tables here and there. We had a group of 4 at our table, and somehow the group of 5-6 next to us got their food first and they got here after we did.The food was ok, nothing amazing about it. The service from our server was almost non-existent. And the food took forever to get. So the reasons I'm giving them 2 stars are: 1. Because the beer is pretty good and they do have a good selectIon. 2. They're one of the only few places that are open pretty late. So if you're visiting, either go out and eat before other restaurants close, or come here and have a good beer and wait a while for your food",2 star rating,Jesus H.

Staff was friendly upon arrival and we sat outside as for a Thursday night they were not very busy. Beer was tasty. I forget what we tried but they had a decent selection. That being said we wanted to get into the Danish spirit of the town so we had to try their sausage platter. Three different sausages with assorted cheese and a soft pretzel. Following our appetizer we tried some tasty burgers. Portions are of good size and food is good quality. Although the food is nothing to write home about it hits the spot and tastes good.

2/16/2019,"Chatsworth, CA","I'm basing my review on the beer in general since I wasn't here to eat. The building itself looks great, it's a busy restaurant with lots of indoor & outdoor seating, they also have a full bar so it's not just beer only like most breweries. I discovered Solvang Brewing back in 2018 at the Buellton beer & had it bookmarked ever since then to check out.I don't think anything is wrong with the beer, but nothing really stood out to me. Everything was kind of average, I did enjoy their Double IPA, but then again I've never really met a DIPA that I didn't like. If I was in the area again I'd definitely come back just to try some of the food & give the beer another shot.",3 star rating,Tony H.

10/23/2020,"Modesto, CA","Do yourself a favor and stop at a gas station for a hot dog or some sushi instead of eating here. My family of 4 ordered a soft pretzel for an appetizer, a fish & chips, 2 personal pizzas and a tri-tip French dip sandwich. We ordered 2 Steins of beer and and a harvest Bloody Mary. I immediately sent back the $14 Bloody Mary because the bacon was so over cooked that it fell apart when you tried to lift it out of the glass and it tasted like watered down tomato juice. The beers were good. Our pretzel came out at the exact time as our meal but it was a tasty pretzel (it was 3 decent sized baguette  looking pretzels). Both pizzas were frozen pizzas that had some toppings neatly placed on top. I have never had a frozen pizza taste as bad as these pizzas. The fish & chips came with 2 pieces of fish on a bed of soggy, dripping with oil French fries that were awful. My daughter took 2 bites of her sandwich and left the rest. I had a word with the manager about how terrible the food was and her response was, ""because you ate some of the food (I didn't even eat a full piece of my pizza), I can't take the meals off of your tab, but I can give you a discount"". Mind you, we were there for about an hour and a half from start to finish and 80% of our food was left on our plates.  We all tried each other's food and we all felt the same about it. They took off $6.00 from our tab. We didn't look at reviews for this place until AFTER we had such a terrible experience. Lesson learned. I did not scream and make a scene.  I was honest and felt they needed to know. Gordon Ramsey would be challenged with this place.",1 star rating,Jamie D.

11/7/2020,"Huntington Beach, CA","As a manager in the food industry myself, I will say this:There are flaws in their operations. Their menu is not up on their website, and when you get there, you will be rushed. They want to get through the line regardless of whether they get your order correct or not, and then point their finger at you for their mistake. Their manager Brandon is completely unprofessional and did not de-escalate the situation. Zero empathy skills. He claims to want to take care of his customers, but all he really wants to do is knock out the line. Hire people and have them actually wait on your customers. Or if you can't afford to, take the time with each customer to make sure they are taken care of.Good luck with your business.",1 star rating,Sarah B.
12/29/2018,"Westlake Village, CA","Solvang Brewing Company is A-OK. Plus one star for being one of the few places open late for drinks in the heart of Solvang. While our party didn't try any of their food, we enjoyed the chill atmosphere and refreshing beers. They have quite a few options here sure to satisfy. Their variety ranges anywhere from Raspberry Wheat to Stout. I settled on the Valhalla IPA, which did not disappoint.For those that don't know, Solvang Brewing Company was established in 2010 as a Northern European-style Brew Pub. Their beers are brewed on-site, and all ages are welcome. The place itself is pretty big, with plenty of space to accommodate larger groups. You'll know you've found it when you see the large windmill outside. It is pretty epic.Service during our stay was fairly attentive. Our waitress came and checked in on us pretty frequently, which was nice. With ~32 ounce mugs on the menu, luckily we didn't require many refills. If you find yourself in Solvang, I'd definitely recommend stopping in for some drinks. I can't speak to the food, but they do have a decent dinner menu.

This was our first stop off in Solvang and we were starving! They had a nice selection of beers and the ambiance was that of a neat pub maybe somewhere in Europe, maybe. However, we weren't so impressed by the food etc. They may have been understaffed so I'd hate to bash, but maybe during a holiday week you should have just a few more people on board. It took almost an hour from when we sat down to get our food, same for everyone else around us. I wouldn't have minded if we didn't have a hotel to check into and clean up for the night! This place was pretty packed, seemed to be quite popular! The food was pricy, as is anywhere in Solvang! I would say their sausage sampler and fish and chips were the best! Fried zucchini meh, not too much flavor but loved the panko on there! Wings were good but not worth the mula we spent. It's a cool stop off but maybe for a quick drink, not to eat!

I went again on wednesday (09/16) and I've never had service that bad. Our server was Aubrey. My friend and I arrived and were seated and told our server would be with us in a few minutes. when she made it over to us we asked for water and she took our food order since we didn't know what drinks we wanted yet. Our table was very dark and even the server commented on how dark it was and said ""oh the umbrella is still up"" but didn't put it down after we said ""yeah it's really dark over here we can't see the menu very well"" all she said was ""you're young! I believe in you"" and just walked away. When she came back to get our drink order it had been 10 minutes. We still didn't have waters, so I asked again. She didn't come back to check on us at all until she brought our waters THIRTY-FOUR (34) minutes after we had asked the first time. I'm sorry, but it should never take THAT long to get waters....  We got our food 1-2 minutes after getting our waters and drinks, which only goes to show that the kitchen is on top of their game! The server, not so much ... I had asked for a side of sour cream and it didn't come with our food. she never came back to check on us so I couldn't ask her for it.

Here is an opportunity!)We checked into our lovely Scandinavian hotel at 7 pm. January. Restaurants said to be open on Yelp we're closed, one with a sign ""Closed for Deep Cleaning!""The brewery was busy. It is pretty large...and understaffed. Hostess says 20 minutes (though a whole section of empty table exists). Ok, we get a drink at the bar. Bar is buzzing. Meet a nice local guy. Vibe is good. Beers are good.Hostess calls my phone as table is ready. Overworked server is nice but too busy. As other Yelpers state, they say they will honor $1 off for Yelp check in, then do not!Zucchini appetizer very good. They are out of the schnitzel, one of the specialties...and other mains. We settle on French onion soup, a deep good broth but not hot enough and fish tacos...plentiful and decent.Barely see server again. I literally have to walk around to find him to get check.Overall, this place has all the potential to be great. Management has no real night competition so can run it understaffed. Food has potential, but needs to be hot enough.Young chefs, there are some vacant shops in town. This is a cool tourist town in a great wine region.

After another 30 minutes went by, we asked if we could order and we were told to go to the bar and order, because she's overbooked and had too many tables to take care of. The bar was completely sold out of IPAs, which is an interesting problem for a brewery to have, sort of like a steak house running out of steak. The service here is absolutely terrible and on par with something you'd see at a fast food restaurant. There are a lot of other good options in the area, so this place will probably be on the bottom of our list in the future.",3 star rating,Matt M.
8/10/2018,"Norwalk, CA","Would love to give SBC 4 stars because the food was delicious and the location is so cute, but our food for 5 people took 1 hour to arrive. 1 hour for burgers, wings and beer. NOT COOL. It was even more annoying since we came to Solvang on a tour bus and we were on a time crunch, which we did explain to our waiter, but they didn't bother to come and check on us or offer any sort of consolation regarding the wait, which is also a let down. If by any chance I am again in the area and not short on time, I MAY visit again.",3 star rating,Vanessa A.

The pizza wasn't awful but it also wasn't hot and quickly congealed despite the oppressive heat (we were  seated outside). We left several slices behind. No happy hour, either. But what really rankled was the group of 20somethings gathered out front on restaurant property talking, smoking, and swearing loudly the entire time - as at least two employees came out to join them rather than ask them to quiet down or leave.

Several minutes later the original person shows up & takes our order!   Finally.  It took several more minutes to finally get our food. By now we have been there about 25 minutes.

My husband got the tri tip French dip sandwich and they don't season the meat we had to keep adding ingredients to make it taste like something.

3/2/2021,"San Rafael, CA","Beer Good.  Service HORRIBLE.  Wow hands down the worst service (not to be confused with rude) I think I have experienced -OR, maybe, to be fair, in the top 3.  Congratulations. The Covid excuse is just that.  You have been at it a year.  This wasn't a Covid experience.  Again I ask, Where is the management or leadership?  It's your fault!  Not the poor guy left alone at the bar to take orders and run dishes.  Also - Um, if you are going to add an 18% tip on every order maybe the classy thing is to take ""additional tip"" off the ticket.  How much do you really expect people to tip? 25% 30% What is the limit?  Maybe pay your staff a workable wage instead of lump this on your customers to take care of with NO OPTION.  So getting beer (walking up) for me took 30 minutes with only one other person ahead of us.  Then the bar guy had to run food while the gal before us had to wait about 20 minutes for 2 empty glasses.  Her husband already got a pitcher of beer -but no glasses!  We ordered two beers and were told had to order food even though our table had already ordered a bunch of food, but Ok, it's a version of the state or county rules - sooooo I order the truffles fries. Over an hour and a half later AND after telling a staff person no fries.  No fries that got a tip (presumably for ""good service.""  We saw 3 total staff. 1 bar tender, 1 cook, 1 busboy all night.  So you ask why didn't you go and have them charge off the fries - Because it was already a nightmare and we wanted to RUN.  Like you should RUN FROM THIS PLACE or be prepared for this mess to happen to you.",1 star rating,R P.

The artichoke appetizer was disappointing at $12, one artichoke sliced in half with lemon wedges and aioli, really? Beer came to the table warm and had citrus seeds in the bottom of one glass.

3/26/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","I actually had much lower expectations for this place based on it looking more of a tourist trap restaurant than a legitimate place making good food. You know what I'm talking about. The places on the Vegas strip, nearly every place in Miami, time square restaurants. Just poor quality food banking on tourists being desperate to eat. Granted I've eaten here once, as a tourist. I am often at the chumash casino for work (no not gambling and calling it work, lol) and have always wanted to but never until the last trip venture to Solvang. I made he mistake of going around 7 to eat dinner the town becomes a ghost town so not a whole lot of options based on my little walking the streets to look around. I decided on here rather than the cafe next door and the fancier place across the street based on price and menu options. I didn't have a craving for anything in particular but the other two places I had to piece things together to make a meal I wanted and this had a meal I actually wanted to eat. As soon as I saw pastrami sandwich and fish and chips I was hooked on choosing this place. Food was good. Nothing amazing but would def eat here again. I ended up with the pastrami cause it looked like a lot of food with the fish and chips when the other table ordered it. Service was ok. Not the fastest to be acknowledged when i walked in. Server was ok not bad but could have been more attentive to refilling my drink, not taking forever to bring check or collect it. Like I said the place was a ghost town so it wasn't like they were packed. There was two other tables where I was sitting and my server had 2/3 of the tables so could have stepped it up.",4 star rating,Briana V.

But what stole the show, other than the burger: The Electric Lavender Lemonade.Some may claim the lavender was overpowering, and at 1st taste, I might agree... It was like they added vodka to a lavender essential oil... Omg! This drink was sooo ""lavendery"", I felt calmed and inebriated by the second sip.

11/14/2019,"San Rafael, CA","Every visit to Solvang requires at least one visit here for good food and good craft beer. But no beer this time! The place was moderately busy for a weeknight in November, but I was seated quickly in the bar area (you can chose there or in the dining room - this has TVs and more to keep my attention!). Ordered an iced tea for drinks, and it arrived poured in a glass and the rest in a half carafe - very nice! Too bad other places don't do this, saves on asking (waiting for . . . ) refills. I ordered the Panko Crusted Fried Zucchini Planks ($8.95) and the Wedge Salad (wedged hearts of romaine, Danish bleu cheese crumbles, tomatoes, chopped pepper bacon, red onions, herbed croutons and house made creamy bleu cheese dressing), but I held the bacon ($12.95). The food arrived in good time, the salad being my main course (and already cold!) so I set it aside to work on the appetizer zucchini planks. These were cut in half, and served with Ranch and bleu cheese dipping sauces. These were, sad to say, VERY disappointing! I would have not known what these were, as there was VERY LITTLE zucchini. The panko covering was good, but at no time did I taste zucchini - it was like taking an onion ring and pulling out the onion - all that's left is the breaded shell. The pictures show this, and the ONE that could be seen to have a zucchini was so thin, it still was not tasting of zucchini. I am disappointed, and hope someone corrects this - for $9, a waste of money and not the treat I had. Moving on to the main course (my salad), this is almost exactly like the one I had 8 months ago - very good, fresh and crisp lettuce, lots of bleu cheese crumbles and I added extra dressing, which was perfect for me. Love the salad. The service here is very good, with Michelle, my server, checking in and being friendly while efficiently handling all her tables (thanks again!) and a couple of guys helping as well, running dishes from the kitchen and clearing dishes. I still enjoy the ambience in this place (when it's not TOO crowded - just gets too noisy), the decor is great and even the bar is fun to watch - especially the people! I'll be back, and may try the dill pickle planks again, but until then I have to take away a star - however, I am hopeful!",4 star rating,Mark K.

1/8/2018,"Lake Forest, CA","In my quest for an actual bloody Mary, not one made with some rice wine or other non-spirit fake, I ended up at the Solvang Brewery, and I'm glad I did. Every other ""cocktail lounge"" I went to in Solvang ended up being a wine bar, none with licenses to sell the hard stuff, despite the Yelp category stating otherwise. Their bloody Mary is just the ridiculous monstrosity I was hoping for, more of a meal than a cocktail, and simply delicious all around, with or without the ""salad"" and bacon that adorned it. Three skewered olives, cucumber slices, carrot, bell pepper, celery stalk, and two big, thick pieces of black peppery bacon. The only thing missing was, perhaps, a colossal boiled shrimp, and maybe an oyster.  While a truly outstanding version of a bloody Mary, my wife did say that she saw a very weak pour on the vodka from the bartender. I didn't notice with all the spice, but it was still very good.The ambience is very cool with old vinyl booths, stickers all over the tables, dark, dark reds and woods, and a sunken bar so the bartender is a bit lower. Old and varied German beer steins adorn one shelf, and various vintage looking signs are everywhere, some clearly not really vintage...  Seating inside the bar is visually appealing, an old bar feel, but the barrel tables out front are equally nice, and probably where I would choose to sit next time, just for the variety.Service comes with a quick seating by the hostess, and a slower form of attention from the waiter. Ours was quick enough, but once served we were pretty much ignored. A table that sat just behind us were seated quickly, as we were, but after several minutes were never approached, and after some audible complaining, got up and left the restaurant.  If you want a drink in Solvang, a real drink, or a craft beer, this is a go to place.",4 star rating,Ted S.
12/26/2018,"San Mateo, CA","I'm not too familiar with Danish food, but I'm starting to think that it's a lot of sausage and carbs (which I'm not complaining about). Since we were in Solvang, we wanted Danish food and this restaurant has the closest thing we could find to it. We got:- Danish Reuben: A sandwich with tons of pastrami. The pastrami was really good and so was the rye bread. The dressing helped it so it wasn't dry and all together it was a tasty sandwich.- Danish Meatballs: The meatballs were tender and the gravy had lots of flavor. We got the mashed potatoes as well and they were soft and buttery.- Jager Snitchel: This is a large piece of thinly pounded pork that's battered and fried with bacon gravy on top. I loved how crispy the breading was and the the pork was actually still really juicy. The gravy was good as well, but you can just taste the overall unhealthiness of this meal. - SBC Sausage Trio: There were 3 different types of sausages that each had its own flavor. We got plain potatoes with it which were good because everything else came with some much fat and flavor. The pretzel with cheese was probably one of my favorite parts as I love melted cheese.All the dishes came with pickled red cabbage as well which was actually really good as it has a nice vinegar-y tang, but it's too much when you have some on all 4 dishes.Overall, it was a very tasty Danish meat with lots of variety of meats and carbs.",4 star rating,Sophia Y.

We were there on monday December 23, 2019 in the evening and the hostess was so snappy and rude we asked if anything was available and she said: ""No"". She said nothing else. Nothing available is fine- but a little more response would be ok‍  Then we went to the bar and turns out the woman working the bar was just as bad I asked if she could recommend a lighter beer for me, and she said "" we only have our own brew"". I was like Ok, does this mean there aren't any lighter beers.. or..?She did not answer.I have no idea why they are so grumpy and angry, maybe they hate tourists, but why work in a brewery in Solvang if that is the case..? Or maybe they hate their job, or themselves. I have no idea, but I do know I will tell anyone I know to not go there. I would never go there again.

We could have gotten a full size pint of our favorite, but it was a bit early and we had more on our agenda that day.. perhaps next time.The bar has kind of an Irish pub feel to it; kind of dark but traditional too.

The food is pretty average, and the service is decent. Given that this place is a brewery I was hoping to drink some pretty decent beer. I was extremely disappointed. I would definitely pass on their brews and just stick to what you know. This place is fine for hanging out in the evening when nothing else is open. Wish the live music was more upbeat.",3 star rating,Samuel G.

10/18/2019,"Ventura, CA","Tried this place for the first time on a Thursday night.  They were busy on Thursday, a good sign.  The waitress was friendly and did a good job despite having what would normally be too many tables assigned to her.  We started with the zucchini appetizer and it was the best I have had.  Turns out the zucchini is fresh from the garden, simply outstanding. Then the tri-tip French Dip.  OK, it was possibly the best ever, even better than Houston's and Philippi.  If you doubt it, give it a try.  The bread, cheese and au jus was really good, but what really did it was the thinly sliced tri-tip which was so flavorful.  My wife and I split it and we were both stuffed.  I paired with a brown ale which was nice, but not great. I really wish we could get Tuborg in the US, that would pair nicely and go with the Danish town theme.  Why not 5 stars, the timely and good service seemed more like luck and super hard work of our server, than it was by planning. I also want to see if the quality of food is consistent on multiple visits.  If they are consistent on that French Dip, and other food items, it will be a huge winner.We went back today for lunch.  We got a beer flight, zucchini (again), and split the Santa Ynez Valley BBQ burger.  The beers varied and most likely everyone would find one they like.  All the wines are local.  The zucchini was just as good as last night.  Service was really good again with a team effort.  The burger was great, with the meat tasty and smokey, the bacon was perfect, crispy real onion rings, and a tangy BBQ sauce,Consistency and quality of food and service rates a 5 star review",5 star rating,Edward N.

That's the only positive thing I can say about this establishment. The waitress took close to an hour to  bring us our food.  Everyone in the party got their food at different times. The orders were wrong and they didn't give us any utensils. My wife had to get them herself. To make things worse, we were out in the COLD waiting for our server to bring us our food. Only 3 heaters for all customers to share. I had ordered a to go sandwich and asked for no cheese due to food allergies. When I arrived at my hotel room, I discover melted cheese in the sandwich after I specifically said my son was allergic! I had to walk all the way back to the restaurant to return it.

The ambience is somewhat rustic. There is a full bar and craft beer on tap. The manager, possibly the owner, was our server. He offered me a free beer, apparently just poured by mistake, which I found generous. My wife got the tri-tip sandwich and I ordered an individual marguerita pizza, both good. It took too long to get our food. I would give the service 2-3 stars, but the manager apologized, telling us that they were very understaffed that day.

7/5/2017,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA","Honestly I can't believe I had written a review for this yet, that's crazy. This is one of the best places that I've ever been to in my entire life. The first time we ever came was back in 2012, when my husband and I came to Solvang for the first time for our anniversary. We came during a Halloween party with amazing live 80s music from a local band, and everyone was much more festive than we were (which is CRAZY). It's probably the most crowded place in all of Solvang because it's so great--and I mean locals, nice people, so you don't feel claustrophobic at all. We are quite the introverts but we've never felt more welcomed at a place. We constantly come back just for the music, the amazing food, and the beers that they craft themselves right here. One time, they gave us a tour in the morning and how they brew it themselves. It's quite amazing! & my mother, who doesn't prefer tap at all, loved the raspberry recipe, that's their most popular. Also, the most local wine they have is also a dry white raspberry flavor & it's fun to have them both to compliment the able-skiver dessert (Solvang's favorite!)  The onion rings are to die for, if you love Irish pub food here you go. This is also a great place to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.I've heard that they have karaoke some nights, they also have a jukebox whenever there's not live music. When they do have live music, it's never too loud because of the noise ordinance. I could go on forever about this place, but it's probably best experienced. This is definitely a wonderful spot that is dear to my heart.",5 star rating,Amber R.

8/13/2019,"Alameda, CA","This place was okay. We first went by on Sat 8/10/19 to see if we could have a beer. The place has great reviews, so we were excited to try some of the brews. There's two entrances. One to the brewery and one to the restaurant. Both were open. We walked to the brew side and entered and were then told by a server that we entered the wrong way and needed to go to the restaurant to get a table. She directed us up front. As we were walking through, another server told us we had walked through the wrong entrance, and then another told us, and then another told us. It was uncomfortable. Then when we told the hostess we just wanted beer, she told us we would have to get a table, not the bar. Huh. We ended up leaving.The next day 8/11/19 we decided to try it again on our way out of town. We tries t ok enter through the restaurant side, as so many servers had directed us the day before, but there was piece of tape blocking it a s directed us to enter through the brew side. Huh. So we entered, were seated, and then the waiting game began. Service was slow as molasses. We ordered tacos, and waited about 45 minutes for them to arrive. At one point our server told us that there was a large party ahead of us and they'd have to serve all of them before they got to us. Then she came back on another occasion and told us that our food was the next to be out and we would be served next...We waited and waited and waited.Finally, the food arrived. Food was good. Not impressive. Just good. My carnitas street tacos were dripping with grease and at one point I even took a napkin to soak it up before I took a bite. 3 stars for the food, 0 for service.",3 star rating,Joy S.

Service was terrible. I'm not even sure who our server was. The kid working the front seemed like he hated his job or his mom was making him do it. He wasn't pleasant at all. After we sat down, we had more than enough to time to look at the menu, multiple times before anyone came over. I had the raspberry wheat beer and it was not great. I love a good raspberry beer and this is now at the bottom of my list. My BF has the IPA which wasn't terrible , it was better than the raspberry. Our food was meh. I had the French dip and apparently ended up with the fatty part of the meat cut. Dan had pulled pork and it was pretty good. Meat was tender and delicious.

It didn't look like a busy night; therefore, the service should have been, but it was not sadly. First off, my mom asked for lemon for her water. The waitress seriously forgot and thought it was a straw she asked. I see no similar of a ""straw"" & ""lemon.""Secondly, we ordered an appetizer. After 30+ minutes, still NOTHING. I see our waitress on the corner of my eye dealing with other peoples dinners while she should be dealing with our pretzel appetizers!Lastly, my fiancé ordered a wheat ale and he has already finished it! You should be eating food with alcohol; however, we have not received it at all yet! If something happens to him in a sick matter later, I know who we should be blaming.Customer service is EVERYTHING in any type of place that deals with people! The waitress did come out to tell us; however, she should've told us 10-20 minutes ago!!! This was the time she then asked if my fiancé wanted a refill!!As you can see, I gave this place a 3 star rating because I am a FIRM believer of customer service when I eat out and this place didn't meet my expectation at all!This will definitely be my first & last place to eat here!!",3 star rating,Jessica Ann A.

They also have beers (obvi) and a cocktail menu which was perfect. Our waiter, Carlos, was very nice and quick and the busser was really sweet too!

We pointed out that they were charging us for 3 when we only had 2 and that one of those was wrong. They agreed to fix the bill. However when the bill came back it was still wrong.

2/23/2019,"Fullerton, CA","One word review: GarbageAllow me to elaborate.  My wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening and it was a little busy, we put in our name and said it didn't matter if we sat in the restaurant or the tap room (probably our first mistake, since we wanted to eat). We got seated in the tap room (bar) less than 10 minutes later (nice). It was a little loud in there, but whatever, I can deal with that.We were promptly given menus, told about the ""busy the keg"" special, given waters and told Carlos would be our server and be by shortly. Carlos came by pretty quick, was pleasant enough and took our order for a couple of pints of their session IPA.Carlos quickly returned with our beers and took our dinner order, stating it'd be out quickly.Then we never saw Carlos again. I mean, we saw him...but it was in various other areas of the restaurant/bar - we never saw him at our table again.Almost an hour later, no food, no additional drinks, and no Carlos seemingly forthcoming, I left the cash for the two beers on the table and hit the road.Maybe the issue was the deep complexity of our dinner order...one cup of French onion soup, a dinner salad, a warm pretzel, and fried zucchini.  I probably expect too much.Beware...or better yet just stay away or maybe go into the bar just for a beer. The session was pretty tasty, but it's been a long time since I've had service this bad - I actually walked right past Carlos on my way out and didn't even get an acknowledgment.

We ended up getting two craft beers. I got the windmill Wheat, and I forgot which one my boyfriend got but it was much darker than mine. We also ordered a Carnitas Street Tacos to munch on because the fries were out. Tacos were pretty good, but their tortilla was too soft that it ripped right through and I had to eat everything separately. Chips were good as normal chips are.

We were helped greatly by a great bartender (I think his name was Ryan) who had a cool laid-back attitude but seemed to genuinely want us to have a good experience. While we waited at the bar to be called for a table, he advised us we could place our food order with him to get in line for the kitchen which he said was scrambling to catch up on orders.After placing our food order and having a couple drinks at the bar, we were granted a table outside. Even after we had left the bar, he kept checking on our drinks, even brought out our food, and was happy to attend to little things like if we needed extra condiments. We saw him more than our actual server. In fact, he turned what would've been a below-average experience into a pleasant one, and he did all this seemingly completely in-stride. He picked up their slack big time.Great ambiance and vibe. Outdoor seating at night was pleasant due to good space heating. The food did take a long time on this visit, but when it arrived it was very well received. Beers 4.5 out of 5 (props for the ""Silent Treatment"" DIPA).

My sister and I split the beets salad and the Danish meatballs. The salad was so good. Despite its boring look, I killed the plate. The kids don't like beets, but that only meant more for me. The meatballs was hands down the best thing I ate this weekend. I questioned the red cabbage being served with it because when I tasted it all I coulda taste was vinegar, but mixed with the mashed potatoes, gravy and meatballs.....my my my - what a perfect combo. I forced myself to finish the whole plate.Also worth noting - the chicken strips that the kids got was actually very good. Even the fries were delicious.

My coworkers beef stroganoff was surprisingly amazing. But the sausage trio was by far the table favorite. It comes with a variety of mustard's and sausages. But the best part of the sausage trio is it comes with pickled cabbage that is so delicious. The place has a good atmosphere definitely a bar/brewery. It's reasonably price and reasonably quick pretty good stop. Tipsy pro: there sometimes secret parking in their front area that a lot of people overlook. Tipsy con: no hard cider.,4 star rating,M M.

It met my standard of what a home brewed beer should be. We also got the sausage sampler and I really liked the variety of sausages and mustards they give you. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of sauerkraut though. Maybe thats just not their style of cuisine? Idk.

I can understand a longer wait for food but when it comes out cold, that's just unacceptable. The nachos were cold, cheese was burnt and hard and the meat was greasy. We didn't eat them. On the bright side the manager was nice and took them off the bill. Hard pass on this place for food.",1 star rating,James S.

Drinks were good but many beers were unavailable. Service was good. Jennifer our waitress was exceptional.  She was very nice and professional with very nice. We would come back again. Maybe sit outside next time. Four dinners, two beers, 2 French onion soups plus pretzels we spent about $106.  Oh before I forget, if you read the online menu it may have changed already.

12/17/2017,"Chicago, IL","Got into town late on a Friday night, and decided not to go straight to bed after we checked into our hotel. A block away, we found the Solvang Brewing Company was still open,  so we decided to drop in. The place was in full swing, with a live band playing classic rock and a local crowd getting a bit too drunk but having a good time. There was no cover, the house IPAs were great, and the bartenders were fast and friendly while keeping an eye out towards crowd control. We seemed to be the only out-of towners there, and the locals were very friendly, stopping by to say hello, introducing us around, giving us a list of favorite wineries to check out, and challenging us to a game of pool. We stayed a while. It's always fun to feel welcome in a new place. If you can handle some really wasted but friendly people, then a late night here is a fun time.If not, I would recommend coming here earlier in the evening before the crowd really gets going. It's nicely decorated in old Danish style, and the beers are great, so I bet it's got a nice beer hall ambience earlier in the night.",4 star rating,Justin R.
9/19/2020,"San Jose, CA","It is unfortunate that the atmosphere is so well thought out and the service and quality of food is so terrible. There were plenty of tables open when we arrived yet it still took over 15 minutes for server to even come over and welcome us. Appetizers did not come out in time and the entrees lacked seasoning and three of the four entrees were cold on arrival. Additional beer took another 20 mins to arrive. The manager was apologetic (we appreciated that and he did take a couple drinks off our bill) but the service still did not get better after that. I had to walk our bill back up there to get them to rung it up. They said they would bring it right over 12 mins later still no cards back. Another person in our group had to go over and ask for it. It is truly unfortunate that such a great environment is spoiled. Bad service, cold food, and the entire disappointment took over 3  hours to complete as we tried to have patience.

I like the sausages and a few of the sauces, especially the bread.

12/12/2017,"Pasadena, CA","Stopped by on Saturday night to grab a bite and watch our boys in blue play. We were surprisingly seated right away. We placed our order fairly quickly and received our food not to long after that.  We started with the fried zucchini ($8) which was pretty good minus that weird lemony ranch they provided. I was tempted to ask for ""normal"" ranch but thought if they had ""normal"" ranch then they would've just given that to me. Besides our server didn't give us the time of day. Literally we only saw him to place our order and to pay for the check. I had a burger which was huge and hardy with some really thick and juicy bacon. The fries were disappointing. It was as if they forgot to put salt on it. My husband had the beef stroganoff which was tasty. Overall, the food was pretty good, the ambiance was nice but the service was disappointing.

Both brought satisfaction to their taste budsThe Turkey BLT we ordered and shared was great for sharing since one half of the sandwich was pretty large. It was also delicious. The service was prompt and promising and was friendly as well.The gal forgot my $1 YELP check-in but I didnt hold it against her.

7/4/2018,"Newport Beach, CA","In the Solvang area this is probably one of the only places open late on a weekday, which is why I stopped by as soon as I arrived.To start, the beer is good. I tried the Windmill Wheat & Raspberry Wheat-- both were good (crafted for the Hefe or Blue Moon lovers). They serve about 12 different beer options all brewed on site.The food was good. My friend tried the Tap House Burger and loved it. They cook the meat to your liking, so that's great. I tried the nachos and those were a great vegetarian option. The food menu is limited after 10 p.m. and includes only appetizers and a couple burgers. The portions are large so definitely enough to share with a friend.As for the service, nothing special. Bartender takes your order and brings you your food. The staff is not friendly but they also not rude.Also, the vibe is what I least liked.

The overall feel of the bar is very European, especially if you sit outside with the windmills in the background; the inside reminded me of a British pub. I was here with some friends on a Saturday and the service was a little slow. But then again, it's Solvang so there's really no rush. The food was alright - it's you typical bar/pub food (Carnita nachos, pretzels, burgers, etc). They have cocktails but the beer is where it's at. Their beer selection is good and traditional.

Staff is nice.Came back here later that night with 3 more girls who got to Solvang late and wanted to grab a drink. As I said, it's the only thing in Solvang opened late.  We grabbed a drink and had to deal with a group of drunk guys at the table nearby who were a little annoying.  We then proceeded to the game room and played a game of pool, which was cool.  Overall a cool place to hang out, good drinks, decent food.

2/16/2020,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA","Such a terrible experience. We came at 11:45 on a Sunday and were told there would be a 25-30 minute wait for the patio (our friends had a dog so we had to sit outside). Just as a point of reference, they have 2 patio seating/dining areas but one is a ""non-service"" side. It's only there so people can sit at a table and wait for another table. This makes absolutely zero sense, especially on a busy Sunday on a holiday weekend. After waiting an hour, we were told that they were just waiting for a table to leave after paying their check. After another 5-10 minutes, we were finally seated. We then waited almost 10 more minutes for anyone to come to our table. No one even offered us water. Once our server finally showed up, I tried ordering a Bloody Mary but was told the bartender wasn't making bloody Mary's today. No explanation why. They clearly had all the ingredients, as I saw multiple micheladas going by, but someone just decided that on a Sunday at brunch/lunch, they weren't going to offer them (they are specifically on the cocktail list btw). We ordered our food along w our drinks, hoping to cut down our wait time. However, we waited over an hour to get any food. Our server consistently lied about our food, saying it was ""on its way"" or ""I just saw it being plated, it should he just another minute"". Once we finally got the food, our pizzas were all undercooked despite us ordering them well done, and the fries were cold. By the time we paid our check, we wasted 3 hours of our lives at this place when we could have been wine tasting or doing literally anything else. Don't waste your time here. There are way better restaurants with much better service.",1 star rating,Valerie M.

1/1/2020,"Brookdale, CA",Let me start off by saying we have had some great experiences here in the past and I am hoping this was a 1 off experience.  We have been coming to the brewery for the past 3 or so years.  This was always our go to spot to eat multiple times per trip.  This last experience was on 12/30/2019.  We were sat at a large table in the bar area without any silverware and our server who was very friendly informed us right off the bat that the kitchen was heavily backed up and to try to get our order in as soon as possible.  We understood as it was a holiday and gave our drink order and food order and asked if there was any way to get our kids chicken strips fired as he was cranky which they were able to do.  They have removed some regular dishes from the menu that we regularly get.  Drinks came out sporadically (still no silverware)and as I got up I saw our server taking tables at the complete other side of the restaurant and he was literally running back and forth between both sides.  We finally got all of our drinks and there was a longer blond hair in my fiancé's water.  Also there was thick lipstick on my fiancé's chard glass which our server caught before we had to say something.  Our food started coming out pretty quickly (still no silverware) but sporadically which was surprising because we had been told it was going to take a while.  This kind of rushed us through our meal as we normally like to do a few rounds of beers (which are great) and some apps (fried zucchini is excellent).  Also the French onion soup (which is normally great) was not baked at all and the cheese on top was basically raw) and the soup was like warm.  One of our party members has a dislike for garlic and their house made ranch has a lot in it (I love it) but we apologized and asked for some oil and vinegar which never made it to the table. When the last dishes got there they finally brought the silverware.  I know this may not seem like a 2 star experience but in comparison to our previous visits it seems like things have taken a turn.  We ended up changing our plans for New Years to the spot next door called succulent cafe.  We will definitely be returning to the brewery next year and give it another try.,2 star rating,Rob T.

He ordered this massive burger with beer battered onion rings (which he was still complimenting the next day). Hubby and I shared a sampler of 6 ipa's. Our server was super sweet! Wish I remembered her name but it was s the end of our trip and we were beat. She was so nice, even with me having to change kids order last min, then spilling a whole cup of water on the floor.

12/31/2017,"San Jose, CA","Great ambiance at this restaurant. Loved the taproom like setting! There was hardly any wait to be seated and we got ourselves a spacious booth. The restaurant was quite loud with one group really enjoying themselves laughing and screaming. I am not complaining as the loud music from the jukebox and their chit-chat kept the vibe energetic. They also have some games that you can enjoy.We ordered two drinks and I can't really remember their names. One of them was a pineapple flavored Margarita which was so good and the other one was okay. For the second drink, the description of the drink in their menu specified that they would use pineapple flavored vodka but they were out and instead gave pineapple chunks in a cup on the side! That was weird. We ordered the Brewer's Soft Baked Pretzels which are soft-baked European style pretzels served with their house-made ale fondue and stout mustard dip. This was delicious but the portions were huge and we felt full even before ordering the main dish. In the mains, had a vegetarian California Chipotle Ranch Burger swapping the Black Angus patty for a veggie patty and again the same one with a grilled chicken patty instead. On the sides, the Beer battered onion rings and natural cut fries were not that great. Man! These burgers are built for the GIANTS! So gigantic! By the time we finished it, we were tired.

We went to go look for the non-existent host and after 10 minutes decided to just order some beers at the bar until they came back to the host stand.

The pretzels were the star of the meal above the entrees. They were nice and hot and fluffy. Served with a tasty cheese sauce. The chicken was ok and mashed potatoes were pretty good.

They're not just doing a blonde & an IPA, they have those, but they're also doing Nitros, darks, reds, everything...So I recommend a flight - cool feature here - you pick your own tasters. Find what YOU like!Man, this menu is deep! Bar favorites like nachos and wings are knockouts! Really! Nachos can feed everyone you're with. Note, I did not give a number. It doesn't matter how many, because this thing is HUGE.Salads are giant; sharable.Tap Room Burg is really good. Bacon is crisp! Juicy. Big!You can't really go wrong here...Beers are good.

9/2/2019,"Santa Cruz, CA","I don't know where to even begin with this place. We came on a Sunday night and were seated fairly promptly but it was as soon as our orders were placed that this place started to go immediately downhill. While our waiter was friendly, he was barely attentive. I asked for a veggie pizza with no goat cheese and made it clear while doing so. As soon as our food came out 40 minutes later, I notice the no goat cheese request was disregarded. I have extreme sensitivities to goat cheese so while I wish I could've just kept it, I had to send it back. What I wasn't expecting was for this to take another hour. In that time my boyfriend was also waiting for a second beer that came out with my food, even though I'm sure it doesn't take that long to pour a beer (but what do I know). Our waiter comped us with a free beer which in my opinion was not adequate given the inconsideration of our time and money. To top off the horrendous experience that was dining at this brewery, my boyfriend left his credit card at the table and noticed as soon as we got back to our hotel 20 minutes later. He called the restaurant to make sure it was there and after a good 4-5 attempts to get a hold of them (at 8pm), no one answered the phone. We decide to walk back and see if he had better luck asking in person, and sure enough it was there. What we weren't expecting to see, however, was the host physically ignoring incoming phone calls and hanging up the phone every time somebody called. We were absolutely shocked to see this and I hope management does something about it.We will not be returning and urge others to pass on this place as well! You're probably better off ordering a Dominos pizza down the street and grabbing a few beers at Copenhagen Liquor anyways.",1 star rating,Mahsa N.

The sausage dinner platter was everything i ever wanted- sausage, sauerkraut, pretzels, and dips. The wait staff was kind of slow, not for lack of trying. It seems like there just wasn't a lot of them. I'd definitely come back!",4 star rating,Alexandra D.

I was just about to leave when somebody finally came. The servers were helpful and friendly after that.There was live entertainment and a full bar. Indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was amazing! The roll, meat and portion was very satisfying. It was recommended that I try the red ale as I don't like bitter beer, and it was delicious. The beers are brewed on site but beware they do not carry apple ales (what I originally wanted). Overall great place to eat in a cute little town.",4 star rating,Jenifer N.
10/5/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Went to the Brewing Company to have dinner and watch the Dodger Game. Great all around service...our server Michael was attentive, polite and accommodating. We asked to be seated where we could watch the game and he sat us right in front of the television and put the volume up so we could hear the game. Charlie the manager came by and we had a delicious shot with him to rally with the Dodgers. Awesome atmosphere. On to the food the pretzels were soft, just the right amount of salt and the dips were tasty. We had the hot wings they were great. My husband and I split the SYV Western Bacon Burger. The bacon was thick cut added to the burger. Burger...one of the best burgers we've had.Had the raspberry wheat refreshing and you could really taste the raspberries. My husband had their most popular beer flight and it did not disappoint.",4 star rating,Fabiola P.
7/29/2015,"Anaheim Hills, CA","We stopped in here twice on our trip - once for lunch, and once for drinks at the bar.Lunch - Seated right away, server was nice, but slow. We ordered the Ale House Sausage Sampler, which was fantastic. It came with a pork medisterpolse, beef bratwurst and chicken andouille. All of them were great! It was also served with a large pretzel that we both thought could have used more salt, and three dipping sauces - two mustards and a cheese fondue. We also decided to split their Danish Rueben. It was so good! Really great pastrami, red cabbage, swiss cheese and Russian Dressing. I highly recommend that sandwich!Later that night we had a 45 minute wait at the restaurant next door, so we came over here to kill some time at the bar. It was happy hour so a Bloody Mary and a Jack & Coke were only $14. The Bloody Mary was just okay, it really tasted like shrimp cocktail sauce. The bartender was nice, we didn't interact with him too much.It's also worth noting that seriously everything in this town closes early, so this is pretty much the only place to hang out at night - their website says they are open until 2 AM.",4 star rating,Randi B.

Had we not had her I would have given a 3star review. We ordered the sausage sampler plate. Came with three different sausage and three types of dipping sauce(two types of mustard and cheese fondue) with one long freshly baked pretzel bun. We really LOVED one of the sausage and the other two were ok. We got the wings  and it was just ok, kinda cold. Since we were pretty full off the appetizers we decided to order one order of Brewhouse Pastrami and that my friend was DELICIOUS. It came with a side of great fries as well.

Unfortunately half the staff looks or is acting like they're being tortured for showing up for their shift.  My fiance and I were there to drink beer and watch football and eventually eat, but the guy waiting on us in THE BAR AREA kept checking in on us. You think it's thoughtful, but every time he walks by and twice in 5 minutes is uncomfortable. We were planning on eating but decided to just leave cause we were obviously get pushed to leave asap.  They weren't even slammed.  Let alone or busy.  Like I said great food and beer, but if you don't want to feel like your adding to the misery go when they only have like 3 other patrons.

7/3/2018,"Costa Mesa, CA","Very busy and since the Denmark world cup game was on, it was even more busy than usual according to the goofy host. He didn't really know how to quote a wait time and said 40 minutes. So we went to the bakery next door and came back to check on how much longer after 40 minutes. Sure enough there was 3 tables outside. He said ok go ahead and take them. Meanwhile another group just walked up to the other empty table without waiting. Sundays are busier at bars, and I get it but the service was pretty slow with refills, and we didn't get check on as often. We shared: *sausage sampler with pretzel bread and 3 sauces. Spicy mustard, honey mustard and a cheese sauce. The sausages were tasty and very good. My favorite was the pretzel bread dipped in the cheese sauce. *Hot wings - Very spicy and meaty. They serve with blue cheese so I had to ask for ranch. *BLT - I saw pictures of a yummy club sandwich but they no longer have it so this was the replacement. Super yummy with alfalfa sprouts and thick cut bacon and turkey, avocado on toasted sourdough. Side of onion rings - they were ok you only get 4 onion rings with the $2 additional price. *Beer - get a taste for $1.75 to sample the beers, very good option. *Kids meals - $9 but the portions are HUGE. My kid got the chicken fingers with fries and it was a massive amount of food.",3 star rating,Isabel S.

Finally, a guy came up and said ""I can help you or you can go to the bar"". I guess because we only wanted drinks and apps?  Anyway, we then waited and waited for the bartender to acknowledge us only to find out that there really was t a happy hour and sorry.  We ordered a couple of drinks and skipped the appetizer now.  As we seated ourselves and started drinking our drinks, one of us had a cracked glass!  Whatever we are out of here.",2 star rating,Sherry M.

6/21/2019,"Oakland, CA","One star for being the only place open past 8pm. The food was unnecessarily over seasoned and over spiced which overpowered any flavor. They have horrible service outside for those hoping to embrace the summer evening cool-down. Be warned: You will be forgotten, disregarded, and your drinks will be empty for an unacceptable amount of time before you and your company notice any server walking by to plead for water. Your water will arrive late and you'll have to share. (aside from the sight of two empty glasses and asking for two refills, your server will bring one glass in a walk-by-and-drop fashion without pausing long enough for you to ask where the other is). Inexperienced, ill-mannered staff that have no concept of the words ""customer service"" is a darn shame for such a great location with good live bands and a menu that reads appealing.We attempted to give them a second chance the next evening for dessert in the off chance the night before wasn't their norm, and again, it was the only place open past 9pm. Went in a few hours before closing and was met by an unfriendly off duty staff member who pointed us towards an on duty staff member that was hanging out in the parking lot. We stood inside as we watched her walk over to the parking lot, unenthusiastically pointed us out, then the two employees and parking lot pal all looked over at us like we were imposing and interrupting their time. We just walked out as they continued their huddle in the parking lot, observing there was plenty of seated patrons with drinks and fare. I hope management sees this so we can come back another time and enjoy such a great spot. For a travel destination town with such diversity in tourists, we were impressed with the band's music selection as it wasn't the expected international crowd focused karaoke go-to songs.",1 star rating,D J.

I should've sampled the beer before choosing, but we were in a hurry. The Great Dane IPA was smooth but I was hoping for something a little more flavorful. It was also very dark inside and I didn't notice much decor. However, we happened to sit right next to the jukebox that had some free plays on it and it was a lot of fun. I was a little surprised that when we first entered, the person didn't seem to know anything about their menu or items. Maybe he was new but it was a bit odd. Nevertheless, it was a fun end to a long day.",4 star rating,rachel b.

6/20/2018,"Gardnerville, NV","Bring your appetite, the servings are very healthy. I rarely give 5 stars, since there is always room for improvement. This place was amazing. We ordered the beer sampler and their beers were fantastic. We ordered the pretzel appetizer. Hey, we were in Solvang, so pretzels it is. I am thinking about them right now and wish I had a batch. It comes with a cheese or mustard sauce. Both were delicious. We split the beet salad, which was good. Red and golden beets. The serving was enough for 4 people, but we were hungry. I had the fish and chips as my entree. Light on the batter, which I prefer. I want to taste my fish. It was a cod and so creamy. Yummy! My Mother-in-Law had the Danish meatballs and she was in heaven. A very healthy portion. My honey had the Schnitzel. The mashed potatoes took up half of the plate.Now for the service. We arrived early, so our server was very attentive, without being obnoxious. More people started to gather as the evening went on and we were being taken care of my multiple servers. The owner even came by and asked how we were doing. I felt we were well taken care of.I would definitely come back. The food was great and the service was very attentive.",5 star rating,Sandra F.

5/5/2017,"Brea, CA","Perhaps I am a bit crazy, because the first place I wanted to go after arriving in the wine country of Central California was a brewery. As a lover of craft beer, I was excited to see what Danish style beer was about. This brewery has 10 beers on tap, and happily they offer samples of everything. I sampled the two IPAs on the menu, but neither were quite hoppy enough for me so I ordered the Hive Honey Blonde instead. While not the best I've ever had, it was sweet and crisp and left me with a very mild but pleasant buzz. The location is quite nice - lots of seating in both the bar and restaurant area. Pints are only $6 each, which is a steal. Service is a little slow though, especially considering the bar was only a quarter full.

We were all having fun and enjoying our drinks and around 1ish they told us they couldn't serve us anymore because they thought we were too drunk. We were not being belligerent or disruptive, we were just acting like how normal people would act at a bar. We were kind of shocked and the bride tried to talk to them but they wouldn't budge.

The place is clean and so are the bathrooms. The servers are fast and cheerful. Someone ordered food and it was fresh and looked as though a 5 star restaurant had made it from its presentation. It was s fun day and this bar was a nice place to hang out. The seating outside was nice because the closeness to the beach gives you a cool breeze.,5 star rating,JoAnna S.

I think if you are a brewery then update you list every day. Food, good. Everything was flavorful and as described. Service... well... awful. Maybe we were just came in at a bad time, maybe we were the table that just things don't go right that night. Her excuses were not accepted by me or my family. Took a very long time for everything. Disorganized and inefficient. The service can certainly ruin a meal and this definitely did. If you are busy, short staffed, slammed, just explain saying you are trying your best, don't try and convince me it's not your fault.

My husband and I arrived in town after 10 PM and hardly anything was open, but this place was warm and friendly with plenty of civilized customers enjoying their brews and a live band playing on the patio. Our waitress was a little busy but still super nice. We ordered the BLTA and the 1547 burger and both were ENORMOUS.  Like, can't-even-fit-in-your-hand enormous.  Both were fresh and delicious (although too big to finish in one sitting!) and their sweet potato fries were delectable. We ordered the Stout chocolate brownie to take back to our hotel and it, too, was huge and supremely satisfying.  For the amount of food we got, the price was more than fair, unlike other restaurants that charge $15 for a tiny plate.  We'll be back soon!",5 star rating,Shea J.

It's a Sunday and it's about 5pm....so they waiter returns and says yep they are out of supplies for pizza. So hubby orders the sausage sampler, and I ordered the danish muffins. After the sausage plate comes my husband asks the waiter which sausage is which (3 different types and one was supposed to be a boar meat sausage) and the waiter says oh we are out of boar sausage. Whaat?! I mentioned I saw another waiter deliver a pizza and our waiter says oh we have pizza now...What?!

While we were waiting for our food a staff member approached us and said that if our dog keeps barking then we're going to have to leave (our dogs had only barked once when greeting each other). He proceeded to let the other family know the same thing. Obviously we were annoyed because not only was our dog not barking, the other dog was not either and THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE ON THE PATIO BUT US.

4/26/2017,"Plantation, FL","We got into Solvang after a long day of driving. This was the only place open serving food without going back into town by the highway. The main restaurant part was closed for the evening, and the only place to eat was near the bar which had a band playing. When I say playing, it was SO LOUD you would think you were in an amphitheater standing next to all the speakers lined up at full volume. Obnoxiously loud. We were tired and starving, and that was the last thing we wanted to hear. We couldn't even hear each other speak. Needless to say, as hungry as we were we left. I felt like I was in a low end hostel with the loudest music that you ever did hear. I can't figure out what the hype about this area is.",1 star rating,Skye A.
1/3/2018,"Los Alamitos, CA","Our experience here was quite the disaster. We made reservations for a party of 12. When we showed up, we were seated at a table appropriate for 7. The hostess apologized, which was fine, but it was still downhill from there. We had to wait for a table to leave in order to have enough space to accommodate all of us. When they finally did leave, it took some time to bus the table and no one brought the menus/silverware over from the table at which we were originally seated. I brought it all over myself. Fine, still. It was an inconvenience, which again, would have been fine,  but it didn't stop here. I ask for kids menus and was told by the hostess that they don't have any. OK, fine, again. So the kids all pick food from the regular menu only to be told by the waiter that they do have a kids' menu. Turns out what the hostess meant was they don't have any more ""printed"" kids menus, not that they don't offer a kids menu. At this point, I'm SMH. So, we order and I glance down at my phone and realize that an hour after we arrived, with reservations, we still had no food on our table. The food finally comes and my cod tacos were horrid. The fish was dry and over cooked and the three sad tortillas burnt. The waiter took it back and comped the dish. OK, I guess I'll nibble off other people's plates. I wasn't going to order again given how long it took for food to come out the first time. My mother-in-law orders the carnitas nachos and asks for the carnitas on the side. She's vegetarian and there were no real vegetarian options, so, she opted for nachos asking them to put the meat on a separate plate for the carnivores of the table. The nachos come with carnitas on them, so the waiter takes it back. It takes about 10 minutes for her nachos to come back. Everything seemed fine until she gets to the middle of her nacho stack and finds .... MEAT! They didn't remake the nachos. They just scraped off the top layer of meat and try to pass it off as having been remade. For strict vegetarians like my mom-in-law, this is very upsetting. Nachos are a cheap commodity. It doesn't cost a lot to remake it and to do it right. Overall, this place was one disaster after another. I wanted to like them, but for the price, one really should expect so much more. They tried to cut some serious corners and for that, this is definitely do NOT recommend.",1 star rating,Chi K.
12/11/2019,"Irvine, CA","We came here on Thanksgiving. We understand that it's a holiday and it was busy, but it's not an excuse to have us wait for more than an hour for our to-go orders  . When we came in, the girl didn't even bother to greet us. We had to tell her ourselves that we're ordering for to-go. We waited for  10 min for her to get our orders. After she took our orders, we waited outside because we had our dog with us. After about 20 min we went back in to follow up on our orders and found out that one of our orders was not available. She didnt even bother telling us. They didnt start making our orders because the girl did not give them the small paper with our orders written on it. So we went back outside to wait again. She told us our orders will be ready in 30-40 min. Since there's no other places to go to eat, we decided to just wait. So after 40 min, my son went back in to check on our orders and the girl told him we had to pay 15% gratuity because it was a big order. I dont mind giving tips if I am getting a really good service. We just let it go and didnt bother to argue because we were already hungry and it was freezing, we just wanted to get out of there with our food. So our orders came after waiting another 15 min. And 2 orders were missing! By this time, I was really getting frustrated. They told us we had to wait again if we want to order 2 more burgers. We didnt want to wait anymore. One waitress was really nice and apologetic. But the girl who took our orders didnt even bother to apologize for HER mistakes. On our way out, she didnt even say anything to us.

4/4/2018,"Reno, NV","On my California vacation I decided to check out the small town of Solvang. For lunch we decided to go to the Solvang Brewing Company. We got seated right away. We ordered off of the appetizers menu to split between the five of us we're eating there. We ordered water to start us off, which tasted strongly of bleach. I would definitely recommend getting something else to drink besides water. It took about 25 minutes to get our food. Once we did we notice that the nachos have a huge serving which was listed in the menu. The nachos consisted mostly cheese and not a lot of meat and other toppings. The meat was mostly on the bottom and there were barely any chips to counteract all the cheese that was melted on of the nachos. The pretzels were probably the best thing we ate there nice and salty and warm. First off when we got our food the waiter didn't tell us which sausages match with which sauce. Apparently you have to ask them to learn what sausages go with which sauce. Once we learned which sausages went with the sauce, we found them very tasty. We did not get forks to go with our meal. Once we got our forks it was easier to eat the nachos and sausage. All in all, the place was good and I would recommend it.",3 star rating,Lisa H.

There were no sprouts either. It was a wimpy little salad that was way over priced. My husband got the taco which were just decent. Then we pressed a second beer but only got one of them. We didn't see much of the server and our bill took forever. They need to hire more people to work there. I would say the best thing was that the server was very nice.

12/24/2018,"Oceanside, CA","We were looking so forward to the schnitzel and beef stroganoff to top off our 5-year anniversary weekend. Upon entering the restaurant we encountered a very flustered millennial girl. She told us that she would seat us just as soon as she ""found these other people"" on her list. She did not take our names, and shortly after she greeted us, another couple arrived and she told them the same information. She hurried away to seat the other people and came back to the front. She approached the couple who came in after us..(if she had taken our names she'd have known we were first) luckily they were honest and corrected her. She seated us in the tap roo.. If we had it to do over again we'd have chosen the dining room. It was very loud in the tap room.Carlos was our server. I know this not because he introduced himself but because our millenial hostess told us. We ordered our drinks and waited a few moments until Carlos returned. I ordered the beef stroganoff and my husband the schnitzel. We were excited for our meals to arrive, my husband especially looking forward to his favorite schnitzel. Imagine his disappointment when Carlos returned to say,""My friend I'm sorry to say that we are out of schnitzel. It's been a very busy day."" My husband was so disappointed. He reluctantly ordered the beef stroganoff. Additionally, he asked Carlos for a tall Amaretto Sour from the bar. A few moments later Carlos returned to say that they were out of Amaretto. Well, my husband pointed out that he could see it on the shelf. Carlos asked if my husband would like to come point it out to the millenial bartender. Seriously? Would she like him to come make it also? I spoke up and said that it was in a square bottle with a black lid that said, DiSorrano. She says, ""Oh, he wants a DiSorrano sour"". A well-trained bartender wold have known that DiSoranno is a brand if Amaretto. Just sayin. So he got his drink, it was so-so. Overall our experience was somewhat disappointing.

The kids menu features your typical options: PB&J, chicken tenders, spaghetti, etc. The staff is a little slow but are friendly and eager to help if you when you wave them down. There are a couple traditional Danish dishes on the menu and beer steins if that's what you're looking for. They brew their own beer too. There is a giant television glowing in the main dinning room and a video game arcade. The food is good and the portions are filling.

Ok. Made some adjustments and ordered. Appetizers supposed to have ranch dressing. Had to ask two people twice to get it.  Beers were mixed.  Some bland. Didn't get the Raspberry ipa I ordered but the absent minded IPA made me forget about the waitresses poor attitude and forgetfulness.  Lunch was really good.  I had pastrami sandwich which is big and satisfying.  Guy next to me wanted to trade and I almost did because his sausage plate looked terrific.  Trip tip sandwich also a winner.

I had beet salad and French onion soup. The soup was decent but really salty, the salad was also ok. The beets were a bit soggy and there were so many. I would have preferred less beets of higher quality and better preparation. The greens were ok. Kids had pasta that they said smelled weird. It was just pasta with butter and a little cheese and it did actually smell weird. I didn't taste it. It didn't smell bad, just odd. I'm not sure what kind of water they cooked the plain noodles in but the kids weren't really into it. They are picky though. They devoured the fruit. Husband had the Danish meatballs. It was a massive portion. He said it was good. I had a brown ale and he had the amber, beer wise. Both were just ok.

The bartender was super sweet and you could most people at the bar were repeat customers because she knew them well.  They also had a lot of beers on tap, and they had samples you could buy if you wanted to try them.  I don't really have a discerning taste for beer, but my husband liked them!",4 star rating,Miss Maggie C.

Believe it or not it was actually a little difficult to locate somewhere during the day that had a full bar. Upon walking in, it was easy to see the place was pretty packed. There was one corner booth available so we sat down with a party of five. Service was good, quick. We ordered a pitcher of beer, a few cocktails and some appetizers.Of course when ordering at a bar, there is bar Food. Nothing healthy or organic lol so we said what the hell, let's order!Sweet potato fries, onion rings, fried zucchini, pretzel bread and the sausage trio sampler. I did not have any of the sausage, but everyone seemed to like it. Everything else was as good as it could get. Fries were fresh and tasty. Onion rings were great and the zucchini was good too. Pretzel bread was baked just right with cheese and mustard dip. They have a variety of sauces available upon request. The funny thing is even though I had a ton of fried food and beer, I didn't leave feeling half as bad as I anticipated!!",4 star rating,Sahar S.
8/31/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA",It was my first time visiting this place and when I drove by- it looked like the happening place in Lompoc so I had to stop  I sat at the bar with my girlfriends  and was unsure of what to drink since I had never been there before. One of the beertenders  went over the beers with me to find one that I'd like. And she explained that the beers were actually brewed on site. After a few minutes She found me a beer that I LOVED. We also got some nachos to munch on. And holy guacamole. The nachos were HUGE AND BOMB!! We had to take some home. Between 3 of us and some beers we could not finish them. If anyone driving by sees this place stop here and ask for Liana.  She was amazing and made me feel welcomed and I didn't make me feel dumb for asking too many question since I'm not a professional beer taster. She was really professional and knew her menu and beers. She was really awesome  I'm coming back for some blue eyed lager and to try more of their yummy food.,5 star rating,Jenay B.

Fries and fish were crisp on outside moist inside. Salad so yummy with loads of meat and goodies. The pizza was good and we took half home. The three of us then shared a brownie with coffee ice cream. The brownie was molten dark chocolate in the middle so decadent. The ice cream was my only disappointment could have been a better quality:  rather icy not creamy. The beers were tasty we ordered a flight then chose the Valhalla IPA, Stout, and Brown Ale to accompany our meal. Our server Michaela was so sweet and attentive. We'll be back!",4 star rating,Kim V.

We arrived around noon and were promptly seated. We waited a bit before our waitress acknowledged us, but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy Sunday. I ordered the oatmeal stout (yum!) and mixed sausage platter (more yum!) My fiance ordered a cheeseburger and lemonade.  Our drinks took close to 10 minutes to arrive. We placed our food order when our drinks arrived. It took FIFTY MINUTES for our food to arrive! Fortunately our waitress was on top of things and alerted the manager.  The manager was gracious, showed us love and made up for the wait. Our food did arrive, it was delicious, our server was great.

2/16/2020,"Granada Hills, CA","A message to the owner: Your manager turned away 12 people waiting in line at the bar who were standing behind me trying to order a beer. He made a loud announcement that they needed to check in with the hostess at the front, wait to be seated at a table and said he didn't understand why there were so many people standing in line in the bar area. Hello!!! The sign outside says Solvang Brewing Company. Some people just want to order a beer, enjoy it and keep moving. Not wait around for there name to be called to sit inside this shitty place. Luckily someone took my order at the bar after 10 minutes and I was able to order drinks for my party and we sat outside at the front patio. I love breweries and support them but this one sucks. It could be such a cool place. As I was drinking my beer I noticed people coming up to the front, talk to the hostess, then just walk away. Seems like this place doesn't care about the customer and most importantly to an owner, making money.",1 star rating,Ross P.
10/26/2017,"Solvang, CA","I'm struggling with this one, for right now it's two stars. I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner because we are local and had not been. We started with cocktails and ordered the soft pretzels with the Stout fondue. My Old Fashioned was a little sweet, like they used orange liquor in it. Whatever, it's a brew pub, can't expect a perfect cocktail. My wife's margarita was excellent. The soft pretzels, omg good.....loved those. The issue was really a service problem. We both ordered the Surf & Turf, my plate came about 4 minutes after our starters. Call me picky, but timing is everything in the restaurant business. Let me enjoy my starters before you sit my entree in front of me, please. About 5 minutes later, my wife's entree still had not arrived. We hailed the waitress and were quite surprised when she told us she thought we were sharing? I informed her that we indeed had ordered two and wanted two entrees and asked her to take mine back and make us two new entrees. She told me she would see what she could do with my current plate and have new ones made. 20 minutes later, my new entree comes out alone, with a second plate as a heat shield below it. My wife's entree still did not come out together with mine, maybe another 5 minutes. They had stuck my entree under a heat lamp for 20 minutes while they made my wife's. I'm not paying 32$ for an entree that's been sitting around for over half an hour. There was no way we were going to deal with another round waiting for them to do it right. We sent both entrees back (they did offer to make them both again and comp one) as we had a time limit of two hours for our date night (kids...argh!). The manager offered to comp our drinks, I refused that. I wasn't looking for anything free, I just didn't want to pay for the entrees we didn't touch. Both the waitress and manager were great, apologetic (as was I, for some reason I always feel guilty when something like this happens). In the end the manager gave us a free dessert for the trouble and knocked 25% off our appz and drinks. The free dessert kind of cracked me up, it was offered as a remedy for the problems, but when the reservation was made they said you get a free dessert when celebrating a special occasion like this anyways. I'm going to give it another chance for two reasons. The staff was nice and the food looked amazing. I'll update this review and change the star rating when we go back. Adding a pic of the YUMMY pretzels. Didn't get a good picture of the rest as my mind was on the issues.",2 star rating,Jay B.

We much prefer the patio to the dining room which is pretty dark in the daytime and if you don't love the current music you are stuck with it and cannot have a conversation. I dropped a star today because I am still bothered by an up-charge of $3.00 for onion rings added to my awesome club sandwich. The onion rings are really good - a nice touch of red pepper, perfectly fried. But $3.00 for 4 onion rings instead of fries or a Caesar salad? That is almost $1.00 per onion ring???

7/7/2017,"La Mirada, CA","We go to Solvang at least once a year. This place and the Los Olivos Grill are the 2 spots we go to every time. My three go to's were the Viking Dog, Corn Dog and the Fish n Chips. Neither dog is on the menu now and the Fish n Chips has been reduced to two small patties on a bed of fries. New owners I guess. Let's not forget the price has increased about 50%. When I asked why such a higher price for smaller servings, the manager said, everything in Solvang is more expensive.With no Corn Dog to enjoy, I ordered the American Burger. The waiter offered medium as the normal cook on that. Of course I wanted medium. I also said no onions. What I got was an over cooked burger, loaded with raw red onions. Hey look, they sell Micheladas. We'll try 2. Worst version ever made. If you're going to sell this drink, make sure you know how to make one. What else? was refilled with a regular Coke instead of diet coke. Waiter said ""no problem, easy to fix"" Sure, if it's just a flavor choice. If you're diabetic, it's kind of a big deal. The waiter didn't appear to care much about the bad food or mistakes made on the orders. Manager eventually came over. Told him about the bad drinks and the burned burger. He said he would take care of it. What we got was, the 2 drinks were taken off the bill and, a whole $3.76 discount on my uneaten, bad, $16 burger. Never again.",1 star rating,armando j.

We were seated pretty quickly which to me is a sign that they weren't too busy. We were helped after only a few minutes for our drinks. 10 min later our order was taken. We weren't asked if we wanted an appetizer so we ordered our meal and appetizer at the same time. The waiter quickly brought out some ketchup in Lil cups.............waiting...........still waiting 40, 50, 60 min later, I lost track, we get our food served by someone else. I get that sometimes it gets busy  but Not once did our waiter come over to ck on us during that time and not once did he come while we were eating. We had 4 people sharing 2 meals. Didn't get any xtra plates so we ate off the same plate. Half way thru our meal another waiter comes over to ck on us and we told him we never got our appetizer. A few mins later when we were just about done w/ our meal  our original MIA waiter comes over and asked ""is everyone happy?"" Really ???? It's been well over an hour and a half since we last saw you and you have the nerve to ask that! We all said ""NO"" He said he thought we wanted the appetizer w/ our meal that's why we didn't get it 1st which is a bullshit answer because we were bites away from being done and still no appetizer They brought the appetizer and didn't charge us.

The cook obviously was too tired to care about his food, since he wasn't eating it. Desert: Nine dollar desert was a brownie not unlike one you could buy at a convenience store, with a bit of ice cream on top. Not creative. Overpriced.

7/21/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Went in tonight with family to celebrate a birthday. They were busy which is great. However, customer service was absolutely terrible. I will never be back. We waited over 45 minutes for our appetizers to be served. We asked several times where the food was and were told we would receive our food ""in just a minute."" We placed our orders for our meals and waited an additional hour. The waiter barely checked on us. We sat with empty drinks for most of our time there. When we finally flagged him down, we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over very confrontational and told us ""it's only been 28 minutes""  he made no apologies and said our food would be right up. I have never a experienced a manager with this little customer service skills. We waited another 20 minutes for the food. We waited only because we had kids crying for food. In addition to all of this, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy. We let the waiter know when  we got there that the bathrooms needed to cleaned. They weren't touched in the over 2 hours we spent here. ** i want to add, our waiter appeared to be actively avoiding our table. It was not that he was so busy that he couldn't come over and check on us/refill drinks. He would check on the people immediately next to us but would avoid eye contact with us and shout ""just a sec"" to us. His ""sec"" would then turn into 20 minutes.",1 star rating,Emily R.

Came in to pay at 657pm and was told the kitchen was backed up and would be about 20-25mins. Checked in at 723 and didn't leave with my food until 730. I understand being busy, but 40mins for one burger is ridiculous. Also, there was not a single apology from the staff. Very disappointed.",1 star rating,Jenn M.
6/3/2015,"San Francisco, CA","This place is new since the last time I have been in town, I'm glad it's here. They have a great variety of beers on tap, great menu items and great service.To start we got the sausage plate, fried zucchini and 4 5oz. Samplers of beer. The sampler is a good way to start, they have a good variety of beers. I tried these beers: Blond: Clean and without consequences, it's certainly good but not bold. Raspberry wheat: Great wheat flavors, nice raspberry overtones and a great nose. Zythos IPA: Super hoppy but not over powering. Stout: Super smooth and rich flavors. I think this was the best. The fried zucchini is breaded with a panko like bread crumb and served with dressing. They slice it thinly on the lengthwise axis. It's a bit different from other fried zucchini sticks I've had and was a nice surprise. The sausage sampler is great. These 3 items paired with beer make a great light lunch for 2 people.",5 star rating,Ben M.

7/6/2019,"North Hollywood, CA","I'm giving one star because I can't post this without any stars selected!! This restaurant is the worse place my friends & I have ever eaten at!!!!! First of all, we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. We were told that the kitchen was small for accommodating a crowded restaurant. We ordered a French Dip sandwich, 2 bowls of French Onion soup and a salad. Not complicated meals for over an hour wait!!!!! Then when our food came out it was cold! Both bowls of the French Onion soup were lukewarm. The Aus Jus   for the French Dip sandwich was also lukewarm. We were told that the Aus Jus was supposed to be lukewarm. It was totally unacceptable!!! The tri tip on the French Dip sandwich tasted like commercial grade beef. They took the bowls of soup off our bill and gave us a discount on the sandwich. The discount on the sandwich was 10% off which came to $1.60.....very insulting!!!!!!! I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody nor would I ever eat at this restaurant ever again!!!! The food is not even mediocre, over priced and the service is the worst I have ever experienced!",1 star rating,Cindy A.
9/28/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","When compared to other breweries this one falls a little short on the experience of a brewery itself. No community seating or games. It feels more like a bar, as it's crowded and we were even flat out turned away from even waiting on one busy mid summer afternoon on a Saturday. Being as determined as anyone, we got in, and the service was slow! The workers are friendly and the beer is ever so yummy!

Which either means he's a sarcastic idiot or an oblivious fool! We leave in a rage but decided to send one of our party to complain to management. Mr. Thanks for coming in. Overheard us asking for management and decided to step in....our oblivious fool is in fact one of the managers, explains why the place has shit service The GM ... a useless twat...""ANDREW"" didn't bother apologizing or trying to correct a single issue.

8/10/2015,"Gold River, CA","hi-ya!This is an updated review, but it wasn't as I remembered it (the bar that is).  I guess ordinance requires police to check IDs--not that, that is a problem, but I'm trying to relax and I don't like the annoyance of having to prove my age or have the 5-O presence around--not that I have a criminal background. Haha, but they were busy tonight and service was slow.  Our table didn't get cleaned, we kind of bussed it ourselves.The reason I scaled back my review is because I felt like it became more of bar and less of a karaoke AND bar.  I know it sounds dumb, but what I mean is that the lively atmosphere that I remember going to really was watered down with a lot of just hard core drinking.  I know they had a live 2-man band there that night, but it felt like their music just melted in as background noise...and not so much music you stop and listen to while drinking.",3 star rating,Ronny S.

Waitresses were super nice.Beer: Raspberry wheat was beyond refreshing.Tap burger: Medium rare, on point. Beyond juicy. Thick Bacon was crispy. Delicious! Carnitas Nachos: these babies stole the show! The portion was HUGE. This is a 4 people dish. All the flavors where there. Very flavorful Carnitas topped with crema with goat cheese shaved on top, the salsa (not spicy at all) , tones of guacamole. It was simply mouth drooling delicious.I was happy when I left, and like i said, I will come back.",5 star rating,Cookie H.

10/6/2015,"Alameda, CA","Will have to come back in the future to try the food.  It looked good. Smelled good too.We went here to taste beer, and they charge $1.75 per taste. No flights.  Ok. We tried 3 each and I was satisfied with my choices. None were over the top spectacular,  but solid and worth drinking. Will need to try the rest next time. Good IPA and no Cascade hops.   Just couldn't wrap my head around the change of the overall establishment.  The Danish Inn and the Viking Room were typical stops on trips here over the last 40 years. I'm glad they kept quite a bit of the history of the place. Wish I could have spent more time here. I'm a beer drinker. Wine is okay. The town,  the region,  is becoming a wine soaked snob fest. The tasting rooms littered throughout town are more of a ""bar"" atmosphere.  At least this is what it's supposed to be, but the noise level was acceptable.  Should have asked if they had Aquavit. That's what I came here for in the past. And Danish food.  Another reason to return soon.",4 star rating,Venka A.

They were out of bleu cheese, so got substituted for another type, and we didn't even get it until I went and asked another employee. My boyfriends burger wasn't medium like he asked, a couple of times. Waters weren't refilled, either.

4/17/2015,"San Diego, CA","Solvang Brewing Company = Beer.  We're dining here!My husband and I were strolling down Mission Street looking for a place to eat and we were immediately drawn to the windmill which is one of the prime photo stops and the fact that this restaurant is a brewery.Upon entering the restaurant unfortunately there was no host to greet us and we waited a few minutes for someone to seat us.  It was a bit awkward because one of the servers that seemed to be getting off or going on break saw us and felt bad that we were just standing there and helped to seat us.  We decided to dine outside to enjoy the wonderful weather and people watch.  There are two menus one with an updated beer list with all their selections on tap and I believe another one with their seasonal choices so don't get confused.  Loved the fact that a 5oz taster is only $1.50?  Quite a steal.  I ordered the black IPA and the Odin's stout and the husband ordered the Danske amber ale.  I enjoyed the flavors of my beer selections.  We ordered the sausage sampler and the beef stroganoff.  The sausage sampler was good.  It came with 3 different sausages and a pretzel.  Although I wasn't sure whether or not that pretzel was supposed to be a little cool in the center I guess they didn't warm it up all the way?  Regardless, it didn't taste fresh and I was a bit disappointed because let me tell you when you're hungry and you see these babies being carried past you to other tables they looked pretty delicious.  The stroganoff was pretty flavorful and the portions are pretty hefty.  You'll definitely be full from that.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  A mediocre first time experience.  In all honesty, it just wasn't very memorable.  The one thing that I did remember was that there is a giant jenga that you could play with outside.",3 star rating,Christine D.

Yummy.. my boyfriend had the blue cheese burger, I had a bite & the bacon was so delicious, melted in my mouth... the reason for the 4 stars is the slow service.

10/5/2015,"Orange, CA","Strict beer review only, on my drive up the coast we stopped into Solvang to check out the city as I had never been. This place caught my eye as we drove into town and I just knew I had to pop in. I love breweries and see what people have to offer. The place was quite as it was during the week and mid day. Not a lot of peeps just a few local patrons quenching their thirst.So lets talk about the beer, I will say it was ok. And allow me to explain, I just felt like each beer while being a different style all kind of finished the same and tasted similar. I have been to places like this where its a very safe and traditional style of brewing beer and you will get a similar flavor with all the types of beer. Where even the stout and or porter will finish the same as the IPA or pale ale or lager. Which is ok but its just not my favorite. Still though not a bad spot to check out if you are visiting.

I can't give half stars otherwise they would get a 3.5.It's not bad, however, getting seated was kind of awkward. This place did have a bit of an odd factor though.

However, the gentleman at the King Frederik Inn (where I stayed) informed me the Brewing Company was a good choice. It scored extra points too, since it was in walking distance. The place was packed, inside and out, but since I was a party of just 1, they cleaned a quick 4-top for me, and I was sat in the bar area. An added bonus, was a live band was playing, too. The menu choices were plentiful and I decided to order the Pork Belly Tacos and a Crispin Cider. Both were out of this world! The Pork Belly was salted and cooked, just right. The accompaniments, to the taco, added a sweetness and fresh balance, unlike no other. I like Cider beers, but hadn't tried the Crispin brand before. New fan. Chris was my server and he was hustling all over the place. Super sweet guy, that checked on me often and was ready to re-order me another beer, before I knew I was ready for one myself!

We ordered an appetizer, salad and entree and they all came out at the same time which was kind of annoying. The nachos looked massive but we steared away from those and got the Shrimp Ceviche Cocktail. It wasn't until the waitress brought us the ceviche that she told us there was no more guacamole and asked if we wanted salsa. Wish she would have told us ahead of time, the guac is kind of a deal breaker. Considering it took over half an hour to get an appetizer and salad that required no cooking you would think she could let us know if they were out of something. None the less, the chips for the ceviche were good but the ceviche itself was okay. Nothing special at all about it. We got the Ahi Tuna salad which was REALLY good. The dressing was great. The tuna was fresh. Pickled veggies on the side were tasty. We also got the tap room burger with grilled onions. It was cooked how we requested and was also tasty and large.",3 star rating,Lucy F.

The beers were so good but if we wanted to take some to go (in a growler or in bottles!) we'd have to drive to Lompoc, and that was the opposite of where we needed to be :( I would recommend this to anyone looking for a chill place w great food.

Our food took over an hour to come out which for a pizza some tacos and a salad is a bit long.  Our server seems lost throughout the experience.

4/23/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Decided to try this brewery on a Friday night after a day of winetasting in Solvang. The location itself is very ample however half of the restaurant was closed down. The bar area was extremely crowded and there was a band playing which occupied a majority of the floor space. I'm assuming that because it was the weekend they had open seating. As a result, we had to find our own table, ask and wait for someone to clean the table, then walk to the bar to order food/drinks and then walk back to the bar to pick up the food. When trying to relax on a Friday night this place was too much of a hassle. Maybe if the whole restaurant would have been opened and they had tableservice it would've been a better experience.",2 star rating,Jen P.
7/31/2016,"Las Vegas, NV","This is a rather tough review to write as part of me highly respects the business owners for investing money in Solvang and providing the only true late not spot in this town. Unfortunately, the location coupled with the hours are not enough to earn a 5 star review. The service was, quite possibly, the slowest and most inattentive I have ever experienced. Considering it wasn't even a very crowded night (Thursday in July), the wait to simply put our order in was 15 minutes. Followed by over 30 minutes to get our appetizer, which was nachos that were room temperature at best. Another 25 minutes goes by and our kids get their meals and the wife and I are still waiting. 10 more minutes and we got our entrees. I chose the tacos and I guess when it rains it pours, as the tacos were lacking in every way possible, from flavor to temperature to portion size. Our drinks were perpetually empty and refills didn't come until the bill was dropped off. We spent over two hours in this place and didn't even leave satisfied with our meal or our experience. The better choice for those in Solvang overnight is to eat earlier and avoid dinner here at all costs.",1 star rating,Michael H.

3/21/2018,"Hampton, VA","I didn't know what to expect when I rolled into Solvang. This little town reminded me of Busch Gardens. The whole town had this old country look to it and the streets we packed with people. I mean there were thousands of people crowded on the sidewalks and cars were bumper to bumper in the street. It reminded me of south beach Miami Florida at midday during spring break. after I finally found a place to park my car, I strolled over the the Brewery where I met some coworkers for lunch. I ordered a flight of beer and some bbq wings. The beer was cold. The flavors I selected were on point and the wings were huge. The atmosphere was similar to that of any large pub that you'd ever visited. Lots of loud conversations and people having fun. I only tried 4-5 beer during my visit.

My niece and I both had the sausage sampler. Their lunches arrived exactly 15 minutes ahead of mine. Weird, right? No excuses, no sorry, no manager, no nothing.

As for the wings, I thought they were good. They seemed to be pre baked or boiled and then deep fried, covered in sauce and parsley (wings do not need green stuff lol).

Everyone wearing their coats at their tables so not just us. We moved to a table near the fireplace and only the person sitting against it benefitted from it. Waitress did turn up heat and eventually did become more comfortable. My SIL's Jaeger schnitzel was good. My husbands Ruben was okay. My stroganoff was not good. Could taste the powder mix used for beef flavoring in the sauce. Blech. All the food arrived luke warm after waiting quite awhile for it. Servers were warm and friendly. Water glass was always full.

5/29/2017,"Concord, CA","Service: 1/2 starWhen we arrived, there were 2 parties waiting to be seated and they did within a minute of us arriving. Then there were 6 tables open. The hostess still made us and 2 other groups wait 5 minutes. 5 minutes doesn't seem long, but why when there are tables open?The waitress took our orders and though I stated I wanted the Danish Burger, she wrote down Reuben, apparently, though I didn't know that at  the time. The guy that dropped off the food, took off so quickly, I didn't get a chance to tell him I didn't order the Reuben. Then it took another 5 minutes to flag down someone in the staff. And yes, there was a waiter that looked right at me while I waited my arm in the air at him. So my husband had to flag someone down. That's when I found out that the waitress had written down the wrong order. I don't know how you hear Reuben from Danish Burger. They did give me my correct order after that. I must also point out that next to us, there were 3 other tables with service issues.There was a party of 6 who waited to get their check until all but 1 stayed and told the busboy who had started clearing her table that she had not gotten the bill her. The second table with a couple and a tiny baby had gotten their appetizer but waited 45 minutes to get their dinner. They finally cancelled their order because the baby had to be fed.The third table consisted of 4 people, 2 of which got  the wrong order also and sent it back.Food: 3 starsThe food was decent, though super salty. The beer was fine, not terrible, but not exceptional, either.   I thought it worth $10, but not the $14.95 listed on the menu.

They have a pretty extensive list of beers. Took a while just looking through it. We decided to sample a few. They come in 3 oz. glasses for a reasonable price. We weren't interested in a full on meal and only needed something to go with the beer. We ordered 4 sliders which were pretty yummy. The patty was perfectly cooked. They used those Hawaiian sweet buns, but I don't think that went well together. It just made those buns soggy and mushy. The beer was top notch though! Yum yum! Burrrp~",4 star rating,Cindy K.
2/15/2020,"San Luis Obispo, CA",Ok so here goes. It's Valentine's Day weekend and I assumed everywhere would be extremely packed. We were staying across the street so we figured we'd grab a drink here and an app and go from there. We tried for the bar but it was full so we put our names down and were seated in about 10mins (hostess was very nice!). After that is where the problems began. And this is coming from someone who has been in the food business for quite some time. The place was packed when we got there but slowed down a lot right after we arrived. Still we waited for 2 beers for 45mins. And pretty sure they were poured and not taken out because they were a little warm and tasted flat. The food was much worse. We ordered a small nachos and a side salad and that took an hour. Once we got the nachos it looked like it had been sitting under a warmer for quite some time and forgot about. The guac turned dark green/brown and the cheese hardened. We couldn't eat it and for the first time in my life had to start looking for places to get food at a restaurant where I wanted to get food.

11/9/2014,"Seattle, WA","This is a pretty dingy bar for main street Solvang. That said, the burger I got was probably the best one I've had since last visiting Father's Office. And, for the $13 price tag, I was quite pleased. I got the Baja Burger, and it had so much flavor--with the crisp and perfectly sour/spicy pickled veggies (onions and jalapenos) contrasting with the juicy warmth of the burger and the creamy chill of the guacamole.... mmmmah! Slurp. It was absolutely delish and a solid 5-stars. So, why the 4-star rating? Well, the venue, like I said, was a bit lacking. And, the plates of my co-eaters were a bit less impressive. The fries were alright, but not 5-stars. And, the SBC Sausage Trio a friend got ($16.95) was a bit pricey for what you got and not that amazing in flavor. But, I guess they were supposed to be showcasing Danish food, not a spicy Italian sausage. Bottom line: Get the Baja Burger and enjoy!",4 star rating,Rebecca P.

The nachos had mouth watering photos. So we knew what to order. Also ordered two lovely baby blue blonde beers. My husband said he could drink those beers all afternoon. The nachos had a huge amount of carnitas piled inside chips, cheese, sour cream and guacamole. Excellent. We loved the sausage sampler  two types of mustard plus a cheese dip. Stick pretzel that was soft and warm. All food was piping hot. We had our dog with us, so we sat on the patio. They brought our sweet dog water. Very dog friendly.

10/18/2014,"Palm Desert, CA","Went to check out this Solvang brewery.  The bar is walled off from the restaurant.  There is a small patio out front.The bar was likely salvaged from the prior business.  It is very old school: copper bar top, dark maroon tuck and roll on the bar front and a newer juke box that played 80s rock. The servers really didnt seem to be into it.  Bartender was nice but was busy restocking the bar-shouldn't you do that before you open?  He didn't really interact or try to educate his customers on their house brews.   So I tried the Valhalla India Pale Ale.  It looked good but light if any hop notes could be be detected.  Didn't have that resinous, piny hop smell.  When I took a swig it was apparent that this was not going to measure up to West Coast IPA standards.  Very week and the bitterness doesn't hit until the back end and its fleeting. I didn't have high hopes so I wasn't really bummed.     The craft beer drinker will be able to get by but thats about it.   O am only rating on beer and service.  Note to places that brew your own:  educate your staff!",2 star rating,Matt S.
7/11/2018,"Pasadena, CA",We had the pleasure of dining at Solvang Brew Co. mainly due to the fact that most business in Solvang close pretty early. So if you're looking for a late night snack this is the place. The live music and vibe of the establishment are welcoming and the quality of the servers complement the restaurant as a whole. We tried the raspberry wheat ale and the oatmeal stout which were average at best. What really won us over was the pretzel that was served with the sausage trio plate. The sausages were above average but the pretzel was delicious. You pair that with the three sauces provided with the trio and you get an wonderful blend of flavors on your pallet. We ordered some more side orders of pretzels as well just to satisfy our taste buds and have enough pretzel to go around.,4 star rating,Eric L.

We've been here 4 different times with several months time between each visit. We will never go back here again. The bar tender did not acknowledge us, she completely ignored us, talking to a group of 5 people who were obviously her friends, and already very intoxicated. She continued to ignore us until I  made a point to ask her if we could get a couple of beers. Finally acknowledging us she said, ""I just called last call."" We ordered our beers, she got them for us and went back to chatting with her friends. She also continued serving them beers and shots the entire time we were there even though she told us she already called last call. To the manager of the brewery, we did not know her name because she wasn't wearing a name tag, she was working on the night of January 6, 2020, between 10:00-10:30 PM.

11/23/2014,"Palm Springs, CA","Great prices for great food and a staff that is quite attentive. My GF and I started our one year anniversary here in Solvang and this was our first night dinner destination. The appetizers, soft pretzels and battered zucchini, were absolutely delicious as well as large portioned. They have quite the extensive drink menu from cocktails, beers, and wine. The rest of the menu is american style but oh so original. Their pulled BBQ pork sandwich is amazing but has some kick to it, if you're sensitive to spicy. My Girlfriend had the southwest burger and the BBQed bacon on the burger was... For lack of a better word... Perfect.

When we arrived the host a young girl very professional and friendly seated us and then came over very quickly a young girl waitress who asked what we wanted to drink and brought our drinks over quickly!!After that nothing came quickly, it was so slow and the restaurant was half empty we were thinking about leaving!!!We ordered a hamburger medium and the Trio Sausages which took 35 minutes to arrive at our table!! It only came when I asked for the manager and it came in 5 minutes. I wish I would have left because the hamburger was well done and not what we asked for PLUS HAD NO TASTE !!! It was the Danish Burger and if the waiter Carlos New his menu or the MANAGER told there waiters that they only make that burger well done then WE WOULD HAVE ORDERED ANOTHER BURGER!! They did not give us the option for anything. Sausages out of 3 types only 1 had flavor the others very BAD QUALITY and NO TASTE!The MANAGER NEVER CAME OVER TO ASK US HOW EVERYTHING WAS after knowing we waited 35 minutes just for the food!I GUESS HE KNOWS THE FOOD IS BAD QUALITY AND NOT FRESH!!IWAS SICK ALL NIGHT FROM THE HAMBURGER and still thinking what rights I have in this case!!People speak highly of this restaurant and maybe they make something right or just maybe it is the only restaurant open late and this is why it works!!OR MAYBE YOU DRINK ENOUGH TEQUILA OR BEER ANYTHING IS GOOD!!!!!!",1 star rating,Paul T.

We ordered the followingOnion RingsClam chowderFish and chipsCioppinoDrinks: Blonde, Black IPA, Pale Ale, Qupe SyrahEverything was ok but nothing was great. The food was subpar...the chowder's stock was canned and that was all I could taste. Onion rings were ok but lacked seasoning in the batter.

3/17/2017,"San Ramon, CA",Had lunch here.  Thought  it would be a bit sketch because it's basically a bar that serves food but decided to give it a go.  At 1:30pm the place was pretty empty except for the locals being loud at the bar.   My turkey club was absolutely wonderful.  Fresh ingredients and the portion was so big I took half of it to go.   Not much of a beer kinda person so I told the waiter what I liked and he suggested a beer to go with my sandwich.  It went perfectly.  When ever I am in the Solvang area I would go out of my way to eat a lunch or dinner at this establishment.  The negative is that they don't have their beer bottled to go (currently only in growlers) and that the Solvang Brewery is 300+ miles from my house.  :(,5 star rating,Elaine T.
11/12/2017,"Tulare, CA","The service was great but the food was kind of awful. My phone died otherwise I would have taken a picture of the mess I was served.. I ordered their pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. The sandwich comes on a pretzel bun and is topped with coleslaw. I didn't realize I had ordered the messiest meal on the menu. First off, they served me cold food. I thought it was just the fries at first but then a bite into the sandwich I realized that was barely lukewarm and the bottom bun was extremely soggy. I figured it must have been sitting a while which is weird because we received our food pretty fast. Anyway the pulled pork sandwich is big, very moist because of the slaw and has lots of fat. They stack a lot of pork outside of the bun, to give the impression it is so full it's spilling out, which was why it's so messy. The fries are ok, better when warm. I told our server the food came out cold and he was very nice and took it back to be remade. He asked if I'd like Posole while I waited since my husband was eating. The posole is good here! Nice flavor and tender meat. My husband had the street tacos and he said they were ok but the tortillas kept splitting in half and all of the fillings kept falling out. He liked his blue eyed blonde beer. Maybe we should have went with a burger..",2 star rating,Nate S.

3/5/2016,"Normal Heights, San Diego, CA","Sadly, I'm not sure if it even deserved a ""one star."" The food was less than acceptable and the service was a notch above that.  Specifically, the onion rings were too thick, over battered and served with bottled bbq sauce.  The French onion soup was bland.  The main meal was disappointing-- the rotisserie half chicken seemed to have been pre cooked and then quickly pan fried to reheat, leaving it soggy and only warm. The brussel sprouts were steamed, over cooked and unseasoned and the mash potatoes... Well, it's hard to mess up mashed potatoes. And quite frankly, had our server Chris asked us if we were enjoying our meal when it became apparent that we barely touched the food-- this bad review may have been avoided. However it was clear he didn't care.  I HIGHLY recommend if you are in Solvang and looking for a brewery, skip this one and head 15 minutes down the road to the brewery in Buellton-- The Figueroa Mountain Brewery.  That place is amazing. Good beer and food is available (depending on the day) either by food truck or the eatery next door.",1 star rating,Löan S.

We ordered drinks & the soft pretzels for an appetizer. The pretzels were delicious!For the main course, I ordered the wild boar & smoked apple pizza. Fiancé had the tri tip sandwich. When my pizza came to the table our waiter told me they accidentally made a larger pizza but would only charge for the smaller price. I thought that was nice. However, the pizza was not what I ordered. Instead of having smoked apples it had artichoke hearts. It was still really good & the kitchen had already messed up so I didn't complain. I had overheard a couple other tables also having issues with their pizza too so maybe the cook was new?Fiancé said the sandwich was really good. Employees were all super friendly, but hostess was dressed inappropriately. All in all the food was good, outside was a nice atmosphere, & staff was friendly.

9/21/2014,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","What an great place. Very unique, open late (careful, kitchen closes before restaurant.) food was good. It was solid. They were out of a particular brew but recommended another good blonde. The pastrami was good but not delicious, I'd try something else  next visit but it was worth a try.The sausage plate was also worth a try but the bread on that plate was great. To me, two sausages tasted  like hotdogs but I'm no sausage aficionado. The service was slow but t was a holiday weekend. Not dreadfully slow, just not be good. We did appreciate that when an unruly crowd came in cursing every other word, a person addressed it immediately as they were sitting next to an elderly couple.I did not appreciate that we were seated after a two person party that came after us. We were told to wait outside and I watched as they seated the other couple before us. When I went in to inquire, We were seated. Hostess claimed she tried to call me (even though I watched the hostess the whole time and she never picked up the phone or stepped two feet or the door to call my name) but had the wrong number (which she read back to me previously). All in all I'm somewhat nostalgic about this place but we weren't seated appropriately, the hostess lied to me, and the service was slow (holiday yes, packed no). I would go back to give it another try but maybe service is better during the day. We arrived at 9ish.Try the house Root Beer only if you're a real root beer fan.",3 star rating,Devin F.

What a fantastic place - 2 dining areas plus a bar area with love music and a room with a pool table make this a comfortable and well appointed facility. The bathrooms were clean. The service was excellent and friendly. Food came out as soon as the chefs were done with it based in the temperature! I enjoyed the sausage sampler appetizer so I skipped the potatoes and cabbage and we got another side of the pretzels. They were so good! My wife had a salad that she described as one of the best and freshest she's had; I also enjoyed a 5 oz sampler pour of a stout that I found highly enjoyable.

I didn't enjoy the raspberry one very much but the blonde was pretty good. The brewery didn't feel that special compared to many other breweries I've been to. Maybe needs a little interior updating and a bit more lighting? It felt a lot more like a bar than a brewery. I guess I came expecting different. But the beers were enjoyable.

I asked to be refunded but she went to check on them. They were slightly busy but it should never take 30 minutes to put together nachos plus a couple who order after me received there food already.  The bartender was gone for about five minutes and returned with the nachos packed up. She asked if I wanted the nachos anyway since they were fresh. Basically my food was either never put in or got pushed way back. I won't be going here any longer.  I refused, got my refund and left.

The flavor and choice of items in this burger was just incredible, I loved every bite. Oh and the side salad was bomb too. But seriously this burger... I would highly suggest getting it, get the patty cooked ""medium"" and let them do the rest. WOW. The beer on tap was good too.

6/2/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Terrible, disappointing service.  As others mentioned service was almost comically slow- which at 11:30am on a weekday when it is not busy is ridiculous.  The runner spilled the pizza we ordered on the floor and on my mom.   I was a server for years so totally understand this happens and he was clearly mortified.  However, how this was handled was the worst.  When what I am assuming was the manager come out to say another pizza was on it's way.  My mom mentioned the pizza also fell on her as well was told curtly ""I was told"" then walked away.  The server then took a few more minutes to check on us - she was nice, asked if my mom had been burned by the pizza .  She then said the stain would come out yet didn't offer club soda or anything to try to help. We got the pizza a couple minutes later but we had no silverware or plates on the table still and they didn't bring any with the 2nd pizza - which they had plenty of time to deliver and should have been on the table.  We had asked for parmesan cheese and crushed pepper and didn't get it until we were half done with the pizza (we were extra hungry due to all the waiting).  When asked if we would be compensated we got 10% off the bill......A small gesture would have gone a long way.  Free drinks or an appetizer or dessert would have been nice.  It is disappointing when I see that another patron had their meal comped when they made an error.  Pizza was good but in no way worth this behavior.  The server then tried to make small talk when delivering the bill.  We were so not in the mood. It felt like because it's a tourist town they don't care about customer service.  However people talk, we plan to return to Solvang but definitely won't go there.  When I shared this experience with others they were outraged and surprised the meal was not comped.",1 star rating,Joyce W.

11/17/2015,"Torrance, CA","OH BOY! What a place...Upon walking in this place seemed promising. The layout of it is pretty cool. There are different dining areas: one for the locals with a bar and area for live music to play, filled with patrons aged between after-college and before-kids; one for people who prefer a quiet, more reserved atmosphere, and an outdoor dining area with string lights and a romantic atmosphere. We opted for the bar/dining area to keep our energy up.Once seated we were greeted my our waiter who seemed a bit frazzled and rushed. He took our drink order, returned with our drinks in a reasonable amount of time, and then took our order. We ordered the Danish Meatball Sandwich and the Danish Burger. The Danish Meatball Sandwich was very good while the Danish Burger took a lot of effort to finish. It had this sauce that they call ""Danish Mustard"" on it but closely resembled the Russian/Italian dressing served with our salad (more on that in the next paragraph). It was too acidic and vinegary to complement the Pork/Veal patty. Lingonberry is an ingredient on the burger and would best complement the burger as a Lingonberry Mayo or if served with Lingonberry alone, accompany it with a chipotle aioli sauce. It was far, far from my favorite burger ever.At last, 3 stars also includes the fact that we had to ask for the dressing 4 times! Three times from our waiter and once more from an assisting waiter. At first, Russian dressing was ordered and the waiter didn't comment. The second time the assisting waiter didn't know what it was so we said Italian dressing. Then, the original waiter asked what we wanted again and seemed confused... he kept saying ""Thousand?"". It was equally frustrating when we realized, after receiving our food, that as long as we had to wait for dressing we had to ask them for utensils. I wasn't hopeful,... when I walked in to the place I heard a passing waitress say they were out of utensils :/Ah, well, it was still a fun place to sit and gawk at the unusual patrons. Better luck next time...",3 star rating,Denise D.
8/14/2015,"San Diego, CA","One of the few places in the area open later into the evening - plus, full bar (if you can handle drinking more after a day wine tasting.) We actually came here two nights for food because we could walk and weren't in the mood for anything super fancy.I had a burger, lettuce wrapped (it was really nice that the server offered to do this when I asked for no bun) and it was delicious. The previous day we split a prime rib, add bleu cheese, and that was fantastic too. My husband couldn't eat all of his ""half"" though (I did the cutting, so don't tell him, but it was more like 3/4 and 1/4) which would have been fine if we had a fridge or something to store it in, but alas we had to let it go away.We're sort of beer nerds (for proof see my beer oriented list) so we weren't sure what to expect but knew that SBC had recently won gold for it's pale ale at the SD International Beer Fest so it couldn't be all that bad. And we were pleasantly surprised by their choices. I don't think the brown/red were as good as Fig Mountain, but they were respectable and drinkable.

7/21/2015,"San Francisco, CA","After a long day of driving, all we wanted was some comfort food and Solvang Brewing Company offers just that. Located on the main street of town, Solvang Brewing Company offers burgers, sandwiches, salads, pastas and also offers beer sampling and wine tasting.I ordered the tap room burger with fries ($12.95) which was made to order with pepper bacon and house sauce. The burger was juicy and flavorful and I really liked the bacon. It's a lot of food so come hungry. My mom and sister ordered a caesar salad ($11.95) and the beef stroganoff ($16.95). I'm not usually a fan of beef stroganoff but I liked this one. We also ordered a slice of their mud pie ($8.95) for dessert and it was basically frozen. I'm not sure if it's meant to come that way but it was insanely difficult to eat; I took a couple bites and that was it for me. I will say that the oreo crust was the best part about it.Service was great - our server Brandon checked on us often and made sure we had refills. All our food came out in a timely manner and overall it was a great dinner.If you're looking for some comfort food, Solvang Brewing Company is a solid option.",4 star rating,Stephanie C.

My wife waited 40 minutes for chicken wings, carnitas tacos, grilled chicken and vegetables. They forgot half of our order and offered zero concessions . The place is terrible in my opinion.",1 star rating,Bugume G.

1/25/2016,"Goleta, CA","One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. We were sat in the bar so it was a little loud but the atmosphere was okay. The servers friendly. About my only complaint is the servers don't seem to give the customers the right of way when walking...seems like every time I walked past a server (when I walked in, when I left and then returned to use the restroom before leaving) i crossed paths with a server determined to continue on their path rather than let me pass first. Most restaurants I have gone too always yield to the customer.",4 star rating,Tq G.

7/3/2017,"Simi Valley, CA","Extremely under par establishment. Unfriendly bartender, who over serves patrons. My entire party was harnessed by a certain intoxicated/over served patron who happens to be a ""regular."" I felt uncomfortable ordering a beverage at the bar so I asked my husband to order me a beer while my friend and I waited outside. The next thing we know, the intoxicated patron and my husband are being escorted out of the bar. The patron punched my husband in the genitals and all the bartender claimed to have seen is my husband defend himself. This was a horrible experience for my entire party. This establishment needs to train their bartenders to stop over serving patrons that are touching, groping, and punching people at the bar. I definitely will not be back to Solvang Brewing.",1 star rating,Nicole W.

4/4/2019,"Montebello, CA","This was the only place open late in this little sleepy town. My husband had just completed a 200 mile bicycle ride, he took his time getting showered up so we were unable to attend the dinner that was put on by the event planners. We drove A couple of circles around Solvang and ended up at this bar. The music was lively so we thought this is the place to be. As soon as we walked in we or toward the dining room had just closed but were directed into the bar area where we could order food. It was packed, We did not have to wait terribly long to place our food order at the bar which was a burger, some hot wings, onion rings, beer = $51+; I checked the bill and noticed that the bartender had incorrectly ordered a dozen wings, we asked for 6. When we pointed it out, she was not exactly happy about correcting it and gave us this look but changed it. Everything looked fine when the food was served, my husband's burger was actually really good, pretty big and hearty, my wings were good too.  I dunked my onion rings in the ranch dressing; 2nd one in, I noticed a wavy blond hair in it! My hair is brown. Thank goodness I hadn't put my wings in there yet. I immediately walked back to the bar with the onion ring and container of dressing to show the bartender that took our order. She looked like, oh!! But didn't offer an apology or another dressing, nothing. (By the way, she had dark hair too.). I just walked back to our table; didn't make a fuss with a manager; didn't feel like much would happen.They honestly were more interested in selling drinks at the bar.  It was late and we just needed to leave. So instead of addressing it, I am writing this review.  If you order anything that has ranch dressing, you might want to run a fork through it 1st . If ever back in Solvang, will make sure we get to a restaurant before 9 pm or leave the city.  The band was really good; guys we're older but they could jam.",2 star rating,Jeannie D.
11/22/2015,"Brookline, NH","We had a good meal here last night, starting with fried pickles, and sausage trio. Both arrived quickly and were quite tasty. Good selection of beer which you can have by the pint or stein! Dining available in 2 different bars, outside or in the dining room. 2 different entries were open when we arrived so 2 hostess stations were not working in synch. By the time.we left, they had closed up 1 doorway so it seemed to have been smoothed out. We only ordered 1 meal - danish meatballs- which were tasty in the pork gravy. Took most ho.me as we were pretty full. Service was friendly and quick. The only suggestion would be to slow down a bit. Asked if dessert was wanted before meal was even half finished.",3 star rating,Christine C.
3/26/2018,"TX, TX","Beer was pretty good. We had the Winter lager, Blue eyed blonde, session and Oatmeal Stout. Food was standard pub food. We had the pretzel appetizer, french onion soup and pastrami sandwich. The pretzel was a little undercooked and doughy, but the dips were good. The pastrami was dry as was the bread it was on. They jave a kids menu. My son liked the cheeseburger. The atmosphere reminded me of a European style pub, which fit in Solvang.

9/16/2018,"Goleta, CA","We stopped in here for lunch and beer, despite being concerned by the three-and-a-half star rating on Yelp. We ordered a beer first, and the wings, to kick things off. The beer was fresh and tasty and the spice level on the wings did not disappoint. The main course (burgers) took longer than normal, however, given that this is a tourist town on a Sunday during lunchtime and when crawling with tourists and busy with large parties, it was understandable and when the food arrived it was well worth the wait. My husband's burger and fries were excellent, and my hamburger wrap was very well-done. My burger was more well-presented and tasty than I have received in many other places. Solid four stars and we will definitely return.",4 star rating,Laurie G.

Amazing quality food, we ordered the sausage sampler, open face lox Danish sandwiches, jaeger schnitzel and aebleskivers, all great! My boyfriend tried all 3 beers from the windmill plus the 1547 and he loved each of them.

My wife and I went for dessert, and me of course for the beers. I tried a Raspberry Wheat, Dansk Amber, 1547 Brown Ale, and Odin's Stout. All their beers were just mediocre, my favorite probably being the stout. We had the Stout Chocolate Brownie and Creme Brûlée for dessert. The Creme Brûlée was actually quite good, the chocolate cake tasted store bought, but was plated nicely with a yummy ""Stout"" sauce. Inside was kind of old and worn looking. A few burgers walked by us and looked really good, so maybe will be back to try one?",3 star rating,Jeremii B.

3/31/2014,"La Habra, CA","The food at the Solvang Brewing company was very good but super over priced. My burger cost $13. The ingredients we fresh and prepared nice but there was nothing about it that made it so expensive. I have paid $6 for a burger in la Habra that was just as good (if not more flavorful - check out GBurger). We also order some fries as a started ($6) and I couldn't believe the little handful of fries the brought to our table. An order of fries is one of the cheapest ways a restaurant can fill up their customers but they were stingy with those two. They also could have suggested ordering two since when we ordered our drinks I order the fries for the table and informed the waitress that we were all starving! The order wasn't even a reasonable starter for two let alone a group of 6. The services in general was terrible. When she greet our table the only information she offered was ""the soup of the day is chicken noodle. Are you ready to order?"" WHAT!? No we just sat down, no we are not ready to order! Also after looking over the menu I realized she could have suggested the sausage platter or some of the other house specials. We didn't come all the way to Solvang for chicken noodle soup! Anyway, it took forever for drinks to arrive. At one point we asked for honey mustard and we got some sort of Dijon. I knew (from yelp reviews) that they had different types of mustard so when we asked for clarification, expecting a description about the mustard, we were told, ""I don't know, I just brought it."" What a lame answer!!! I knew we weren't going to get any feedback so I just asked for some water (which didn't come until a few minutes after our food).Once the food was on the table the the service was non existent. We never were asked how thing were or if we needed anything else, until they brought the check. They also didn't include the yelp check in deal, but the waitress redeemed herself a little on this one, by apologizing and removed a drink from our tab. I think this is another example of a tourist trap. They defiantly were not worried about making returning customers. P.S. The house beers we ok; nothing stood out.",3 star rating,Brittany T.

I decided to do the sausage trio because for being in Solvang, you should experience Danish food. My fiance liked the lemon herb chicken. Our plates were huge and hearty.

However they sat us in the taproom which was very loud. When we checked in, we let the host know we wanted the quietest place they had. The table they gave us was next to the jukebox and by the entrance. I don't think there could have been a louder table. When we asked to be moved to the dining room, our Waiter said he would take care of us and to follow him. As we picked up our drinks he told another couple they could sit at the table we were in the process of leaving. We followed him and he walked into the kitchen and left us standing in the walk way and we were never spoken to again. We ended up putting our drinks down and left.",1 star rating,Daniele S.

I then ordered a diet coke and saw the helper coming with my diet coke and a pitcher of water.. Both of our water glasses were completely empty as it was a warm day.. He put the diet coke down and then turned and walked away with the water pitcher...  I was sure I was on Candid Camera at this point...

The plates are big portions, so if you're not too hungry, I suggest sharing a plate. The appetizers are my favorite, especially the nachos. Great choice. My family and I share these every time we go, which is actually quite frequently. There's a decent selection of beer, you can order a flight if you don't know what to choose. The Harvest Blood is fat! Filled with good little bites and a pretty strong drink, if you're a fan of bloody's, try that. They usually have live music too, which is fun!

And what seemed like thirty, forty min for our food. Our waitress even got our style of fries wrong. And when she didn't fix her error, she continued to ask if we still want the order of fries. Of course we do!! We also asked very nicely for condiments (ex. Ranch, bbq sauce) to only receive an attitude or it forgotten completely.

1/31/2015,"Roseburg, OR","It's so interesting. My friends went here for lunch a few days ago. One of them had a coupon from the Santa Ynez High School, a Pirates Coupon. It gave a 10% discount at Solvang Brewery for ALL Food Purchased, alcohol excluded. My friend gave the coupon with the payment. When the change came back, only one lunch was given the 10% off. The other lunch was at full price. When asked about it, the waitress left to talk to the manager/owner. She came back and said that only one lunch would get the 10% off. Now the coupon didn't say only one person, it said All Food Purchased (one person paid for both). How idiotic and cheap. My friends live locally and said they would not return. They also said that the service there was poor, at best. She did say the food was good. This is the story of The Solvang Brewery since I've been in town for four years. Good food, poor service; very slow and very poorly trained staff, very poorly made beer. Yes, for four years. I feel the owner/management could care less about what kind of service is offered and thrives on out-of-town, one time customers. I've tried Solvang Brewery myself four times and each time I've received poor, indifferent service, twice at a table, twice at the bar. It's a shame to as the potential reputation here could be a great one, as with any restaurant.

I paired with the angus sliders and a side of fries (along with a second glass of the stout). I met up with a friend for lunch and loved how quiet it was.  We could talk without having to yell at each other (at night it might be different) I will go back and try a flight of beer and the fish & chips for sure!!,4 star rating,Samantha C.
7/5/2015,"Murrieta, CA","We opted for water for our family of 5 tonight. We had our glasses filled when we arrived and no one checked on us again to refill after our orders were placed. It was maybe 30-40 minutes later, as food was arriving, that our server brought out a carafe of water. I give her props for that.I had the beef stroganoff. It was OK. There was a peppery or spice taste to it that made it a little more than I liked. It wasn't enough for me to send it back.My wife had the tap room burger. She wanted a burger w/ Blue Cheese, but no bacon. Our server helped us craft the tap room to my wife's liking. The bacon was supposed to come on the side, but it never did. Wife ordered sweet potato fries and they brought out regular fries instead. We had this fixed.The burgers were good. The kids meal cheeseburger was an excellent portion size and the meat did not look like it was from a frozen patty.I'd give three stars, but the staff was not very attentive to us in between the time we ordered and the time the meal arrived, and after the meal arrived and it was time for the check. When they were attentive, the service was good, polite, professional, exactly as expected. I was just surprised we went so long without seeing someone ask how things were or if we needed refills.",2 star rating,Ryan B.

Great look from the outside and definitely drew us in and inside there was great food, service, and beer. They were also very welcoming to us and our 6 month old. We had a flight of all their beers and we were a fan of most of them. We also had their sausage platter appetizer, which was delicious! And very filling.

They all got their meals, but I didn't receive mine. I was surprised because it was just a salad. It should be done first. I asked the server and he said it would just be a few more. minutes and that it was being made now. 15 minutes later, and still nothing. What happened was that he never rung in the order but he didn't say that. The manager later told me and apologized. I've worked customer service. I get it. It happens. But don't lie to me about it. If he had just apologized, I would have been fine. But by the time I got it, everyone else was done eating. 1.5 hour wait for a salad is nuts. But not apology or admitting the mistake was the real issue.",1 star rating,Christina L.

They have allot of burgers and sandwihces for their main dishes. Appetizers run teh gambit from fried onion rings and wings to sushi or mini chimi-chicken chimichangas. The wine selection here isn't worth the effort, but the beer selection is pretty good. Be careful though- a large beer is a full stien! Not an overly romantic place to come kick it, but it's reasonably priced and the patio seating is pretty nice.

O M G, they have the BEST beer I've tasted anywhere!  We regularly go to the different brewing companies from Paso Robles to Santa Barbara and Solvang Brewing Company beats them all!  I recommend the Blue Eyed Blonde, Danske Amber Ale, and the Brown Ale.  My boyfriend loves the IPA's.  Now on to the food...we have never tried any of the dinner entrees cause we always start with beer & appetizers and after that we are stuffed.  The appetizers blew us away too!  The Buffalo Hot Wings are the best I've EVER had...anywhere!  We usually order 3 appetizers, the Buffalo Hot Wings, Shrimp/Tuna Ceviche and either the Carnitas Nachos (huge huge huge) or the Yellowfin Tuna Roll.  Phenomenal food!  We have also tried the Mudd Pie and the Danish Bread Pudding, both delish and enough to feed 2-3 people.  I totally recommend you try this place for just the beer alone, the awesome food is an added bonus and we try to go there 2-3 a month.  You won't be disappointed!  They also have live music which we love too.",5 star rating,Maggie V.

Fried pickles, sausage sampler and stroganoff were all tasty.  I also had a Harvester Bloody Mary (they brought just a plain one over at first as a mistake which Carlos had them remake for me) and it was so so good!!  It took a while for us to get our check (it was getting busy by the time we were getting ready to leave) and we laughed because while we were waiting, a manager asked us if we were waiting for menus.

2/8/2013,"South San Francisco, CA","We were here for the Super Bowl, perhaps not their most typical Sunday afternoon.  Two separate areas, the bar and a much quieter dining room, which was our choice.  We both ordered the Danish Reuben:  marble rye, a thick layer of tender pastrami, red cabbage in place of the usual sauerkraut.  Unfortunately, due to an apparent blunder in the kitchen, the promised Swiss cheese was nowhere in evidence.  Oh, well,  still quite good.  (Anyway, wouldn't something like Maribo cheese have been more ethnically appropriate than Swiss?)  For sides, I had a pretty good potato salad, while my wife went for light, almost fluffy sweet potato fries.  We both had an excellent sausage and chicken posole, topped with shredded lettuce.At half-time we ordered the chipotle chicken wings:  six wings in a fairly tame chipotle barbecue sause, with celery and carrot sticks and ranch dressing.  I tried six of the house beers, all available in six-ounce pours at $1.75:Julefest Ale:  7.5% ABV.  Clear red-brown, light head.  Little aroma for the style.  Intense sweet malt-forward taste, with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla.  Not much hop presence, but some bitterness in the fade.Double Dansk Imperial Amber Ale.  9.7% ABV, 100 IBU, so they claim.  Slightly lighter in color than the Juleale, and a lot more head.  Ethanol definitely shows up in the nose, and as a flavor element.  Intense hoppiness well balanced against a solid malt base.  Long fade.Valhalla IPA  7.0% ABV.  Clear, bright copper color, medium head.  Moderate hop nose.  Intensely hoppy (the variety is Warrior; how appropriate for Valhalla!)  Hops dominate all the way down, with something a bit alkaline showing up at the end, almost like quinine.Odin Stout Ale:  7.0% ABV.  Dark brown with red highlights, less opaque than most stouts.  Medium head.  Slight roast malt nose.  Creamy mouth-feel, with a lot of roast malt flavor balanced by a long hoppy fade.  Coffee and bittersweet chocolate notes; also a hint of bourbon, though they assure me that it is not actually barrel-aged.1547 Brown Ale:  5.6% ABV,  Clear amber-brown, light head.  Aroma slight, mostly malt; surprisingly, considering the low ABV, I picked up a bit of ethanol  in the nose.  Nice malty, ""chewy"" taste, with a hint of chocolate and a long bittersweet fade.Great Dane Pale Ale:  6% ABV.  Golden color, medium head, nose mostly hops.  Rich, well-balanced malt and bittering hops, with something a bit floral or perfumey.  This would make a fine session beer, as well as a good ""training wheels"" brew for those just getting into craft beers.All in all, a solid, competent brewing operation and a quite decent restaurant.",4 star rating,Alan F.

I got the blue eyed blonde heff- very tasty and flavorful.. i love heffs though, it's my go-to drink.Odin- this was a stout.. really good and you can taste the hint of chocolate/coffee after every sip. really good beer but probably bad choice for me as a second drink as it sat heavy on my stomach... but that could be bc I was already stuffed.onion soup: delicious! only complaint here is that there wasn't enoughpretzels w mustard: ehh i could've gone without it. you get three pretzel sticks, a cheese dip and some kind of watery mustard with specks of grainy mustard mixed in it. this was my least favorite dip..wasn't too thrillef with the combos but it sufficed as a snack. not the restaurant's fault- just my preference but try pretzels with grainy mustard we sat outside and waitress was very attentive to us which is why they earned the 4 stars. super friendly staff and all around a great, casual bar if you're in solvang!",4 star rating,Raiza C.

There were two servers in the bar area where we sat. Our busboy immediately gave us waters (yay, busboy!) and shortly there after our server arrived taking our beer and food order. I ordered my faves: the chipotle wings ($13.95) and sweet potato fries ($6.95), and my husband ordered the pork belly tacos ($17.95). We have had both of these foods before and they were excellent. We ordered at 7:40pm and food arrived at 8:20ish. We were commenting how slow it was... First bite of taco: rock hard cold corn tortillas and cold hard pork belly. Not appetizing. My wings were warm but they were fried to a crisp. They were tasty, and I was hungry so I didn't complain. My husband, who never complains, spoke with our server about his tacos. The server apologized and offered to ""heavily discount them since this should never happen."" My husband agreed and asked for fresh tortillas just to be kind to the kitchen, and not have them be frustrated with having to remake the tacos. My husband was okay with the fresh tortillas, but still disappointed since the last time the tacos were amazing. The icing on the cake was that the bill came with no discount, even though the server apologized about the tacos again.

7/15/2019,"Apple Valley, CA","The hostess was dropping F bombs at a customer as we walked in so that didn't start us off with a good impression. The busser was on it with water to the table immediately but beyond that the service was super slow. It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come and take our drink and food order and total over an hour to get our food. You could see other customers looking around with their menus in their hands wondering when the waiter was going to show up. The food was good though, no complaints there. More servers need to be on duty as 1 server for at least 10 tables is a lot which leads to lack of service for the customers. I hope the waiters split tips with the bussers because he was the only one hustling in there. 2 stars for the busser and the food but the long wait especially at the end of the night when you want a quick bite to eat and the inappropriate language by the hostess was unacceptable.",2 star rating,Anisa C.

We're from San Diego so we are familiar with micro breweries and restaurants in this capacity. Walked to an a most empty restaurant. We were greeted by a hostess who seemed to completely hate her job and seemed miserable. We were seated outside. And proceeded to sit there for at least 10-15 minutes with no service or anyone at the very least saying hello. We noticed a server who was working the patio that we are on with three other tables. He never acknowledged us but came back a couple different times to clear plates and mill around. The hostess came by again and we asked who our server was. The server who we'd seen on the patio but had not acknowledged us hears us and goes yeah that's me take it easy I'm really busy OK. From what we had seen in the last 15 minutes he was far from busy, just not good at his job. We then proceeded to get up and walk out as we do not need to be in a restaurant and get attitude like that. Do you not patronize this restaurant. The staff there seems miserable.

11/11/2014,"Huntington Beach, CA","Stopped in for lunch on Saturday with my sis but since the main dining area was closed they directed us to the bar... reaked of the smell of beer. so much I thought maybe they mop with it... we waited for a table to clear and sat down and service was SUPER slow... i asked a waitress who walked by for menus (which were in her hand) and she said she'd be back and walked away without giving me the menus.. wtf? as if that wasn't bad enough, people around us who came after us got their for before us... this place just keeps on getting worse... when they finally brought out our food they brought our appetizer, salad and entree all out at once, it's like they try to do everything wrong.As for the food review, we got the Shrimp ceviche cocktail for appetizer which was missing the guac which our shitty waitress told us after she brought it out.  It also had way too much cumin for my liking.. i don't even think i ever even tasted cumin in ceviche before..  The Ahi Tuna Salad although was delicious.  dressing was yummy and the tuna was fresh.  We shared the tap room burger with grilled onions and that was cooked well and tasted good.  The Salad and Burger are the reason for the 3rd star...",3 star rating,Sylvia K.

Food: Our friends had the Ribeye Steak and Shrimp.They both said, the steak was cooked to perfection. Very tasty. They will come back and have it again. I had the Ale Gourmet Cheese Burger. It was very good The special bun they used however, is to large and it is to much bread ratio to the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly. We order the onion rings. Probably the best we ever had. My wife had the Chicken Caesar Salad. Excellent dressing. She was quite happy with Salad. We also had the French Onion Soup. It was very good and authentic. The Solvang Brewery Beers were excellent. I tried the House Bloody Mary. Probably one of the best I ever had. We will becoming back soon. I would of given a 5 rating, except the menu has changed. Limited amount of Gourmet Burgers and no more Ahi.The Restaurant Menu Prices are a little high. 13 to 15 dollars for a Burger, is to expensive. The quality of the food somewhat makes up for the prices.",4 star rating,Steven B.

We are not a breakfast place and used to have a coffee machine but it kept breaking so they bought a Kuirig and kept forgetting to buy the cups.""  So we skipped dessert.

I told the hostess, as well as a manger, but neither seemed to care. We were expecting the manager to at least put up some resistance when we said we thought it'd be best to leave. He did not.

The bartender was making a Bloody Mary with all the accoutrement (celery, red bell pepper, olives, bacon). She was shoving her hand in the drink to get the items in, her hand would come out dripping. Just use tongs or something.  They had a sign on the inside of the main door that said to use a different door to enter, so every person had to open this door to figure that out.

8/2/2014,"Kailua, HI","I was skeptical going in, especially after reading the more recent reviews claiming how bad it was, but I was extremely surprised how great it was!I got there around 8:30 in the evening after a long day of driving and unpleasant hotel reserving, bad food from previous stops in other cities, headaches, and other things, so I wasn't in the best of moods. Figured Id give it a shot since it was one of the fewer places that are open later. It wasn't that crowded, but there were still people around. As soon as I walked in and stood at the podium, even though no one was there, a ""bus boy"" instantly stopped what he was doing to help seat us. Almost sat at the open bar, but sat near a window for a more private seating with the fiance. The waitress came by soon after with waters and took our drink order. Thanks for 'Jeff K's review on the Danske Amber Ale and the 1547 Brown ale. LOVED them. Especially the 1547 Brown Ale. I should mention that they were actually out on a few of the beers, mainly the wheat, but she let us know before hand.We didnt wait long until she came back to take our order, was almost too soon, if anything - certainly not a bad thing. Our meal only took about 10-15 minutes at the most. I ordered the Prime Hand-Cut steak and oh God, either I've been deprived of great steak(which could be the case, because I've been overseas in a ****** country because of the military for 6 months immediately before this) or this steak was the best I've had in a long time. I had it cooked medium-rare and it came with mashed potatoes and sliced zucchini as a side. My fiance had something called a Pold Pork Sandwich that I normally dont like, but actually really enjoyed. Their french fries are good, too.They had a live band setting up, but didnt start playing until right before we left half an hour later. The first song was ""All Along the Watchtower"" - a Jimi Hendrix cover, but the guitarist did an amazing job at playing the blues. I was yelping nearby/future restaurants when the waitress happened to notice I was using yelp and even gave us a couple dollars off our meal! Great stuff :) Very satisfied, with the meal and the service. Couldn't have been happier.",5 star rating,Nathan S.

We waited for over 45 mins and though space WAS available we were never seated. We ordered beer from the bar inside to pass time and couldn't help but to feel so out of place.

Unfortunately, I must report that the negative reviews are true. Though there were few people dining, the food took a long time to come out, and when it did, we realized two of our orders were wrong. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because we had a friendly server, and because the restaurant itself was nice and clean.

I loved the mustards that came with the sausages- both tasted really fresh. The Smorrebrod was also really fresh and tasty- if you like vinegar you'll like this sandwich. After I nearly finished my beer, one bartender came over and gave me a free pint of the Amber ale- unexpected but definitely appreciated.

7/25/2016,"Las Vegas, NV","I'm not even sure the place is 3 star worthy, and only rating them three based on friendliness of the waiter.  I'm pretty sure molasses uphill in snow would have provided us with a faster dining experience than this spot.  I don't know if on the night we came the dude that helped us was the only waiter and there was only one cook back there, but man, an hour to dish out chicken strips and fries for kids seems a bit crazy. Adult entrees took a bit longer and by the time all was said and done, we were pushing a two hour mark, so if you are traveling with the fam, you can imagine hangry ants in the pants around the table.  If food was at least good and worth the wait, I'd understand. But everything from the carnitas nachos to fish tacos was pretty meh. They were also out of Hef (booo) and the house blond was very underwhelming.

She left and we never seen a waitress again. After sitting there for 15-20 minutes we flagged down a waitress and asked if we could get some drinks and order some food. She said she was done working but we could go to the bar and order our drinks and food. She said we could only get appetizers. We know we we there late but the hostess should have not given us a menu if we could not get anything from it. The waitress did not wait us at all until we flagged her down knowing that if she didn't wait on us right away it would be to late to get any regular menu items.

The Bill came than he asked me if I wanted change  Bill was 25 I gave him a 50. . Thought it was kinda crazy.  The server has no clue. Beware atmosphere was good food was horrible.",1 star rating,Mike R.

1/2/2017,"Goleta, CA","SO DELICIOUS. Went there yesterday with my boyfriend to have a relaxing getaway and since Solvang isn't big on nightlife, it was nice to find somewhere so cozy and welcoming like Solvang Brewing Co. The service was awesome and the staff was very sweet. Their Bloody Mary was a meal in itself, dressed in celery, a generous amount of bacon strips, peppers, and olives. We ordered the beef stroganoff (delicious), sausage sampler (the sauces paired deliciously), and the prime rib which was topped with onions &a blue cheese, making it honestly one of the best prime rib dishes I've had in a while. The atmosphere had a very familiar feel to it. My boyfriend enjoyed their cocktails & I polished everything off with their Valhalla IPA, a great choice on my end! I would 10/10 recommend stopping by this place if you ever find yourself in the cute town of Solvang!!",5 star rating,Sarah J.
8/9/2014,"Oak Hills, CA","My wife and I arrived on a Friday afternoon around 6:00pm. The patio was open seating and it literally was open... Solvang Brewery Co was empty. Initially I was scared I had made a bad choice due to the lack of customers. The outside patio was very relaxing and the waitress was nice, so we decided to brave it out. The sausage sampler is A LOT of food! It was literally a meal itself. By the time my Danish meatballs arrived I was already full.Oddly enough the reason we came here was the biggest letdown, The beer! They were out of the IPA, the amber, blue eyed blonde, and another beer as well but I forgot the name of it. The Windmill and Great Dane Pale Ale were good and my wife liked the raspberry wheat but it's bit upsetting they were out of half their beers. Oh well a good excuse to stop back in the future.FYI - Solvang seems to shut down around 6-7pm, even on a Friday. This is like one of 4 places that remain open until late.",4 star rating,Brent D.
7/10/2012,"Camarillo, CA","We walked in on a whim when we first arrived in Solvang for a nice little getaway trip. There was a live and kind of quirky band (keyboard and upright bass) playing in the Viking Room. For a Sunday night, the place was pretty hoppin'. Every seat at the bar was filled. Our server, Bridget, was a sweetheart. My wife and I got a real good vibe right off the bat because the staff were professional but still real laid back. Our water glasses were never empty (never even had to ask for a refill). The wife got the Blue-Eyed Blond Ale, buffalo wings, and brewer's soft pretzels. I had a little of each and the wings weren't too spicy but just right and the pretzel's were legit. The dips that they came with (one dijon and one cheese) were awesome. Now for mine... I ordered the tap burger, medium-rare and Bridget asked if I wanted sweet potato fries, regular fries, or both. SCORE! ""Uh... both please!"" Next I asked her about a couple different beers. She had a good knowledge on each and after I could't decide, she politely suggested the beer sampling, which included samples of every Solvang Brewing Co. original brew currently on hand (in this case, 8). These weren't the little shot glasses half-brew, half-foam that most places overcharge for. These were 4oz. filled-to-the-brim, $1.50 servings. I highly suggest the Valhalla IPA, Great Dane Pale Ale, 1547 Brown Ale (not Stout), and Dasnke Amber Ale.Overall: Great service, great food, great place. When we come back to Solvang, this will be the first place we stop.P.S. I'd give it 1.5$ if I could.",5 star rating,Jeff K.

8/29/2016,"Santa Clarita, CA","I came here to celebrate my birthday this past weekend and was not pleased at all. It was a beautiful day so my girlfriend and I requested to be seated out on the patio. Even though there were people seated outside, the hostess asked the server if they were still seating people outside. The server looked outside and shook her head, so we were seated inside. After we were sat inside, we saw at least three parties that were seated outside. So instead of spending time and money at this establishment, we decided to order a round of drinks and leave. This was rather disappointing as we would have loved to spend money here on food and delicious brews. We filled out a guest survey, but I highly doubt that it will reach management. I will not be returning here based on the offensive and borderline racist service we received, but would like to be contacted by management to discuss this matter.",1 star rating,Shane Z.

4/1/2014,"San Jose, CA","I first went here in 2012 when I stayed in town for my first Solvang Double Century.  I liked the beers I tried, the food was OK, and the service was decent.  I had heard since then that the place went downhill, several friends checked it out and did not like it.I decided to find out if this was true or not for myself, so I stopped by yet again on my trip to the area for the 2014 Solvang Double Century.Yeah, my friends are crazy.  This place is great.  Most of the beers are very good.  The Valhalla IPA was near overhopped, but still had good balance, flavor, and drinkability.  A great American IPA by my picky standards.  A solid B+, certainly the best IPA I have tried in the area, including Firestone Walker (bleh) and Figueroa Mountain Brewing (also good).  We also tried the Great Dane Pale Ale, a pretty good Pale, rather smooth, not too hoppy, interesting cheerful aftertaste.  The Blue Eyed Blonde was a great tasting light in color beer, full of taste but not bitter or bitey by any means.The only beer I tried that I was not a fan of was the Jules Ale, but it was already pretty out of season.  A warm March afternoon this winter brew just didn't fit the palate.  On a cold December evening it would probably be wonderful.  The food:  I only eat red meat every now and then, so I ordered the Portobello Mushroom burger.  Just so you know, this is a regular beef burger with a Portobello Mushroom inserted.  That being said, it was one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Seriously.  Absolutely wonderful.Overall, I love this place.  Definitely a must hit up for any trip to the area.  Great for lunch or dinner.  I noticed they were open for breakfast as well.  Maybe next year...",5 star rating,Erik D.

8/12/2018,"Pasadena, CA","Ate here on a Sunday evening during the summer  and we were very impressed with the servers. Because as we were waiting to be seated they asked us if we were comfortable and brought ice water. This was a very good choice for a sit down meal that was not pretentious or stuffy. Patio is the place to sit on the weekend unless you like homegrown talent at 110 decibels  if you have a good sense of humor you can pretend the air conditioner overflow pipes at the far corner is a ""water feature"". our server, Carlos was very attentive and remembered all our requests. Has craft beer, we really enjoyed the Valhalla IPA. Sharp hop flavor with flowery after bite. Onion rings are excellent. Onion has been either soaked or precooked so not hard or too hot. So these are perfect. Wedge salad is extra good. Dressing is very well done with hint of sweetness and real danish blue cheese. Fresh lettuce red onion and tomato. I skipped the bacon but hubby liked it.  Fish tacos Are great. Lots of food so easy to split and have plenty to eat. You will still have room for dessert if you do share the entree and salad.

We were greeted by a server and as he was about to help us the host shows up and seats us down. She informs us about the soup of the day which I thought was odd since she left us pretty quickly plus isn't it the server's job to tell customers about food? I don't know it just seems random & out of place. Guests can either sit at the bar area (completely separate room) or the dining room. The dining room decor was nice but very dark. There's also a huge TV and a fireplace. Our server didn't give us adequate time to explore the menu that I felt rushed. He literally asked us if we were ready to order 3x within a 7 minute period since we got seated! I finally just ordered the French onion soup so he would stop harassing us. We got beer samplers and the raspberry wheat was pretty good. We also got onion rings, salad, onion soup which was just ok.

Upon arrival, the hostess told us the wait would be about 15-20 min...no biggie! Decided to grab a beer at the bar and as soon as we asked the bartender for a beer, she started to look annoyed. I thought...ok, maybe she's having a bad day? There was a customer at the bar that began staring and looked at us from head to toe. Then all of a sudden, she grabbed her box of food and purse and brought it closer to her thinking we were going to do something. We may be from L.A. and Latino, why would we do that? Anyways, from there on out, the vibe was completely bad. As soon as we saw a table outside became open, we took and asked the hostess if we can take it...she said ""ok"". Fifteen minutes passed by, not one server thought to come and clean the table so we could order and sit. The hostess finally came out to our table and handed us some menus without the table even clean and we said: ""no thanks, we are going to leave"". No apology or anything. It's clear to me that this ""brewery"" has bad service and anyone from the city is going to be discriminated against.

Both were delish! The soup was very authentic and I had no qualms with the wings either. My friends ordered the beef stroganoff (which I've never, ever had) and the pastrami sandwich. I must say both were fantastic. The beef stroganoff was made with Fetticini and not egg noodles and lacked a little salt but still really good and the pastrami sandwich was probably the best I've ever had.

As we were going we heard one of the waitresses say to our waiter, ""the lady at table 5 says she's only waiting 10 more minutes, then she is leaving."" Based on that comment and other reviews, it's obvious this place has an ongoing time management issue.I see from another review that an employee felt the need to attack a Yelper here for calling them out on their lag issues.

3/28/2012,"Goodyear, AZ","Solvang is a sleepy little town, at least Sunday through Thursday, with most eateries closing around a shocking 8:00pm. My husband and I rolled into Solvang Brewing Co. after a long drive up from LA -- mostly because it was pretty much the only place open at the time. A quick yelp check told me that the ahi burger was not to be missed, and despite being from Hawaii and having rather high standards for ahi, I decided to give it a go. And I wasn't disappointed! It was awesome, and so was my husband's sausage trio with sauces AND a delicious soft pretzel! The beer was also tasty - we tried the IPA, the black ale, and one of their seasonal brews that was rather fruity and delicious. The service leaves something to be desired, but the food made up for it - and as a result, we happily visited several more times during our stay.",4 star rating,Kate R.
5/19/2018,"Beaumont, CA","Super disappointing. Waiter was nice enough but extremely hands off. I think this is my first review ever on yelp that is not a 5 star. Had to wave the server down to order drinks, then half the drinks were forgotten. Had to wave server down for appetizer and soup order. Then the soup was forgotten. He never took meal order and after sitting for at least 20 minutes and not paying attention to us trying to politely call him over, we finally got his attention. Then when it came time to pay, he never came back to get the check. Had to walk the check over to the hostess. Then it took another 10+ minutes to get our check back and that was only after having to walk back to get it. Each time I walked over to find our server he was huddled in a group of servers behind the hostess stand talking and ignoring his tables. I totally understand if it was busy, I'm an extremely patient and understanding person, but there was only like 3 or 4 other tables seated inside the brewery. I'm giving this place two stars because the busser was really kind (he brought us our drinks etc) and the food was pretty good. Service extremely lacked. Not worth the prices imo.",2 star rating,Kristy K.
12/23/2014,"Berkeley, CA","Searching for a dog friendly restaurant to bring two little dogs during a vacation led us to this place for lunch.First impressions were not good, it was open seating, about 50% occupancy, but there was no wait staff in sight for several minutes. However, when one did come over, she was pretty nice and courteous.We ordered a Reuben sandwich, a chicken taco soup, and a 34oz stein of stout beer to share. The Reuben sandwich was pretty darn good--sweet and savory filling with crispy toasted rye bread. The taco soup was also good, though surprisingly spicy. And the huge stein of 7.3% alcohol beer probably made the slower service more bearable.Overall, it was a good experience for lunch in Solvang if you have pups with you.",4 star rating,Johanes S.
4/9/2018,"Woodland Hills, CA","This place has literally the best burgers I've ever had in my life! (Not exaggerating) My boyfriend and I rode our motorcycles up to solvang for saint Patrick's day and boy was it busy at every restaurant! When I first saw this place on yelp I almost overlooked it because it only had 3 stars. I pretty much take everyone else's word and will skip over a place if it's rated under 4 stars. We were hungry though and since this is a tourist town I know people can get snotty and post bad reviews if they aren't waited on like royalty. My personal experience here though was amazing. Waitress came right over after we were seated and of course we needed a minute since we were first timers but as soon as we were ready she was back and we placed our orders. I think we maybe waited 15mins before our food was out but we were happy with our green beers keeping us company til they arrived. And the burgers did not disappoint one bit, super juicy and seasoned to perfection! I can't recall the name of the one I had but you can bet whenever I come back to solvang you will find me here! So if your craving some good beer and amazing burgers check this place out! They even give you a side pickle YUM!",5 star rating,Stephanie W.

Asked what his specialty drink is, he pointed to the menu and said, ""I make that stuff on the list.""

1/25/2018,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA","We came here for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday/babymoon trip. We ordered 2 appetizers and 1 special 3 course meal (it was restaurant week). It took over an hour since we walked in the restaurant to receive all the food. First of all, I hardly saw our server to be able to get his attention. And when I saw him, I kept asking the server what's going on with our order, instead of him apologizing, he kept giving us the excuses. We had to ask so many times that we had not received The 3rd course, which was creme brulee. but when he brought it, it was a different desert, and told us that creme brulee was out. He could have told us before we ordered our food! I was pretty upset by the time we were done. I used to be a server, if something like this happens, I would try to talk to manager and compensate something. But he didn't. So we asked to speak to the manager. Actually the owner came out to apologize, and gave is 50% off the bill. The owner was nice (finally someone was nice, not the server...) I wish we did not need to go through such a frustrating experience. The food wasn't terrible, it was ok. But I will never come back here again.",1 star rating,E M.

Apparently the hostess was busy or not working or Some thing but he would be happy to help us. He went out of his way to find us comfortable seating. He knew through experience that we were two 30something women in a bar/pub wanting nothing more than food, drink and conversation between the two of us. Seating us close enough to the bar that he would be able to take our order but not so close as to be bothered by other customers. Between cranking out the drinks for everyone in the bar he got us menus, our Hand poured drinks delivered, our orders taken And taken right mind you. On the kitchens end, You can tell they are either understaffed or undertrained because that would be the only downfall, how long it took to get our food.

There was a fly buzzing around us the whole time, and there was all kinds of hair along the wall by the window where we were sitting. We also got a Greek chicken salad with the chicken on the side. The chicken was supposed to be my sons dinner and did t come out until we were ready for the check which also took forever. We had a pissed off toddler and stomach aches after leaving...

1/24/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","**Ambiance: 2-3 stars...charming, but too dark inside. When you leave the restaurant, you feel like you were in a cave because it seems extremely bright outside. **Service & Management: 2. They seemed frequently clueless and disorganized. The hostess wasn't at the front and the stray employees seemed confused about what to do with the two parties waiting for tables. Finally someone who wasn't the hostess seated us, and explained the specials. Our waiter finally came and again told us about the specials, too, but he seemed having trouble reciting them from memory. He also seemed stressed, probably because he appeared to be serving all the tables. The table runner brought our appetizer while the waiter was talking to us, which was awkward as well as annoying. We didn't get plates for our soft pretzel appetizer (the highlight of our meal), and we had to ask for them. The waiter took so long to bring the check that we had to ask twice for it. **Food: 1. Everyone in my party was disappointed. Portions were huge and the food wasn't worth taking home. I was extremely disappointed in my Danish Reuben - - it was too sweet and tart, which are two flavors that should NEVER describe a Reuben. Ew. The bread was extremely greasy. I squeezed the bread to see just how greasy, and oil got all over my hands and dripped on the plate. Too much sauce was in the sandwich, too, so eating it was unpleasant, embarrassing, and probably gross to watch lol. Not good. I had about 4-5 bites and didn't even make a dent in the huge sandwich.

Not bad, allows you to try each of the beers and decide which one you want.  Our server was friendly and very attentive.  The place was humming in the bar area but the dining area was pretty relaxed, and sat us right away when we walked in around 8:30 pm. Our food was good, but the Burger I got, the bottom part of the bun got soggy and fell apart and had to eat it with a fork after that.

It was kind of full but few big tables were almost done with their meals by the time we were seated. We were ready to order because we had had time enough while waiting for a table,  so as soon as the waiter came we order the drinks and the food (2 appetizers). We got the drinks (2 waters and 1 beer) pretty soon. But we waited during one whole hour for the sausage sample (3 sausages that were just OK) and some chicken fingers that probably were frozen. Moreover, they were run out of French fries, sweet potato fries,  and onion rings... The waiter told that about 40 minutes after we order the food. Then, they substituted our fries for chicken soup, that it was the best part of the dinner. By that point we were so disappointed that we didn't even try the desserts.

5/28/2019,"Helendale, CA","Highly recommend NOT spending one red cent at this establishment.  My party of 4 waited over 35 minutes to be seated in the dining area - oddly enough, there were several open tables in dining area as well as bar.  Took an additional 15 minutes to place a simple appetizer and beverage order and another 40 minutes to receive nachos, pretzels and sausages - not complicated  - and they were Ok, nothing outstanding.  During our wait, we only received 2 of the 4 glasses of water and asked a few times how much longer - each response was that the food (and water) will soon be done and served.  When we finished, we had to flag our server for our bill.  We politely asked if there were any compensation for the absurd amount of waiting.  We received a curt response that this was a normal wait time.  We then asked for the manager at which point, the server's original ""curt"" reply became even more ""curt"" as she declared she was the manager, and ""NO - there would be NO compensation"".  Awesome.  We thanked her politely and paid the bill - sans tip, as in most businesses ""management"" is ""salary"" and exempt from customer or vendor compensation"".  Don't get me wrong - this woman would've been tipped handsomely, even if compensation wasn't allowed,  if she just wasn't so ""curt"".   Sooo, unless you want mediocre food with minimal attention and a curt attitude, don't go here.  Lots of better customer friendly venues deeper in the village that would welcome you and your money.

6/26/2013,"Jamaica, Queens, NY","If I could give them a NEGATIVE Star I wouldThere is rule in the restaurant industry that is taught and that is ""No matter how good your food may taste, if your customer service is terrible, then so will your food"".  There will be times when you will have people waiting for a table, which is normal and understandable, but NEVER seat your customer if you do not have the ability to service them.  I went with a group of friends on a holiday weekend and it was crowded as expected. The problem was that they said they could not seat a large group of 9. So we agreed to sit in two groups (husbands in one room wives in another). That should have been our indicator to run for the hills. The hostess kindly informed us that although we would be seated our order could not be taken for 20-30 minutes.  Seems odd right...""maybe its a Solvang thing"" Have people sit let them order lots drinks and hope they don't complain about CRAPPY service.The waitress proceeded to take our order (only soup salad burgers  and chicken tenders) This should not take long right? WRONG! We waited over 40 minutes... meanwhile our other party was finished with their meal. We asked about our food and response we received was incredible. How dare we ask about our food...Now imagine the most dismissive attitude you can receive and now multiply that by 100 and that would describe the managers attitude as well.

12/27/2016,"Redondo Beach, CA","The place is nice and cozy, with a big fireplace, but the food is pretty average. Pub food. I guess that's the purpose of this premise anyway. Everything tasted ok and the dishes were very big - so that's a plus. The best part of the meal was the mashed potatoes.

5/17/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Really not good.  Bad food - the stroganff was gristly and fatty and dry.  The service was so bad, so so bad from start (hostess was rude) to finish multiple waiters, no drink orders for 15 minutes after sitting down, check took forever, and the place was 1/2 empty on a Sat night.  Even with so many empty tables the hostess was telling people it was a 1 hr wait.  There were clearly NOT reservations for the tables because we were there from 8-10 pm and no one was sat at the empty tables during the entire time.  They are clearly suffering from poor management etc.  I'm a local and I will certainly not be bringing family, friends or colleagues to this place.  I hope they read this and try to make changes because the atmosphere and really cool building is being wasted.  At the very least change the management.... please.If you're looking for good beer - save yourself time and go to Figueroa Mountain in Buellton or Los Olivos.  Really really really good strong flavorful beer.Looking for good food (and the waitress was sending people over to this place because of the ridiculous wait time), there's an Irish Pub in town with great food and atmosphere.  Which by the way they should learn from because the service at the Irish place is outstanding!  My ultimate recommendation: Management needs to be changed - as you can see by the many 1 star reviews.  And the kitchen staff/menu need a huge overhaul and training.  The servers are CLEARLY not trained as waitstaff.  Of note:  I am in customer service, as was a waiter and manager on duty of several 4 star restaurants in Orange County and I would NEVER stand for this type of situation.  Hands down.",1 star rating,Jennifer P.

Came in around 1030 for dessert and a beer because this is pretty much the only place in Solvang open after 9 on a weekday. Was busy, but not super crowded. Sat at one of the tables in the bar area and waited for someone to come help me. And waited, and waited, and waited. I was there almost 45 minutes, and no one working so much as looked at me. At least there was decent live music, but there's really no excuse to not come by in that period of time.  It did seem like only people at the bar were getting any service, but if you have tables, why not take care of them?

1/7/2016,"Wellington, FL","Loved my dining and drinking experience at this local brew pub.  We came on a weeknight (Wednesday I believe) for dinner and drinks after work. We were told there was a 30-40 min wait, so our group decided to grab a drink at the bar, some fries to nibble on and head to the pool table area.  There was one pool table that was currently occupied, so we settled in on playing arcade style games. Before we could finish our fries and pints the table was ready (10 mins max). The food was delicious, the beer was great, the staff were warm and friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and charming. At 9 pm, a lively local band played several songs and then opened the stage for open mic night. Don't be fooled though, this was not your average karaoke. Everyone that sang/played appeared to be semi professional.  Perhaps it's a place to gain some experience before heading to LA.  Overall and very enjoyable evening.",4 star rating,Marilyn C.

4/2/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","I wrote a two star review on this place.   Had some compliments as well as critisism... What I wrote was 100% true and accurate to what I felt about the place.  I recieved a letter threatening me with a lawsuit if I didn't remove my review within 24 hours.  I complied.  Here is the letter that I recieved from the owner:  Hello Douglas, I hope this letter finds you well, I am sorry to hear you believe you became unwell after eating at my establishment. I can assure you this is not the case! I would like to resolve this concern as well as the inaccurate statement you left about my business. Had you verbally defamed our establishment without proof of cause, it would have been punitive. However, since you decided to write it as well as promote a different local business in the same breath; you have now committed slander without proof. I take matters like this extremely serious!! I hope you can understand where I am coming from. Imagine someone threatening the integrity of your business or livelihood. It is one thing to complain about service, food temp, etc. It is a completely different situation when you unreservedly advise all public do not eat at our place as it is a health risk! YOU BETTER HAVE SOME REALLY STRONG PROOF BEFORE YOU CANDIDLY ATTEMPT TO DESTROY MY BUSINESS! My wife and I currently employee over 62 people who would otherwise be unemployed! My wife's family are also all local business owners who settled in Solvang over 100 years ago. I am sure you would not feel good about destroying over 62 jobs. I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that my wife and I are productive contributors to society! So, it is extremely disheartening when we are not afforded the opportunity to repair or improve with a helpful concern or statement to management or owners before publicly defaming our business. I hope you did see a doctor, if you were as ill as you described.  We held a meal for 42 attorneys that same day, many whom ate exactly what you had. I still have their receipt copies for all their meals. Not a single person complained of any food borne illnesses besides you out of over 700 guests that day? Do you not find that strange? If we were serving a bad product don't you think at least one other person would have became ill?  My hope from this letter is that I can speak to reason with you and for you to understand I do not mean any direct insult to you. I am hoping you are a reasonable person and can hear my plead for reconsideration. Unfortunately, if I cannot talk reasoning to you, you will leave me little recourse other than to protect my livelihood, my employee's jobs and my business. We have served over 11,000 guests in the three years and never has any person made a statement of illness from our product. We have passed every health inspection with flying colors and we keep an extremely sanitary establishment and kitchen!! If we cannot mediate this issue between the two of us, I will by whatever means necessary file a law suit for defamation and denouncement without proof of cause, destruction and loss of earnings. This is not a threat it is my only recourse if you do not remove this statement which obstructs my business.  I can accept when something is tangible, seen, proven or tested, however I will not except this outright assumption on where you became ill from something you ate without true proof of cause. There is absolutely no way we are the only place you ate in two days time. This is not an intimidation; it is a necessity of the era. The world wide web and today's technology has given to many populace the ability to vent or state inaccuracies that have the ability to truly hurt or devastate business unfoundedly without proper tact. For this reason my only recourse is communication or legal defense. I truly hope you do not take this personal as I am a reasonable person. However, I must take it personal as I have jobs a business and livelihoods to protect.  Please remove your comment within 24 hours unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you became ill at my establishment or immediate legal recourse will follow.

8/14/2013,"Mansfield, MA","Stopped in to Solvang brewing company after a long drive down Rt.1 from Monterey.  Plenty of open tables at 6:30pm on a Wednesday, so no problem getting seated.  I decided to try the nut brown ale, my wife a sampler of their ""Solvang Session"" and their Imperial Stout.  For reference, I am a craft home brewer - been brewing for over 15 years.  With the explosion of ""brew pubs"" about 12 years ago, it is all too often that the while the local pub brewed beer may be fresh and even good, it's rarely exceptional.  A sip into the nut brown, and I knew the brewer here was of different quality - the nut brown was exceptional.  I also quickly tasted my wife's Imperial Stout which seemed to be spot on for style and ABV - but I can't really give a full opinion on the small sip I had, but my wife was quite happy.  I didn't bother tasting the ""Solvang Session"" after the brown, the brown's finish would have overpowered it, again my wife was happy with it (she had it first, before the stout).The tasting sizes are a great option, especially for those that want to try the stronger beers like the Imperial Stout (7.5% ABV) but don't want to go in for a full pint.  We both ordered the Danish meatballs with red cabbage.  I don't know what danish meatballs are supposed to taste like, these were mildly flavored beef/pork balls about 1.5"" in diameter with similarly flavored gravy.  They were moist and good, but not something I would rave over.  Being unfamiliar with they style - they might have been spot on, I wouldn't know.  My palate would have preferred something a little edgier in the gravy to contrast or enhance the flavor the way a german sauerbraten can be paired with a ginger gravy or salmon with a soy/wasabi sauce.  I do know my red cabbage, which was spot on and reminiscent of my german Oma's.  Nice sweet/sharp flavor, not overcooked and delicious, was quite happy with that.Service: overall just OK.  Waters refilled water several times which was great, but the food took a long time.  My wife and kids resorted to counting games guessing how much longer it would be.  We were just getting ansi and were about to call for someone to check when the food arrived.  Certainly some room for improvement in the kitchen timing.Overall a good experience, we were happy with the food and thrilled with the quality of the beer, my wife summed it up as ""it seems like a good brewer wanted to start a restaurant to highlight his/her beer""  The beer is what shined for us.",4 star rating,Justin P.

5/19/2015,"Fountain Valley, CA","This is my second trip to this location. My first experience was great. We sat down in the restaurant area, I ordered the Ribeye 18oz steak and it came out perfect. Seating was great, food was great and the service was great. So, why the low score?On my second visit, I went to Sulvang Brewing Co. by myself. I told the hostess, party of one. Her response was, that they did not have any room in the restaurant area and it would be an hour wait if I wanted to sit there. I took a peek into the restaurant area and saw one rather large party but I also saw about 7 empty tables. She explained that there was room in the bar so, no big deal, I went to the bar and found a table.There were a few waiters and waitress on the floor and they were servicing a large area so it took about 5 minutes before I could flag someone down. She said she was going to get me a menu but I already knew what I wanted so I ordered the Ribeye once again. At 25 minutes of waiting, the waitress said it would take a few minutes longer. At 35 minutes, a different waitress brought me the check. WHAT!!! I didn't even get my meal! She apologized and left. At 45 minutes of waiting, my food finally arrived. It was the first time I ever thought about leaving a restaurant because the food took so long to come out.The meal was good as always but the wait was horrible. It would explain a little if it was packed but, it was a Monday night and the place was about half full. A 18oz steak is too much for me to eat in one sitting so I asked for a box and even that took a while for the waitress to bring that to me. As I was filling out the tip area, I decided to give the waitress one last chance for a decent tip. I asked for a bag and she pleasantly went to go get one. After sitting about 10 minutes waiting for the bag, it was apparent that she was not going to return. I wrote in the minimum 15% tip and left. Pretty disappointing...",1 star rating,Bruce K.

The wait staff are friendly, however it was a bit busy and getting refills on drinks was a bit tough. My wife and I shared the 18-ounce Ribeye steak and my 5-year old had the Spaghetti. We all enjoyed our food. If you get a salad with your food it comes all bunched on the plate and was not what I was expecting. Potatoes weren't spectacular. Good food, but I wasn't wowed!",3 star rating,Aaron A.

1/7/2011,"Lahaina, HI","GREAT BEER SELECTION!!One thing I love about little wine towns (not that I've been to many) is their individual, locally-driven flair. I didn't try their food, but this place can work out either way... dining or bar-like scene.They have a limited beer list of 12 on draft and 5 are made there. Pretty awesome, right? Here's a few I tried and loved: *Rogue Hazelnut - hazelnut infused, roasty, smooth, and not too heavy. I was in heaven! It's not overwhelming with the hazelnut flavor and was just perfect. Even my non-beer drinking friend liked it. *Unibroue Trois Pistoles ""unibrew twa pistol"" reminded me a lot of Erdinger black beer. Light and crisp on the palate in spite of it's dark color and a little spicy. *Delerium Noel: a golden brown beer slightly fruity and hints of spice. I loved the fact that the bartender knew my taste based off my first selection and was able to recommend new beer to try like she was reading my mind. She was even cool when my friend ordered the Wyder's Pear Cider. The crowd was a little mixed and seemed like a lot of locals hung there. Nobody gave me a hard time, so I'll definitely return to this place again.",4 star rating,Celia C.
8/31/2015,"El Segundo, CA","I'll be honest, I was hesitant to try this place because Yelp rated them with a 3.5 star rating. However, I must say the food was good. I ordered the ahi burger and it was really good. My sister ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger and it was so good. Their craft beers was also delish! If you check in on yelp, you get $1.00 off on their craft beer. Not sure how long the promo will last. Also, the service was great. It wasn't busy so they were all courteous.  I read reviews that service was slow but that could be understandable when this place is super busy. No restaurant can perform 100% when clientele is at its maximum capacity. So I totally recommend this place as a go to stop when traveling on the 101.",5 star rating,Gisella P.

The kids corn dog was giant! You can probably feed 2-3 children with one item off the kids menu. So I'm giving the food 3 stars. I would give this review 5 but the bar was missing a lot of items... Basic scotches they didn't have or tequilas. So that was the only reason I took off two stars. Other than that for food I will definitely be back!,3 star rating,Kareena R.

I went last night, walked in, saw a girl who worked there and said ""Hi! I'm 1 outside."" She was friendly and came over with a menu and shortly after my waitress came and took my order. Everything was good, came out quickly, and the server was friendly. MAYBE EVERYONE COMPLAINING JUST ASSUMED THEY WOULD BE NOTICED WITHOUT EVER CHECKING IN, FROM L.A. MUCH??

My husband and I both loved the Blue Eyed Blonde and had it both nights. My husband also tried a few of the IPAs -  the Valhalla and another with a name I can't remember - but landed back on the Blue Eyed Blonde both nights. I also tried the Pumpkin Ale (a small taste) and while it was good, I didn't think I could drink a whole pint.The food was also really great - my husband had the Ahi burger and the ahi was wonderfully cooked. I had the danish burger (because: Solvang) and while it didn't hold together all that well (because of the lower fat meats) it was really delicious. I also had the sweet potato fries and they were nice and crispy.I'd definitely recommend if you're in Solvang!",4 star rating,Sara S.

It took about 10 minutes (not exaggerating) before anyone even came over to our table for our drink order and that was only after my husband went to ask someone for some help. I would understand if the place was packed and super swamped, but it was a ghost town in there. The server that finally came over to help made zero acknowledge for how long we had been waiting for service and was actually super unfriendly. Luckily, the food was decent, but for a $50 lunch bill for two, I would expect slightly better service than what was provided. Disappointing , strongly recommend spending your money elsewhere.",1 star rating,Vivian M.

I was nervous when we first arrived and I looked at the menu. I am usually very basic in my food choices and everything seemed to be a little ""weird"" for my liking but I ended up ordering the Danish Ruben and I loved it. Now bear in mind, I might only possibly have had pastrami and Swiss cheese once in my life and I definitely had not had rye bread, let alone russian dressing (I requested no cabbage on mine, like I said, very basic palate). Anyway, I took a chance and wound up loving it. My husband had the beef stroganoff and really enjoyed his as well. I even tried it and liked it. We also had the onion rings as an appetizer and creme brûlée as a dessert. Everything was perfect. If you are in Solvang you should definitely give this place a try.",5 star rating,K F.

I wondered why we were the only ones told to order from the bar and wait.  After waiting all this time, the bartender says to us ""Your order is 86'd.  We ran out of food""  Not fully knowing what ""86"" means, we later googled it and it means ""REFUSAL OF SERVICE or RAN OUT OF FOOD"".  What the????  They ran out of food when the late night menu is offered from 10 pm to midnight? It was only 10:30 pm,...... I think not!!  The bartender returned our money without offering any alternative choice from the menu.  All food in the whole restaurant ran out.....right?!?!  or WAS IT BECAUSE WE WERE ASIAN??  I can only come to this conclusion after reading other asian yelpers having a similar experience here.  The white, shaved head, middle aged bartender never apologized and we left.  This kind of discrimiation is UNACCEPTABLE!!   I cannot stress enough to AVOID this place, especially if you are not white!  I strongly urge you not to patronize here if you support civil rights.We are telling all our friends and relatives about this rude and racist place!",1 star rating,Lisa K.

The busser was the greatest part of all. Our server told us she'd be back with drinks and SECONDS after she walked away, he was there with waters and cups with lids for our kids.

We sat outside with our dog, a gentlmen came out and promptly brought him a water bowl which I thought was awesome. Our server was very nice, we asked alot of questions about the beer and she was friendly and helpful.The beer was fantastic!! We always drink IPA. We are addicted to hops, it was delicious! Like I said, we are beer snobs, we pretty much live for our hoppy beer and their IPA did not disappoint. It was actually so good we bought a growler and took some home!The food was also fantastic! We had an order of fries, a broccoli and beer cheese soup (A-freakin-mazing!) and we shared the Ahi tuna with coconut rice and stirfry veggies. It was absolutely wonderful! The tuna was a huge steak! We were like WOW it caught the server off guard I think she thought we were unhappy by the looks on our faces but we were actually excited! Usually when you order ahi its thin little slices, this was a whole tuna steak. Seasoned to perfection!

9/1/2014,"Escondido, CA","My family and I were in town this past Saturday and we were excited about dining there. It was ideal as we had a very friendly dog and my handicapped brother in a wheelchair, so we took a couple of tables on the patio. There were 16 of us in my family's group and a server informed us that we could move to the other side of the patio to better accommodate us. As we got settled into our new seats, we were approached by a very rude man who informed us he was the manager. He said that we would not be served there and that he didn't want to make a server take care of us and that section of the patio was closed. He did not offer to reseat us or make any accommodations for our large and very hungry party. We were incredibly disappointed that we were all approached in such a rude and unhelpful fashion. The other side of the patio was already full and we were basically told to leave. A large family with a dog and handicapped wheelchair bound young man were refused service and turned away rudely. We will not be going back and are horrified that any establishment would turn away what would have been a very profitable party for them.HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RUDE MANAGER!

You might expect rich flavorful ales; robust ciders (a Viking specialty) manly man stuff.  What you get are low alcohol, thin insipid beers and ales.   And no ciders.  Sheesh. Drank six of 8 house made brews but couldn't bear to taste the last two.  Some of the most mundane ""craft"" brews I've ever had.  (and I've tried near nearly 400 different ones). Even their most robust brew, ""Odin Stout"" (7% alch). was on the whole unremarkable. It was the most interesting thing on the menu, mind, and had an almost interesting coffee flavor finish.  But awful thin, and lacking substance, and not worth ordering again.  Sigh.

11/7/2014,"Riverside, CA",I am giving it a 2 cuz of the beer. It is actually good.We have been coming to Solvang for 3 years now and we always stop by the Brewing Company mainly for a cold beer and watch some kind of football. The first year was great. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and just had a good time. Last year we noticed a different bartender and he wasn't very friendly to my husband. To me he was fine but was short with him. Didn't pay much attention to it but later notice that he wasn't even paying attention to us and asking if we wanted more. Which clearly if you are sitting there watching a game you are. This past visit was the worst. We sat at one of the tables by the bar to watch a game and bartender was a total jerk. Pretty sure it was the same guy from last year. His customer service skills sucked! For that being a tourist spot you would think they would be on him to be nicer and friendlier to the guest. He must be related to someone cuz you could clearly see he was not having it with anyone. Like he didn't want to be there. I even had to write on the tip that it wasn't more due to his horrible attitude and we waited forever for more beer. It was busy so we gave him a few times of no problem. But even the waitress kept apologizing and saying she will check on our beer. I for sure won't be going there next year. Also we met up with a few couples there at the Brewery and they agreed that he had a horrible attitude with everyone. Hope the owner reads YELP so he can see why his business isn't doing too good.,2 star rating,Yolanda V.

We were out there for 2 minutes but the heaters didnt work so we asked to be seated inside they said it would be about 5 minutes and they told us to wait in the waiting room. While in the waiting room there was a disgruntled customer yelling profanities while all of the employees just walked by her and said nothing. We then went back up to the front to tell the hostess and she addressed the situation while she was taking care of the disgruntled customer another one of their drunk customers from the bar told us to ""back up off his jukebox"" that is when we left.

12/17/2013,"Simi Valley, CA","The negative reviews seem to be about the time it takes for the food to come out. Not so with us , but we did go on a chilly Thursday evening. The wife wanted to try it and we'd had a pint in Fitzpatrick's Tavern and I needed an excuse to get out of the cold and into the warm. Place was decorated for Xmas and looked great. Server was extremely friendly and brought a 6 beer sampler pronto. Enjoyed all but one, can't remember the one we disliked but it was cinnamony  and hoppy We ordered 2 appetizers instead of main meals; the buffalo wings which were excellent and the nachos which were absolutely loaded. We couldn't eat a thing after that. The food came in no time at all, so never had the problem that some people were complaining about and it was just starting to get busy as they had karaoke that evening. I wonder if they've sorted that out or we got lucky that night? Anyway will definitely go again though I would like to try the food in Fitzpatricks too",4 star rating,Glenn K.

Obviously she was taking back the beer as she left it on the table and after didn't ask how I was doing anymore. When I received my bill it was still there so without saying anything I paid it and when I asked for my change she only brought the dollar amount didn't say thank you or anything just dropped the bill and walked away.

2/18/2014,"Los Angeles, CA",My boyfriend and I have enjoyed grabbing a beer + grubbing on typical bar food at Solvang Brewing Co but I'm sad to say...after the last two experiences we've had here... we won't be back.  Round 1:About a year ago after having drinks at the bar we were seated at a table for dinner.  Halfway into our meal we were told we'd have to finish up quickly so that the area could be cleared for their band.  In my opinion this should have been brought up prior to us sitting down to eat...Round 2:Feb 2014: After buying a round of drinks we put our name in with the hostess for restaurant seating and were told that the bar area is a complete free-for-all.  After sipping on beers a nice older gentleman told us that he'd be leaving soon and that he wanted us to have his table.  Upon hearing this conversation a waiter told us that a large party would be coming in and that no one could be seated in the section.  Literally a moment after the older gentleman left his table a couple snatched up the spot.   SERIOUSLY?!?!  I immediately brought the issue up with the hostess and received no form of apology.  Beyond frustrated with the situation we ended up walking down the street to pick up a pizza + bottle of champagne which ultimately ended up being a much better dinner than what we would've been served at Solvang Brewing Co...,1 star rating,Emily C.

We ended up just sitting in our cozy booth in the bar area, chatting and people watching all afternoon. We ordered a pint of the Raspberry Wheat once we finished our samples and also tried the pretzel sticks so that we could make it across the street to our hotel upright. haha The pretzel sticks and dipping sauces were great.

3/4/2013,"Concord, CA","My husband and I had a fun time trying all of the beers here. The price for a sample is pretty good for 5 oz - $1.75. I don't usually like dark beers, but I fell in love with the Odin beer. My husband preferred the Valhalla. Both were fantastic. We got the nachos one night - I know half the food in Solvang is pickled and you might thing pickled veggies sound weird, but order them on the side if you're a little nervous - they actually blend in really well! The flavor was similar to guacamole, and the portion was good.On another night, we tried one of the burgers (can't remember which one, but it was all right), the onion soup (pretty good), and the sausage platter (Fantastic!) The latter was a real winner. Some of the sausages in solvang all start tasting the same, but this had a great variety.The waiting staff was excellent, as well. Very friendly and fun.

The only problem is that our drunken nap left us awake and starving at 9:30, a little late for the local fare.  But alas, The Solvang Brewing Company had its lights on, lively music and a table for two!The menu is pretty standard American food with a fun selection of beers on tap (as they should considering their name). I got the fish and chips while my boyfriend ordered their ribeye.  Y-U-M.   Boyfriend would not shut up (well that's not unusual) about how amazing his ribeye was (and he's genuinely a steak snob, so WOW).  But I tasted it and it was absolutely delicious.  My fish and chips were also really good and HUGELY portioned.But the best part was the hospitality.  The owners were working, Steve and Carrie.  They were so friendly and poured us after-hours beers while chatting about the history of the establishment.  The couple gave us a few more complimentary drinks and it was evident how dedicated and hard these two worked on a daily basis (I couldn't help but feel a little guilty sipping lager watching them scrub and overturn heavy chairs.)I'm so glad we slept through our other reservations and ended up at the Solvang Brewing Company.  Say hi to Steve and Carrie for us!!",4 star rating,Leah J.

1/3/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","I would go into a Norse mythology themed review here but considering it's a pretty bad pub that just happens to use Norse mythology in the names of their beer, i'm not going to bother bringing up Great Odin's beard. Having said that, I guess I will just toss it out there that maybe I felt that Loki was playing a bit of a trick on me as it was an interesting concept, but man did those beers feel like a prank. Now don't get me wrong, the beer is pretty bland. But look where you are. You're in Wine country and Danish pastry-ville. If you're focus is beer, the central coast is just all around bad for you and you're better off just making your way north a little and going to Firestone Walker. Solvang Brewing company is there to cleanse your palate of the wine tastings that you'll be doing in these parts. It's a nice change of pace after you've done bottle shops and tasting rooms after tasting rooms. With that said, it seemed that all their beer was just lacking something in each taste. The Valhalla IPA was just alright. It got the job done for being a bitter enough IPA, but the flavors were unbalanced. If this was a sign of what Valhalla was like, I don't think dying in battle would be all that it was cracked up to be. Their Pumpkin beer was probably the better side of the spectrum in taste profiles and my favorite of the half dozen or so tasters I got was Odin Stout. Which had the most redeeming flavor of the whole experience. Though I have to say, their service was pretty lacking. It took a good 15 minutes to get our tasters out. Which seemed like a bit much and besides that, I was in a sort of rush to get to the ostrich farm before it closed. So with generally lacking great beers and bad service why the three stars? Because the taster are $1.50. I mean, a dollar freakin' fifty. How can you really go wrong with that? You can't. Not if you're at all into craft beer. $1.50 is within reason to at least trying it and seeing if you care for it or not. Who knows, maybe they'll improve on their craft and be a much better brewery. And the bad service can be easy to gloss over if you're just looking for a divey type of gastropub. Their nachos did look pretty tasty and I'll probably be back here again when in the area just to try them and to see if they've improved their craft on the craft beer. Maybe they'll get good enough that they'll use Thor's Hammer in the name of their first respectable beer that is worth getting a growler of.",3 star rating,Javier J.

1/20/2012,"Long Beach, CA","My wife and I decide to try this place because it was walking distance from our hotel. When we walked in the host told us we could sit anywhere we wanted to.  We chose a place next to the window so we could look out and see the Christmas lights. The down side to this is we were near the front door and had to see/watch the host throughout dinner.The reason I mention this is this guy could NOT sit still for more than three seconds.  He was constantly walking around the room looking for something to do, but not really doing anything.  Often he was not at the host station when people walked in. He would frequently check his phone for text messages. straighten the menus my picking them up and slamming them down on the table making a startling ""bang"" (this happened 4 or 5 times during dinner).  He was also making a lot of stretching or flexing gestures.  My wife actually changed seats so her back was to the host station this was such a distraction.Our waiter service was good but the meal seemed to take a bit long to come out.  My wife ordered a salad with seared Ahi on it.   The Ahi was good, but it had an orange ginger dressing that was so overpowering the salad was inedible.  I ordered the Ale Brined pork chops.  It was a generous serving although a bit over cooked and a little dry. There was supposed to be some kind of compote or chutney, but that appeared to be missing.  The red cabbage and mashed potatoes were the highlight of my meal.I am quite certain that there are better places to eat in town.",2 star rating,Paul F.

We were not made to feel like we were keeping them there, it was late and no one in the house, maybe they could have closed. Very impressed with service and food was awesome.

9/8/2014,"Santa Ynez, CA","Hmmm...where to begin! I've heard different thing said about this place. A few weeks ago I decided to give this place a try with a couple of friends. I think it was a Saturday night there was live music in the bar area so we looked for an open table and sat down to enjoy the entertainment. We waited patiently to be acknowledged by someone, 15min later we finally had a server come up to us and she took our drink order. 10min later our drinks arrived by then we were hungry and ready to order. The food arrived and it was very tasty I really enjoyed the ahi tuna entree. Food was great but service was hideous. I'm a server myself and I totally understand when servers are busy but the place was not even busy enough to use that excuse. My fiancé and I wanted to give it a second chance. This time we wanted to treat his mom for her birthday. We were a party of ten. It was a last minute dinner and no we didn't have reservations. We were willing to wait for a table to accommodate all of us. I got to the front of the restaurant and the hostess seemed unhappy to be there and she was so unwelcoming. That didn't stop me to ask for a table. As soon as I told her we needed a table for ten people she said sorry there's nothing available. She offered the booths in the lounge but who's going to sit at a booth with a two year old. (Really) I told her how long is the wait and she said I don't know. By then I was really irritated with her because she didn't seem like she was trying to help us or accommodate us. As we were walking about the door a nice gentleman named Jake, said he was going to see what he could do for us and he was extremely welcoming but at the point we we had all lost interest. I guess they weren't interested to make money. Food is good but service is horrible!

I was so looking forward to having a fun dinner at this place after a day of driving from Paso Robles and then hitting a few wineries in the area, but it is one of the worst restaurants I Have been to in a while. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was horrendous! We went at 630 or 7 on a Sunday night.  We had called a head so they had a table for us.  They were full when we got there, but most tables were leaving and they all seemed grumpy -- should have been sign one. So we are seated promptly and my husband and I order a beer-  it took us over TWENTY minutes to get a beer.  Our poor waiter was running around trying desperately to do the best he could, but he said the bar was backed up... I dont know if it was him or the bar, but it should never take 20 minutes for a draft beer ever.  We ordered a burger w soup and fries and the rueben w half sweet potato fries and half normal fries.  Burger was WAY over cooked.  We asked for medium and got well done.  The soup never came, we ended up canceling it half way through our entrees.  The  reuben was actually not bad-  I enjoyed the bread, the slaw and the meat. If I hadn't waited so long, it would have been better.  The sweet potato fries were terrible.  Who would have thought a sweet potato fry could be bad, I wouldn't have thought so, but I had theirs and theirs were bad.  As we were getting ready to leave, this older couple next to us turned to us and said ""excuse me, is it just us or is this place really slow?""  So it wasnt just me being impatience, all the people were getting frustrated and were ready to get out of there.  I am a big micro brewery lover-  especially when they have food - so so bummed this place was so bad.",2 star rating,Danielle G.

My husband had their Viking style steak with melted blue cheese. I tried it and the flavor was incredible. We also had a cup of their soup du jour which was Pesole (not sure of the spelling?) it's a Mexican soup which my husband loves. He said this was one of the best he's ever had, and we're from LA where we have tons of Mexican food restaurants around us.

One of the beers (their amber ale) had either gone bad or perhaps even had an infection. It tasted like a wet bar towel that had sat out overnight. The other beers were just ok. I'm a little bit of a beer geek, and I'm surprised that a brewery like this wouldn't have better beers.I would really like to try it again because I think I may have just hit it on an off day. We went in at 11am, right when they opened, and sat down in the bar area. There were only two tables sat at the time, and one server was working. Within about 20 minutes, that one server had over 10 tables and was going down in flames without any help. It wasn't his fault at all. He was very friendly and apologetic, but we could see that he was literally running from the back to the tables and getting stopped by customers both directions. Management should think about scheduling more staff so that the service is quicker on a holiday weekend.I gave 3 stars because the food was really good, but the beer and the service were severely lacking.",3 star rating,Casey S.
4/8/2017,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Stopped by Solvang Brewing for dinner and to catch the college basketball game. The bartender was super nice, attentive and easy going. She helped us pick out the right beers and made a really good recommendation on which burger to go with. BTW, the burger of choice is the one with bacon on it soooo good. My companion picked a burger made with both meat and pork. If I go back I would pick that patty to go with my bacon burger.",5 star rating,EHB b.
9/15/2015,"San Jose, CA","My sister and I traveled from the Bay Area to spread our moms ashes and decide to go here. We both order the same burger, except I tell her... ""NO TOMATOES AND KETCHUP, I AM EXETREMLY ALLERGIC"".  We get our burgers and by the second bite, I notice I am a TOMATO seed on my finger. So I think, they finally realized i asked for no tomato and took out the tomato they put in. When I spoke to the manager, it seemed like it wasn't a big deal. Needless to say, I had to use my EPI PEN and suffered the trip to spread my moms ashes with my sisters and then spent the next 6 hours in the E.R.  So if you have a food allergy... BECAREFUL.

7/10/2017,"Phelan, CA","This was by far our absolute worst experience at a restaurant ever. Our beer was on the warm side. When we mentioned it to our waiter Brandon his reply was that there was condensation on the glass which means that it is cold. His solution, he brought us some ice. We proceeded to order. Our food arrived except for my son in laws. Since our waiter was no where in site we asked the gentleman that refilled our water to please bring a few sauces for our meals. These never arrived, neither had my son in laws meal. When our waiter finally showed he told us that there was a mix up in the kitchen. He actually said, I do not cook the food. We asked about our sauces. His reply, well you did not ask me  for them. I could go on and on. It was at this point that we asked for the manager. The polite hostess said she would get him. He was working in the back room. The manager came to the table and made excuse after excuse for our waiter and his attitude. Even going so far as to lie and tell us that he had had to leave so he was not there to see what had happened. When my son in laws meal finally arrived we were all finished. Our waiter brought it out and said in a rude manner, I suppose you want this to go? Needless to say, we will not be going back to this eatery any time soon.",1 star rating,Kat S.

Not one is an award-winner, but it's better than most chain ""brewery""-restaurants (like BJs and the like).

8/13/2013,"Glendale, CA","Date of visit: 8/10/13My group of 4 decided to try SBC because we were craving burgers. We called ahead and were told that there was no wait, we could just show up and be seated. We arrived at 7:45pm on a Saturday night, were seated promptly, and then proceeded to wait 10 minutes for some menus. Then, another 10 for some waters. When we finally got our order taken, we were really hoping the kitchen would be faster than the service. We did notice several of the other tables around us glancing around looking for their waitresses/food as well. Not a good sign. When we FINALLY got our food, it was almost 9pm. Yes, it took that long to make some sliders, pasta, frozen french fries, and corn dogs. Nice. When we got our check at 9:15, we requested to speak to a manager about this ridiculousness. We were told ""Sorry, since we opened this new patio area, we've been slammed."" (Note: The patio was COMPLETELY empty at the time) I explained that we patiently waited an hour and a half for our food and that this service was just not acceptable, so he took some money off of our bill, and we were finally able to get out of there. During the course of our meal, we noticed a table get up and leave because they were waiting so long, and also another table getting red in the face looking for a manager. What the heck is going on, SBC? We won't be back. We had tons of food options that night, and sincerely regret this one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 8/14/13Just got a charming ""compliment"" from someone who is obviously an employee of this fine establishment reading:Funny I was there when you ate and you were the one being ridiculous... When you complained that it had been an hour and a half for your food and you were finished eating it had only been 50 minutes since your order had been taken. We have ways of checking these things. The other table had a right to complain, you were looking for a free meal...Wow. For someone who was paying such close attention to my table, why couldn't you have come refilled our waters once or twice? Oh wait, you just dropped a pitcher of water at our table because checking on us would be too much work, I guess. Apparently 50 minutes is an acceptable time frame to be waiting for food, according to you. Also, if you have such ""ways of checking these things,"" surely you would have noticed that we in fact paid for our meal. $60.21 to be exact. I'm also curious as to why other tables get the right to complain. Were they waiting 51 minutes for their food? Help me Bridget N., I don't understand! Anyway, nice try, but my review still stands. Anyone leaving a bad review for SBC on Yelp can probably expect a poorly thought out ""compliment"" from the very charismatic Bridget N.! Have a GREAT day. :)",1 star rating,Trisha T.

8/13/2011,"San Diego, CA","In town for the weekend and saw the ad for a new brewmaster's release event. I am going to be completely honest -- beer was not good. My wife ordered the blonde which was completely flat but tasted decent. I ordered the IPA which was also flat and unfiltered. However, I never really knew if it was really their attempt of an IPA or a mistake because after reading the description as filtered and crisp, it was just the opposite--cloudy, malty, soft, and with little hop character. After dinner we headed to the bar area for more drinks and I was so convinced that IPA was a mistake by the server so I ordered it again and the same beer arrived. They must have connected the wrong keg and nobody noticed all night or they clearly do not know an IPA. I was so confused. A server near the bar took our order and five minutes later she said ""Can you just get your drinks at the bar, I'm too busy."" I was shocked by her. I then ordered myself to save her the sweat of walking ten feet to the bar. The bartender filled my two beers then mischarged my card. Nothing was going right.I was very confused by the whole experience that evening. This establishment has a lot to learn in many aspects.

Omg both sandwich were very good.  My fav was their balsamic vinegar and mustard dressing.  It was really really good. Service was good, probably better than any other restaurant in solvang, I am not sure but many shops in solvang is not like in la. They are not friendly or attentive to customers.  So weird.

Our server/bartender, Mark was very friendly and kept checking on us even though he was busy, and kindly answered our questions, offered suggestions and accommodated our extra requests with a smile. For dessert we enjoyed a freshly baked brownie.  The sports bar atmosphere and casual dining in an open air setting was very pleasant. Our experience was so wonderful, we returned for dinner the following night!Tuesday night, we ordered the St Louis Ribs and SBC Hot Wings with a side of Pub Fries (don't forget to add the garlic and parmesan cheese!), and were blown away by the cheesecake for dessert.  The desserts are definitely the crown in this jewel, but are not on the menu and change daily, so be sure to ask your server.  Again our server, Leah, was terrific, and the place was crowded with locals, which just proves how great they are.  All I can say is WOW!!!",5 star rating,Miriam H.

No menus were provided or utensils (we had to ask for them).  Service was terrible (at least our waitress was) and the food was not great. We ordered a burger and could only eat half. Who messes up on cooking a burger ? I ordered fish n chips. That was also not good.  Fries were cold stale, beer batter on the fish was super oily. Coleslaw had no taste.

7/31/2011,"New Britain, CT","Stopped here for a snack while passing through town. My husband is a big craft beer fan & good beer & good food almost always come in pairs at brewery restaurants. Not the case here. No beers of their own on tap. We wanted a snack & got the ale pretzel thinking it sounded good. I love soft pretzels and eat them frequently & this was, by far, the WORST soft pretzel I've ever eaten. The taste was horrible, including the taste of the salt. It didn't even taste like salt.Now on to the service... When we sat down, there were about 2 or 3 small groups at tables outside and we were the only ones at a table inside (two people were at the bar). Our waitress was only responsible for our table. When she came to take our order, I told her we were just having a snack because we were on a road trip and headed to our next destination. We ordered our drinks and the pretzel. A few minutes later, the bartender brought our drinks over. We then waited, waited, and waited for our pretzel. It was gross so we asked the waitress for our check and then waited, waited, and waited. Two tables came in after we asked for our check and the waitress proceeded to take each table's drink order. She brought the drinks to each table and took their food orders. All while neglecting to bring our check. My husband went to the bartender and asked if she could get our check. She said we had to ask the waitress and he told her he already asked 20 minutes ago so after a 30 minute plus wait to get our check, we were finally able to leave! We almost walked out on the check and I've never considered that before. The place was not busy at all, so there was no excuse. My husband was also disappointed because they are supposedly a brewery, but they had none of their own beer when we were there! We've been to many brew pubs and this place is a pathetic excuse for one! Don't waste your time or money.",1 star rating,Sarah L.

When we told him our table is willing to spend a couple hundred more dollars on booze and food to stay and watch the game, he continued to tell us we had to leave and than said to one of our group members that she was very rude. It is so unfortunate that this happened , since our group comes to Solvang regularly and we will never return to Solvang Brew Co. And the woman he called ""rude"" is the GM of a restaurant, with 1 additional manager and 3 restaurant industry servers sitting at the table.

7/11/2011,"Bellevue, WA","The SLO area is notable for wineries, but not so much for its breweries.  Solvang Brewing Co. is a rarity in the area, and pretty much the only bar in Solvang, but it's not much of a brewery.  As a bar, it's actually quite nice.  The ambiance is dark and cozy with very new furnishings.  It's quite a cool respite from the hot central Californian summers inside.  Our hero looked hungrily at the food, as it looked pretty good and well portioned (although he was too busy quenching his thirst to fill his gullet with solid sustenance here).The major fault here is their beer.  There's a few ""big name microbrew"" beers on the list and a fairly extensive wine list, but there was ONLY ONE house brew on tap: Just Peachy.  The name pretty much describes it.  If our hero wanted beer that tasted so strongly of peaches, he would have ordered a cider.Also, the guy in at the bar wearing the Solvang Brewing Company beer mug costume was awesome.  Every bar needs a mascot like that with a costume.PROS:- Historical look on the outside, new on the inside.- Cool locals hangout.CONS:- Doesn't seem like they brew their own beers well.  Trust me and skip the ""Just Peachy"".- Drinks are on the pricey side.",3 star rating,Albert W.

11/12/2012,"Monterey, CA","I also read a lot of bad reviews about this place but my wife and thought we'd go against the grain. When we stepped inside, it took a couple minutes for the hostess to come to greet us. And I think she was actually one of the waitresses. First impression was already negative. But I was determined to press through. We sat near the fire place with a cool view of the huge brewing vats. Our waitress was a sweet but spunky girl that reminded us of a modern Viking chick. She helped me to decide between the ahi burger and the black and blue burger. Chose the later and didn't regret it. Paired well with IPA. The tomato basil bisque was ehhh. Wish I would've chosen sweet potato fries instead. My wife wasn't hungry so she ordered spaghetti marinara from the kids menu and she loved it. Happy wife, happy life so it was a great night.",4 star rating,Jose P.
7/4/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","It pains me to knock a star off such a neat little place. But they almost never have any of their own brews out when I am visiting and I can't get over the fact that they could get fries wrong...We came here to close a great day of beer and wine tastings and wanted just one more pint and a snack of pub fries before we headed to bed. The place wasn't too packed for a Saturday night, which was to our advantage. Our server was a little slow, but it was probably because he was almost at the end of his shift. The beer list was still great (lots of California microbrews represented here), but the fries we ordered 10 minutes before the kitchen closing were just...very bad. Underdone to the point of sheer inedibility. These weren't fried, they were blanched-- and they had a very strange texture and taste. The sweet potato fries that were in the mix were decent, but for $5, I'd like my fries to come out fully cooked and crisp.",3 star rating,Frances C.

We agreed on getting a pitcher of ""The Solvang Session"" and it was a great choice. The beer complimented our meals, my wife had the hot pastrami on french roll and I has the baja burger.  The food was on time, and was delicious.  We would definitely go back if we're visiting Solvang.",5 star rating,Dan T.
2/16/2014,"Ventura, CA","My family and I are very disappointed with the service we got here today. Stopped here for a late lunch today and sat inside. The place was not that crowded so we thought it would not be a problem to get served. 1) We were given a dirty table. Apparently they don't even keep track of which tables are ready for seating and which are not.2) I ordered plain pineapple juice for my 2 year old and after only 15 minutes of waiting for our drinks, our waitress brought us a Pineapple RUM drink!!! WTF!!! You can't even tell the difference between a plain kids drink and an alcoholic drink that is served with an umbrella, and all the works?!3) It took over 40 minutes to get our food!!!! 3 tables around us got their food before we did and we didn't even order anything special. Just an all beef hot dog and a reuben sandwich, and for my daughter chicken pieces with a side of fruit. When the food arrived they brought our daughter's meal piled up with fries when I had specifically ordered a side of fruit! 4)Since I ordered the beef hot dog, it should be expected to bring mustard and ketchup to a table. When I asked for these, they looked at me as if I had asked for an alien condiment and the waitress seemed bothered.  Again, this alone took another 10 minutes. 5) The only thing they seemed fast at bringing was the darn check. This place REALLY needs to get its act together. Its not ok to give bad service just because they expect their majority of customers to be ""one time only customers"" since its a known ""tourist"" place. We were not the only table who received bad service. We overheard a few other customers complaining too. I'm sure never coming here again and will definitely NOT recommend this place to any of our friends or family.!",1 star rating,Kattya O.

11/14/2010,"Goleta, CA","Being an avid craft brew enthusiast and homebrewer, I had very high hopes for this new brewpub in my hometown. They were supposed to be open Spring 10 but that was pushed back to the Summer and then they finally opened in the Fall. They received a lot of buzz for restoring the classic Viking Room cocktail lounge but I feel they fell very short. My first visit was an extreme disappointment. On a Sunday afternoon, a couple of friends and I went for some beers and appetizers. To my surprise, they only had 2 of their house beers on the list, along with a collections of beers that ""shape what our beer menu will aspire to be in the future."" Understanding the challenges of brewing and wanting to get open as soon as possible, I was not too surprised. However, being called Solvang Brewing Company, I was expecting these beers to be their flagship house brews.BEER: The Solvang Blonde (not sure if that is the exact name): To put it in the most simple terms, the beer tasted like a glorified Coors Light. I honestly thought they poured it from the wrong draft but glanced over at the bar and saw that, thankfully, they didn't serve mass produced American lagers. The color was spot on but the body was too thin and it lacked any sort of creativity from the brewer. This style is supposed to be pay tribute to the German style Kölsch but everything about the beer was off. Windmill Wheat: After the Blonde, I thought it couldn't get any worse but SBC proved me wrong. The wheat had a spicy aroma with a low hop profile and cloudy pale color. (cloudy was expected since this style is always unfiltered but the Blonde was cloudy as well...?). The taste of the beer was a disaster. There was absolutely no body, which makes me question if they are actually using malted barely and wheat or just extract syrup. The beer was front loaded with some clove like spices but disappeared far too quickly. The aftertaste was extremely watery and completely ruined the beer. I understand a wheat is supposed to be clean and refreshing but to taste like water is unacceptable.FOOD: After the extreme disappointment with their beer, we were hesitant to order really anything on the widely diverse menu. The appetizers ranged from German style pretzels with fondue to sushi. We ended up ordering the fried zucchini and pretzels with fondue. When the waitress set the zucchini down, I thought some fell off the plate on the way to the table. There was at most 10 thinly sliced chips with a bowl of blue cheese. Considering how inexpensive zucchini and panko breadcrumbs are, I would expect more than half of a zucchini for 7 bucks. The pretzels and fondue were okay but nothing memorable. All in all, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. i have been dragged back 2 more times and the only thing that saves me is the selection of other craft brews on the menu. Go for the other breweries they have on tap and steer clear of their house beer.",1 star rating,Ryan D.

5/29/2011,"Long Beach, CA","This place has a lot of potential, but my experience last night was not very good.  First the positive; the hostess was very friendly and cordial.  However, the rest of the night was not ideal.  First off, no one came to say anything to us for at least 10 minutes.  When the waiter finally showed up, he snuck up on us from behind, didn't introduce himself(at first I thought maybe he was the busboy with water), and asked ""Can I get you some drinks"" in a barely audible voice.  Being as this is a BREWING company, they had 5-6 varieties of beer on the menu.  I saw an Amber Ale I wanted and my girlfriend wanted the Blonde Ale.  We tried to order these beers but were informed that they weren't selling those at this time.  What the what??!!???  How disappointing is that.  They only were producing 2/6 beers on their menu.  Other issues included having to bus the table ourselves (asking the waiter if he would like to clear our appetizer plates as he was strategically trying to set down our dinner plates without having to take away the old plates), having the menus and the bread basket on the table for the entire meal, and the waiter never coming to check on us during the meal.The Tap Room Burger I ordered was pretty good and the Fish and Chips for my girlfriend was a pretty large portion and also was decent tasting.  Bottom line, the food was decent, the atmosphere was nice, but the waiter was awful.  I don't know if he was new but it was some of the worst service I have experienced.  I am a pretty easy-going, patient, understanding restaurant customer.  But the beer I wanted wasn't available, the beer I got was flat, and the waiter was awful.Would I go back to this place?  No.  Would I recommend the place to friends?  No.  It is too bad because this place could be a really nice place.",2 star rating,Ryan K.

But in order for the craft industry to keep growing (ie, take market share from from the mass brewers), small places like this need to produce beer that will convince the mass beer drinkers to embrace non-mass beers!Service was friendly, but did take quite awhile to get our food.Food itself was solid: I ordered the cab burger and my wife ordered the Reuben (the latter was especially tasty and they did a nice spin on it: instead of coleslaw, it was pickled purple cabbage).HUGE portions, so two could easily share.I'm hopeful they will up their game on the beer front.  After all, when ""brewing"" is in your name, that has to get better reviews than your food...",3 star rating,Chad H.

We told our waitress and she told us that the ticket for the sixth person was lost (even though all of our orders were on the same ticket) everyone was completed eating and our sixth person still wasn't served. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. We flagged down another server and he said he would go check on it. He can back later and said it was on the counter to be served (he left it there for someone else to bring it out), what!  We then asked to see the Manager and he came out. We told him what had happened and all he said is I will discount the bill, and just walked away. ( no apology)  the bill came out and there was a 50 percent reduction in the food. We paid the bill and we're getting up when the waitress came out and said the manager made a mistake. She handed us a new bill that was  not discounted. They only took the item off.

It took almost 30 minutes just to find a waiter in a dining room that wasn't even full - and one of our party had to go ask for someone to come to our table.

I love going out and showing support for local brews, but these folks really need to get it together with their beer. For me, Solvang is a pretty cool little niche, and as a history buff love this little place. Granted, there are an exceptional amount of Asian tourists, we were there for the xmas tree lighting ceremony which was fun. Desiring a local brew, we went straight to the heart of what we thought would  provide us with quality craft beer. Simply put, I had the Great Dane Pale Ale, and found it to be really ""off"" in taste. Very watered down and not impressive whatsoever. Perhaps it was just me, so I gave the Midnight Lager a try, and again, way too watered down, and a bit of a funk taste to it.We only had the appetizers, so no reviews of the food.It saddens me to give this lame of a review for a little town I enjoy so much.",1 star rating,David D.

Seriously my dad who eats the scraps off of everyone's plate couldn't even touch barely a portion of his fish tacos. The whole plate turned to soup and we couldn't even taste what he had ordered. My 1542 burger was also unfortunately left basically as it had arrived because i couldn't take down more than 3 bites- all of this after taking a 35 mile bike ride to Ventura county. I mean we were starving and I was ready to eat anything but after 2 bites I left it entirely on my plate. Thank god I filled up on beer. Our server was a young guy who just got promoted and honestly he was very sincere and polite. It's nothing against the workers here but I'd like to talk to management. We sat at the bar and waited to be seated for 25 minutes. Once seated we waited about 35 minutes for our burger and tacos to come out.

2/5/2014,"Carlsbad, CA",We were really surprised to find a brewery amongst this little tourist area but stopped on a road trip to stretch and decided to try it- you never know what you might find! Inside not typical of tap rooms or brewery eateries - more old style pub. Full bar . Husband had IPA and then the double IPA. Good -really good . Not Firestone Walker good or the like but pretty good! I had the amber ale as I prefer reds and it was as close as I could also get . Also decent .We tried the Solvang burger - yummy tho I did have to ask for more of the sauce - not nearly enough sauce which was part of its uniqueness. Hubby had Reuben with red cabbage and it was superb- best Reuben either of us had had. French onion soup was yummy . Overall good lunch experience .,3 star rating,Rickey J.

4/12/2011,"San Diego, CA","Caveat: have never been here before, and this rating is solely for a random, crazy evening where we crashed a wedding reception....all the cabbie's fault...So we were all done at dinner, taking the cab back into Solvang to the hotel, and asked our cab driver if there was a good place to grab a beer (beer to end a day/night of wine; good idea, right?).  Since it had been Mr. Toad's Wild Ride x2 up until then, we figured he had a good since of adventure.So he drops us off at this little, unassuming little place, and here we walk into a room full of drunk bridesmaids, groomsmen, guests and bride; with the bartender (or other guest?) walking down the bar pouring shots down a row of throats - jackpot!Haha - without further ado; this place was a blast.",4 star rating,Maureen C.
9/15/2013,"Petaluma, CA","Visited Solvang Brew Co for lunch with my GF, slow service, place was not the cleanest, food was blah.   We started off with the soft pretzels the cheese fondue was cold and more like a jello, not to mention the pretzels were way over salted. We also decided to split the fish and chips,  the batter was supper thick and to greasy.  Not to mention the fly problem.  I'm not the one to leave reviews but this place needs some improvements, so I felt obligated to leave some feed back.",1 star rating,Aaron R.

No one did, so we eventually flagged someone down and asked for menus.The beer flights were good. Entirely passable beer - Not the best; not the worst.

6/2/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","I've eaten here twice now since it's practically the only joint in town open past 7pm, and I'm not usually one for the early bird special.  The first time we came we sat in the bar which was much more bumpin' than the restaurant side of things.  Even though it wasn't very busy our waiter, who had welcomed us to sit wherever we like when we walked in, took about 15 minutes to bring us menus and then another 10 or 15 to take our order.  That's alright, we weren't in a hurry (and thankfully not starving).  I ordered a burger with their black bean patty which was soooooo amazing!  And huge.  And their sweet potato fries are delicious.  And I was so, so full by the end of that meal.  My bf reported that his ahi tuna burger was a tad on the undone side, but everyone else seemed happy with their selections.On our more recent visit we opted to sit in the restaurant since we didn't want the distraction of the TVs in the bar.  The restaurant was freezing.  Someone kept leaving the door open, and it seemed impossible to escape the draft (though we played a brilliant round of musical chairs trying).  We kept our coats on for the meal and attempted to heat ourselves instead from the inside by way of introducing wine to our bellies.  Our waitress was attentive but lacked spirit or sincerity.  Like when she came by to ask us how our meal was and before either of us could even respond she said, ""Awesome,"" and turned away.  This time I had the beet salad which was perfect, and my bf got the burger I had last time.  He requested the black been patty and wasn't quite sure how to respond when asked how he'd like that done.  Uh... thoroughly and evenly heated?  It's not actually meat.  Anyway, they didn't have it available after all, so he had to go with the Boca patty.  Meh, the burger was still good but comparatively bland.  Overall we've found the food to be quite enjoyable but most definitely overpriced.  Given the limitations on late night dinner options in Solvang, I will probably return to the Brewing Company for dinner on subsequent visits, and I will probably mostly enjoy it despite my few gripes.",3 star rating,Alana K.
12/22/2012,"Everett, WA","This is one of those multifaceted reviews that may drive some of my fellow Yelpers nuts.  First element -- the service.  I would give this 5 stars.  No question.  They were polite, genuinely friendly, and quite attentive, despite the place being absolutely hopping with activity.Second element -- the food.  I would give this 4 stars.  We'd had a solid lunch earlier in the day.  We wanted a lighter dinner, so we popped in here around 6 or so and ordered a few appetizers.  We ordered buffalo wings and the Frikadeller slider trio.  The wings were good.  They were big and meaty and cooked well.  The sauce had a good amount of heat.  Just backed off of the amount that would make them unpleasant.  The blue cheese sauce it came with though was kind of watery and didn't cling well to the wings.  The carrots seemed like they may have been blanched, which was just okay I guess.  The sliders were excellent.  Each was distinctly different and had great flavors.  This and some french fries would make an excellent meal if you wanted the variety.Third element -- the beer.  Unfortunately, 0 isn't an option on Yelp, so I guess I have to go with a 1.  I had read the prior reviews that were critical of the beer, but I am an avid homebrewer and I wanted to judge for myself.  So I came in with limited expectations.  They could not even match that.  I have no idea how they can call it a brewing company.  I really don't like giving negative reviews.  But with all candor, this was the worst beer I'd ever had in my entire life.  And I'm including Bud in that, which I think is a swill that doesn't deserve the time honored moniker of being called beer.  I had hoped to try a few sample glasses.  I started with the ""Windmill Wheat Ale.""  The website calls it a Belgian Wit, which is not the description I recall seeing when I read the menu, but it doesn't matter.  It wasn't either one.  What I got was a watered down, thin liquid that had no flavor or character whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  For a wit, you should pick up flavors of orange and coriander.  None of that.  With a standard wheat beer you should either pick up hinted flavors of bubblegum, clove, or banana.  None of that either.  No ""mouthfeel"" either.  A good wheat beer should have a smoothness and I detected none of that.  A good ale should also have some subtle textural component too.  There is no way in the world it had the alcohol content it professed to have either.  After that one, I didn't have the heart to try anything else.  A wheat beer is not a terribly difficult style to create.  If you can't do that one right, I didn't have the inclination to explore anything else.  Thus, if you go, it will be pleasant enough so long as you weren't planning on good beer.  That kind of sucks because for those of us that like craft beer, I had high hopes for a place that it otherwise kind of wine-centric.",3 star rating,Brian B.

10/4/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is my first ever review on Yelp, I feel like I had to say something because the bartender/service was ridiculous and horribly rude, I've never experienced anything like it. I want to start by saying that if you are looking for a fun brewery atmosphere to have a couple of beers, DO NOT come here! There are countless other, MUCH better breweries that deserve a beer lovers patronage.My boyfriend and I had a couple from out of town visiting, and wanted to show them what Santa Barbara wine country was all about. We came here for a few beers to end the night on a Sunday around 9 pm. Prior to coming here, we had been wine tasting earlier in the day, probably to about 4-5 different wineries over the course of 5 hours. Not to mention that my boyfriend was sober cab. Most wineries close around 5 or so, and about that time we headed back to Solvang to check into our hotel, change, rest, etc before dinner. Then we headed to an Italian place, ordered a big pasta dinner and a glass of wine each. At that point we were tired and full, but it was still early and wanted to get a few drinks at a bar with some possibly lively night life to wake us up, the Brewing Co was suggested. We are normally big fans of breweries so were excited to check it out.We got there, keep in mind, it's still early, before 9PM. There were a few diner's still eating, but we headed to the (small) bar to order a beer. We sat down, there was a lively drunk couple next to us that my friend struck up a conversation with. Things were looking up, we were starting getting some energy back, my boyfriend who was sober cab all day was excited to finally be able to drink since we walked here. The bartender asked us if we were doing well, if we had a good day. We said yes, we are visiting the area and had been wine tasting today. She rudely replied with ""That's what I thought, well I'm not going to serve you any drinks, but I'll give you some water or coffee and a menu."" WHAT???Absurd, we were so taken aback and confused, we thought we misunderstood or she was joking. So we drank our waters and she came around again and my boyfriend asked for a beer again. She bitchly replied ""I can refuse service to anyone, and you and your group look too intoxicated."" At that point she looked squarely at my boyfriend who told her he was sober cab all day and we just finished eating a big meal, and she realized how wrong she was, but couldn't take it back at that point, and she was still incredibly rude to us.So, I understand the need for bartenders to stop serving alcohol to people that are belligerent or dangerously intoxicated, we were neither, not even close.We didn't make a big fuss about it, a place like that is not worth our trouble/money. We just left, but very upset and offended might I add.So we will not be back here, ever, and again, if you are looking for a fun brewery atmosphere to have a couple of beers, DO NOT come here!",1 star rating,Kate S.

11/15/2010,"Santa Maria, CA","I want to love this place. But i don't, yet..The two beers (blonde and wheat) were decently brewed but had some style issues. The blonde was to effervescent with to much hop citrus, i was expecting something a little more malty. Still a good beer and would order again.i sampled the wheat from a friends glass and despite it tasting like a german hef, with subtle hints of clove, the bartender served it (without asking) with a chunk of orange already dumped into it. If you want to serve orange with your wheat beer fine, but consult the patron before doing so... What was good was the burger. It was well cooked and had a good flavor, the fondue on the burger was interesting but a nice (but messy) touch. The service was good, and the other beers they had on tap were unique and very good. I had Port Brewings anniversary ale which once again proved to me that beer changes when on tap. They also were pouring Rogues hazelnut brown and had a good selection of local wines. Definitely will be back, can't wait to try future brews both in house and commercial stuff.",4 star rating,Matt D.

He will quote one drink price and ring in a lesser value or just open the cash register to give change and not ring in orders.,4 star rating,Vanessa B.
2/7/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","So I stop in here whenever I am in town, working a gig at Chumash, it is almost always a Thursday night when I am there, I stop by on my way back to my motel in Buellton. I really enjoy their beer selection, all brewed in house, I have tried several, and liked them all. The late night food menu is pretty varied actually, I enjoy the fried Zucchini, but the sliders look pretty damn good, maybe next time. The karaoke, of which I am admittedly too judgmental on, is a bit of a joke. I am a long time karaoke host in Los Angeles, so I know what I am talking about. The karaoke comes from a jukebox type thing, and is controlled by remote control, by hosts, who, as far as I can tell, are paying hardly any attention to the singers, and sing their own songs far too often, and just decide it's cool to join in on other people songs at their whim. It's very sloppy, and comes off as just background noise, and not an actual performance by the singers. The crowd doesn't really pay attention to singers either. Overall, the place is cool, and seems like the only place with any action at all on Thursday nights in Solvang, so I will continue my routine of stopping by after my gigs.",3 star rating,Jeremy C.

1/29/2015,"San Diego, CA","This place hates military, vets and dogs!  Just walk by!   A local customer threatened us in KILLING our dog just because he is a small dog (15 pound dachshund).  My wife and I were in their front beer garden and the local belligerent went away.  Upon placing an order for a round at their inside bar the belligerent reengaged (compete with spit from his expressiveness) and was directly asked to apologize or step away.  As a result our first round of just paid for drinks (plus handsome tip) were taken immediately away by their bartender and WE were asked to leave by the responding bouncers. Avoid this place at ALL cost.  Apparently if you are disabled military you are just suppose to welcome abuse from local belligerents void of establishment protection.   If you don't live here you are an ATM only.  Instead of controlling the very abusive behavior of their local friend (doesn't represent those that live and work hard here in the community) my wife and I were told to leave by the managing representatives and directed to never return. There are plenty of great places in Solvang that look out for the harmony of all family and adult friendly patrons.  This is NOT one of them.  Allow the management to pass into extinction and make way for customer oriented management.  We previously enjoyed taking a few days to relax here from San Diego or other places when still active duty between long deployments in years past.  Right now these two disabled vets would not piss on this business if it were on fire.  The actual owners of this establishment are more then welcome to contact us as we left our information with your representatives.  However we do not expect such professionalism from such an unprofessional change in your establishment.",1 star rating,Mac M.

There was live jazz music which went great with their delicious ""Jule Fest"" beer, we also ordered a half and half of their mouth watering (sweet potatoe/regular) fries! Overall the family had a wonderful time here and we were all satisfied.

We had the Great Dane Pale Ale, Zythos Extra IPA, and Lil Jims IPA (for only about $5 a pint), all delicious. There were plenty more homebrews available on tap and their bottles included delirium, la fin du monde, arrogant bastard, galactic IPA, etc... and obviously subject to change but to sum it up you cannot go wrong with the beer here.The only reason I ended up staying is because of the staff. When I was waiting for my girl to use the bathroom (very accessible and clean) I was just hanging out and got to talking with Michael as well as a few other staff about their beer and other places in town. I was so lucky as to meet the owner (Steve) and his wife (Carrie). All were a blast to hang out with. AND IT'S A FAMILY ENVIRONMENT TOO!The other great thing I enjoyed about this place is sitting outside by the firepit as their wait staff was closing. No one rushed us out and we were allowed to enjoy the fire burning in the comfortable chairs surrounding the firepit.Didn't try their food but I will definitely be back (Hopefully the yelp check-in still applies) Pasta looked good...TL;DR: great beer, friendly staff, cosy fire pit, didn't try food, check this place out",5 star rating,Shai Y.

11/1/2012,"Austin, TX","This brewery was not quite what I expected a brewery to be, however, this is definitely the kind of place for locals.  Maybe not so much for tourists, but it was still a good experience.Unfortunately not everyone who worked the brewery one particular night understood how the kitchen worked regarding when they served food or not.  Therefore it took a little longer than usual to get food.  We fell in the crack where food was not served from 10 to 10:30pm.  Once 10:30 rolled around we ordered a burger and some chicken chimichangas.  The food was actually quite good.  Sadly the same could not be said about their brewery.  I love beer, and maybe I selected the wrong two beers for the night but both the blonde ipa and the dark ale were not to my liking.  Not their fault, but it just made the night a little uneven.  A live band was playing cover songs.  Nothing fantastic, but my gf and I noticed we were the youngest ones at the brewery at that point.  Lots of older folks.  So we skipped the dancing and continued eating our food.The highlight of the brewery was the food.  The rest, not so much.  Again, this was just our personal experience, but I recommend that all the staff be on the same page when it comes to the kitchen.  Other than that, decent service, good food portions, and some nice classic covers to get the energy going.",3 star rating,John N.

The one exception was the hostess, who went out of her way for us. We went for my dad's birthday and she made sure we got a dessert for him on the house. Everyone else seemed to be very busy, bustling about but not getting much done.

12/5/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","This was recommended by the hotel I stayed in and I walked there through the beautiful and quant Solvang. The service was great and there was no wait. I was pleasantly surprised at the live band in the bar. The food was first cabin and served quickly. The servers were attentive and kept my Diet Pepsi topped up. The place has a rustic Santa Ynez or brewery feel which is relaxing. The food however, is not rustic and there were several lavers of flavor which indicates attention to detail. The price was middle of the road but probably inexpensive given the tourist location. The people were very friendly which I have always found to be the case in the Santa Ynez Valley. It is located in downtown Solvang on the main drag through town to Buellton. It is next to the local hardware store which is and optical illusion in size and presents quite a shopping adventure after eating at the brewery. I don't drink, so I'm sorry that I cannot comment on the beer or wines other than to say they have a selection and being in the valley, good ones. Have fun!",5 star rating,Bill J.

We were greeted fairly quick and got seated on the patio at about 5pm. It was a nice, warm afternoon for being outside, but once we got our water and first appetizers, we were constantly batting away flies AND bees. It was very stressful for my six year old. My husband sampled the stout, the amber, and the brown ale--none of which were anything to write home about. Our server told us our second appetizer ticket got lost. It took quite a while for it to come out, but not nearly as long as it took for our entrees to come out. It was ridiculous! The food was mediocre at best.

Took a long time to get another order and even longer to get our check. But overall we were on vacation and not in too much of a rush, so we didn't mind. Sit at the bar for faster, better service.

It's solidly built, full of brick and hard, dark woods. Plenty of TVs if you need them with the volume off to induce a jovial, Irish pub type atmosphere. The seasonal IPA was superb. I also had the extra IPA. All the draft beer is brewed on site. The carnitas nachos (minus carnitas cause I don't eat the meat) were great and plenty to share. The fries were the best I've had in a while and I'm a big fry guy. A random server who wasn't even our waiter came by to ask if we needed anything. We asked for Ketchup and he suggested the made in house BbQ sauce. Great suggestion. It was excellent. My wife's beet, walnut goat cheese salad was fresh and crisp with some great taste.

The kid's burger is big enough to satisfy an adult, so if your child doesn't finish it, you can. Big, juicy chicken tenders for the kids, too.While you're here, and if it's available, you must try the Helhiem (this is how Solvang Brew spells it) Black Rye IPA. It's full of roasted malt flavor, with enough hops to remind you that's it's an IPA. The Zythos Extra IPA is almost like effervescent, dry pineapple juice. Very refreshing. Odin's Stout is robust enough to make you forget you're actually enjoying an oatmeal stout.Everyone, from the busboys to the waitresses, are so attentive & helpful.

Was told by the hostess to seat ourselves in the bar because the dining room was closed, which we did. She also said we could order food, which was what we were after. After sitting at a prominent table and being passed by several servers, I went to the bar to order and was told no, the kitchen was closed. In the meantime plenty of plates were coming out and they actually looked pretty good. So I settled for two beers, the extra ipa and another that I can't remember. The beers were on par with what you would expect from a microbrewery. Finished them and left. The whole time the place was nearly full, so I can't understand why the ownership wouldn't want to capitalize on that- everybody knows people who are eating drink more.

It was extremely cold, but we weren't too worried because the patio was surrounded by heaters. However, after asking two separate people to turn them on we were notified they were not working. We waited an extremely long time for our food. My cousin and husband were having beers but I don't drink beer.

We were told the patio was closed. When another couple came in we were allowed to seat in a very tight area adjacent to the large patio, on a table for two ( 3 in our group). We ordered the half chicken, a pastrami sandwich and an onion soup.when the chicken came out, it looked as it had been prepared for quite a while and it was dry and tasteless. The potatoes that came with it tasted the same as the chicken except for the texture. The pastrami sandwich had the most fat I have ever seen in a pastrami. When we complained about the meat the waiter told us that's how they make it taste good. Well it didn't help, the sandwich was tasteless too. We couldn't eat it. It truly was an artery blocker. The service was OK. For the prices charged (17 for the chicken and 13 for the pastrami the expectation was higher. They seem to depend on tourists coming in one time and never again.

Another review said it right, tastes like they mixed Coors with soda water. Just awful. My lady had another of their beers(don't recall the name) but it was equally as awful. Then comes the food. Bland. Overall not a great experience. For a place to call itself a brewery I'd expect a decent beer. If that's what you want, go somewhere else.",1 star rating,Arlo M.

7/10/2014,"Solvang, CA","Food and drink were good - but the owner or manager needs to know that just because there is only one person (me) left in the room (the middle room) - that multiple members of the waitstaff shouldn't be congregating there to berate customers, swear repeatedly and loudly (and I can potty mouth with the best of them) and socialize excessively.  Completely unacceptable.  My waitress was fantastic but the others were totally unprofessional.  That type of talk is for the after-party folks!",2 star rating,MB W.

My husband ordered the beer sampler size and tried 3 of their beers. I ordered the Dansk amber. All were really good, just depends on what you like. When our waitress brought our wings, she said they gave us 8 instead of 6 since they were small. That was nice & wings were delicious!My daughter ordered the Tap burger with fries, I ordered the Ahi burger with sweet potato fries & my husband ordered the half roasted chicken. All our meals were so good!! Casual pub dining. They have 3 areas you can sit in: dining area, area with tall tables (where we chose) and the bar area. Staff was friendly & service was exceptional.

7/14/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Watched the World Cup game at the bar, the staff was super hard working and friendly but the bartender was possibly the most unfriendly asshole I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. He was rude to his staff and so mean to the customers. I get that you are busy but show some respect and human decency. if a customer ordered a drink that required any prep he would say ""are you really going to make me prepare it when I have a full bar"" in the harshest tone, it was horrible to watch and unnecessary. If you don't like your job then quit but don't make the world miserable were in your bar buying over priced drinks to have a good time. I don't want to listen to you scoff and complain while I drink a beer. His poor staff had to listen to him bitch about everything and scowl at the world. Its not a big deal if your staff uses your orange juice up front or asks you a simple question. Be a decent person or stay at home. You work at a bar in the most happy go lucky place too how much do you really have to complain about?

4/7/2015,"Denver, CO","The food was good, but the service was SLOW. We went on a Monday evening in April at 5pm. We were seated promptly and our server took drink orders soon after we sat down, but that's when promptness ended. After placing our food orders (a bowl of kids pasta, a bowl of French onion soup, a soft pretzel and a sampler platter of sausages), it took an HOUR for our meal to be served. After about 30 minutes, I asked the server to please bring the kids' side dishes out (a small bowl of fruit) which he did, but offered no explanation as to the rest of our meal. I hope that they simply had an understaffed kitchen and a higher than expected turn out that night.  I'm giving 3 stars b/c the food was fine (but not worth an hour wait), my husband liked his beer and the ambience was cool.",3 star rating,Beth B.

We're very in to beer, and were looking forward to this place being an anchor where we could sit and rest a bit. My husband was skeptical about how good the beers would be, but we ended up being very impressed. We ordered tastes of the 2 IPAs and the Stout on the regular menu, plus an extra IPA they were serving that day. All of them were delicious! We also had the pretzel appetizer--loved the cheese/ale sauce and the sweet, seedy mustard. And the fried zucchini--maybe the best I've ever had.

I ordered the Viking Dog with onion rings.... Got plain bun and dog none of the condiments stated on menu... By the time they got to me dog was cold....

He finally offered us more water and then never came back to fill our glasses, another waitress came over and did.The only thing I could hope was that the table buser called off for work and our waiter had never cleared plates in his life.

1/7/2016,"San Buenaventura, CA","We've been to Solvang Brewing Company many times and make a point to stop in the 2-3 times a year we make it up to Solvang. We had the worst experience when we went in this last time. The bartender was rude and completely unfriendly. He was a bald man, I think his name was Chuck, and seemed to have a serious attitude problem. As a member of the service/bar industry, I'm shocked that he still has a job there. He was pushy and abrupt with me and my husband but seemed to do a complete 180 being friendly and courteous to the group of obviously drunk individuals sitting right next to us, all of whom should not have been served anymore alcohol, in my opinion. The food was your typical bar food but was subpar at best. After spending about $70 for a mediocre dining experience, we ended up taking most of it to go due to being so uncomfortable and feeling so unwelcome, much to the chagrin of Chuck, who essentially threw our to go items at us and ignored me when I politely asked for plastic ware. If the management knows anything about the service industry, they will address this bartender's poor service immediately.",1 star rating,Jessica L.
1/1/2011,"Solvang, CA","I've been here about eight times since it opened, so consider myself a somewhat frequent customer.When they started out, we the expected ""shake down cruise.""After a few months, I can honestly say the food is very good, the non-Solvang Brewing Company brews pretty good, but sadly, the service falls way short.A few weeks ago we went in to dine & sample brews in the Viking Room and weren't even acknowledged after 13 minutes. After I had even roamed around to ""flag"" a server over, we still wait another 10 min. We walked out!Another time we waited 5 to 8 min. to get brews, even while seated at the bar, and even longer to order & eventually receive our meals. Not goodI have heard this same complaint from numerous people who live in the Santa Ynez Valley over & over. lately.  Many have said, ""We're done and will go to Root 246, back to Firestone, or the new (Buellton) Figueroa Mountain Brewery.Yes, it takes time to get it together in the restaurant business, but the service end needs to ""dialed in"" quickly if you wish the locals to support you.Will we return?

9/25/2014,"Solvang, CA","This is a great place to have a beer but that's it.  Every time we come here, we sit outside and are given our menus, but nothing for another 30 mins and then we order, they drop off our food and that's it. The nachos used to be my favorite but they got worse and worse each time I went. Last time they were so greasy we filled the plate/bowl underneath entirely with grease. We didn't eat any of it and told our waiter and showed him all of the grease. He took 10% off of the price of the nachos. Seriously? I can see if we ate some of it or if we had changed our minds, but we did not touch it, told them right away, sat looking at a bowl of grease for another 20 mins and still had to shell out full price minus a few cents. I'm a local and I try to help out our businesses as much as possible, but I was upset by this whole thing, especially because we don't have money to waste and this was special for us. Or I could be hormonal, but hey, what's done is done. And to be fair, the slow service is his fault, but the nachos or how the situation was handled was not. That is the kitchen and manager's fault, the waiter was trying to be nice about it and I give him props.Another time we went, our waitress gave us our change back, but was $5 short. When I asked her about it she rolled her eyes, actually grunted and took the money out of her pocket and slammed it on the table and took off. There are some servers here that are wonderful and sweet and it's a good place to drink beer and hang out with some friends.

We sat next to the fireplace (gas operated) for the warmth - it was cold in the restaurant. Not a good choice because it was next to the entrance to the game room and there were constant kids/adults going in-out of this very noisy room. Hubby had the brown ale which he really liked, I tasted it and agreed it was good. He ordered the pastrami sandwich with French fries. It was a hefty sandwich with plenty homemade fries. The only thing he didn't care was the cheese sauce melted on top of the sandwich. Normally he just has the traditional pastrami sandwich. I had the chioppini (?) claiming to be their award winning dish for $23.95. It looked good, it had shrimp, clams, mussels, really tiny baby scallops (wasn't sure what it was at first) & cubed fish in a tomato broth sauce over fettuccine noodles. The quantity was great, the only con is that I didn't care for the fish cubes, which they put a lot in the dish - it didn't taste fresh. May explain I had the runs the next day. Should have tried the Danish meatballs instead since they had great reviews.",3 star rating,Rosalinda Y.

The food was still delicious, loved the hamburger and the salad. (I got the Greek). I knocked them down a star this time for a few reasons:1. Their beer. They had 8-9 of their own beers on tap. My husband and I tried 4 of them, and of those 3 were not good at all. The blonde was undrinkable. My husband liked the Black IPA OK, but I thought everything tasted flat. 2. The service. We were there on a Sunday evening, and the dining room was only about half full, but everyone seemed flustered and overwhelmed. We had to ask for things multiple times, and tables around us had to wait a long time to order. It was nothing big, but it made me wonder how well they handle a busy Saturday night. In all, I still loved the burger, and that was enough to bring me back. I hope they will improve the beers, or bring in some other local beers along with their own.",4 star rating,Katie G.

I can understand how the food and service could be under par during busy times, so perhaps try coming here between lunch and dinner.

The portions were HUGE. Needless to say we left with full bellies and happy hearts. During night two of our stay, we decided to go back...it was that good.  We were served by Melissa at the bar and she was so great!

Our waitress, Taylor, came over and told us she was getting water and menus about 4 times before we saw either. I understand it was a Sunday afternoon and fairly busy but not packed. It took half hour to get our drinks and another 45 to actually receive some of our food. Three of our plates came out together, one came 10 minutes later and one our waitress didn't put in at all. We had completely finished our food by the time our lase plate came out, which by the way was a salad. Typically a place with good business practices would either discount or comp that plate, they did neither. The food was pretty bad, the meat in both our Ruben and pastrami sandwiches were thick, fatty and hard to chew. The last kicker was when we paid, we did not receive any change. Our waitress just kept it, as I tip I assume. It was only 2 or 3 dollars and we were pretty eager to leave so we weren't going to stay and fight it.  Out of 5 of us, we wont be eating here again and i know i personally will warn people to steer clear of this place.",1 star rating,Sarah G.

8/17/2015,"Brooklyn, NY","Where do I start.  Not a food snob but this place definitely goes down as one of the worst places that I have ever eaten. I repeat EVER!  Bad sign from the beginning. Yes I know it's a brewery, but the bartender couldn't even give a recommendation for wine. Hello, isn't Solvang a major area for wine?  It was over 30 minutes to get a table.  I'm patient, way did it take another 20 minutes for our server to appear. Actually the server did his best. He was very polite.  The restaurant was short on servers AND the servers had to clear the tables! Really? But he really did his best. I only wished that he would have warned us not to order food. The fish tacos were inedible.  There were only tiny over cooked chunks of tuna covered in some type of cream sauce.  Old wilted lettuce tried to cover up the flavorless mess on the plate.  The burger was equally unappealing.  Only the bread was touched.  The only good thing were the pretzels. Glad I ordered those.  I hate giving bad reviews, but if this place wasn't in a tourist town, it would be shut down. Gordon Ramsey do you hear me?",1 star rating,Janise M.

7/28/2012,"Coto De Caza, CA","Went here today around 6 for dinner right before the 8 pm crowd. I was just me and my friend. We got seated right away ,we chose to sit outside. Patio area was peaceful. We got served drinks promptly. Waitress was nice enough to put our order in before her party of 15 so we got our food on time. I ordered the bans burger and my friend had the pastrami. We split it so I can officially say both meals were cooked perfect. Juicy, and delicious. Their sweet potato fries are top notch. There was a live band starting around 8 which we missed. But the crowd was definitly getting bigger. As for my experience the service was 5 stars up to the point where we needed our check. Our drinks got refilled due to a very diligent guy who wasn't the waitress. I think he is a step below that cleans the tables. They need to step him up!! He came over to our table and made sure we were cared for. Fortunately I didn't ask my waitress for advice on the beer. Turned out she didn't drink beer. Lol. I got a sample of five beers. I recommend the honey blonde ,& stout for those who like darker beers. Do not order the rasberry it is disgusting!!! Bad aftertaste and something is off with the carbonation!! Overall I gave four stars due to the food being so yummy. We waited for our check is say 15 min til we decided to go to the front ourselves to pay. Hence minus a star. Worth trying there burgers!",4 star rating,Omni W.

The sweet potato fries are good too.  The beet salad is also good if you want something light.  The service has improved each time which is good because it was bad the first time. Hopefully after a couple of months they'll have it together.  The biggest problem I have with them is the beer. It has been TERRIBLE.  I've had 4 different kinds and they've all been bad.

Our 10 year old had the grilled pastrami and cheese sandwich and my husband and I had the danish meatballs with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. Excellent food! The only downside was our server.

5/18/2014,"Campbell, CA","Was in Solvang last week and pretty much was disappointed with the town, this Brewery was part of that poor experience.   Was at the Solvang Brewing Co twice, the first time in the afternoon (Thursday), the second time on Friday night.  During the afternoon visit, the restauraunt was largely empty, the service was mediocre, the food was okay but the beer was the highlight, with high prices. The music was from a juke box, (a dollar a song) and when no one is playing music there is a crappy radio station on.  Not much of an atmosphere.  On Friday night, it was crowded, (little else is open in this town after 6PM which is why we went back), the service staff overwhelmed, we asked the waitress how long the wait would be, she said, ""I don't know"" and walked away.  When we left, there were several employees talking and smoking on the side of the place.   I sense this place survives because the town shuts down early and they have a captive audience of tourists.  We ended up at the Irish bar down the street, Fitzpatrick's, which I would recommend others visit as well.",2 star rating,David S.
2/19/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","WORST BEER I've ever had!!! I'm not gonna come out say I know everything about beer, but I definitely drink it a lot and have tasted micro brews up and down the California coast and throughout the mid-west. Whenever we travel, my girlfriend and I try and check out the local breweries, so after a great day of wine tasting and walking around downtown, we thought a trip to The Solvang Brewing Company was the perfect way to end our night. The place was busy and the staff was very upfront about this fact as soon as we got there, which we appreciated. We were in no rush and decided to wait it out and not really care how long it took to be seated or even for our food to come out. Then came the beer...We had 3 beers total. The Stout was serviceable, and to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of stouts to begin with, so I am gonna let this one go. I then had the Amber. I couldn't even finish it. Several people have mentioned the amount of carbonation in their review and they weren't exaggerating. What they forgot to mention, was the horrible taste. There was not even a hint of malt, and the ""floral"" hops were overpowering and completely out of place. Then there was the mystery  flavor that was somewhere between soap and bad olives. I have never sent a beer back in my life, but I wouldn't have played beer pong with this beer. Finally, there was the Blonde. This one tasted like someone behind the bar was mixing Coors light and club soda. I forced myself to finish this one as I ate, but I would definitely not use the word ""refreshing"" to describe this atrocity.But here is the best part of the evening. As we were finishing, the owner approached the table to ask how our evening went. I politely said everything was ""just fine"" in an attempt to leave and be done with the place. He began to walk away but turned around and engaged us once again, claiming that ""just fine"" wasn't allowed in his restaurant and asked what he could do to make it better. I began to express that the beer wasn't to my liking and, after defending his brews and pointing out some guy in a black shirt at the bar who was supposedly a beer critic for Beer Advocate Magazine was currently ""loving"" the selection, he offered to buy me a few beers to try and change my mind. I felt this was a very kind gesture and agreed to try a few more beers. After about 5 minutes, our server came, cleared our plates and brought us the check. I paid, signed for everything, and continued to wait for the beers that were going to wow me. After a little while longer I began to wonder if anyone was coming back. I looked at the time stamp to see when my card was swiped and noticed it had been over 15 minutes ago. I then gave the owner 5 minutes to make good on his promise, giving him a grand total of somewhere over 20 minutes to bring me his view changing brews. Those last 5 minutes came and went, and my girlfriend and I simply got up and left without ever seeing the owner again. I can deal with bad, food and even bad beer, but this last act was completely insulting. I'm sure the owner was just too busy ""convinceing"" all the other customers they simply hadn't tried enough of his wonderful concoction.  This is the first review I have ever written on any review site. But as a lover of micro brews, I felt compelled to prevent any other beer enthusiasts from ever having to endure even one sip of this breweries ""beer.""",1 star rating,K H.

I don't know when people in Solvang like to eat their appetizers but I prefer it sometime after drinks and well before the main course. And it wasn't like our entrees came out so quickly, they didn't have a chance to serve the appetizer.  We got our burgers 40 minutes after we ordered them.  Okay, you might be thinking, ""Maybe you guys ordered something that took a long time to prepare?"" Nope, we got freakin' onion rings. Onion rings. Does it really take 45 minutes to make onion rings?! If it does, then you're doing it wrong. Learn from Carl's Jr or Jack in the Box or any other fast food joint that can fry up some rings in less than 5 minutes even if they're filled to capacity.

The food was delivered by a wonderful girl who also followed up with bringing us silverware, which the waiter never noticed we didn't have.  The waiter did stop by to ask how everything was and noticed that my napkin had blown off my lap. He told me he would bring me another, but after 10 minutes I had to go get one myself, only to see him having a good time with his friends.

We arrived at about 4:15pm for an early dinner & to relax with a couple beers after a 5 hour drive from San Diego. We received our drinks & food in a reasonable amount of time. Half way through our meal, we both ordered a second beer. The busboy brought them to us. We hadn't finished our meal yet or even a few sips of our drinks when the waitress came to our table and gave us the check. The place was not busy so we were a little confused as to why we were clearly being rushed out. After that, we were approached 2 more times and asked if we were done eating, to which we answered no. Next thing we know, the waitress comes over and asks if we need change. My husband informed her that we hadn't even put money in the folder yet because we weren't finished and might order another round.  She looked obviously annoyed and walked away. At that point we decided to go somewhere else. My husband put a credit card down, she ran it and brought it back. As soon as he signed it, she snatched it away without another word.

The service was extraordinarily slow given that it was only 5.45pm and the place was less than half full. The waiters were not very friendly or welcoming and we were ignored for several minutes before we were seated. In fact, my wife had to flag someone  down and ask if we could be seated and was told to sit at any open table. We found one and were again ignored for 5 mins before we got to place our orders. The beer was not very good especially the brown ale. The pale ale was the only decent one of the lot I tasted. The open face sandwich was a joke for $10, house salad on top of a piece of stale bread and a chunk of bland cheese. The sausages entree was decent but way overpriced for 3 sausages and mashed potatoes. We regretted going there for dinner especially after seeing that the other restaurants nearby had opened in the meantime. I wouldn't recommend eating here or the beer.",2 star rating,s v.

4/17/2013,"Palm Desert, CA","On the evening of Saturday, April 6, 2013, my wife and I were seated at an outside table at the Solvang Brewing Company.  After 45 minutes, we were informed that our food order had been lost.  After re-ordering dinner, we waited an additional 30 minutes for our food to arrive (total wait time = 75 minutes).  Dinner finally arrived, but my wife's steak was served medium instead of medium rear.  I approached the manager who then offered to serve a replacement steak (cooked medium rear) and half off our tab to compensate for food coming out of the kitchen so late.  When we received our bill, no compensation was given.  In addition, the manager stated that there was a large party inside that kept the kitchen overly busy.  My reply was that if you are going to seat us anywhere in the restaurant, it should not matter what other parties are going on inside - therefore, why should I expect to be given 2nd priority over a group gathering taking place inside the restaurant.",1 star rating,Dean C.
4/15/2012,"Chatsworth, CA","There were a few things about this place that made it a must go on our recent vacation... Its the place that stays open late in the quaint sleepy town of Solvang, its a brewery in the midst of wine country, and well the food sounded good when we glanced at the menu. So we ended up here before a long drive home to have some dinner and for the boyfriend to try some beer after our day of wine. This place became quite a surprise for us. Its not like we don't go out often but both agree this is one of the best meals out we have had in a long time, maybe our whole time together... The quality and flavors were awesome and he enjoyed the beers. There was live music on in the lounge that was great too.  We also got to try a brownie stout sundae for dessert. Our waitress Bridget was right on the whole night too and provided great service, even put a lemon in my coke to go. We will definitely go back as many entrees sounded good beyond the stroganoff and danish burger we had. Glad to have found a great place amongst a sleepy town.",4 star rating,Heather N.
12/10/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Granted, we got there later in the evening, BUT, the quality of the food should not be determined by the hour of the visit.  All that said, it was open and we didn't have many options.  We tried to order two appetizers (Pretzels and Sausages), and they were out of both.  We settled on the nachos and sliders.  Sliders were eh.  There was twice as much bun as meat and the meat was mixed with grilled onions and there were also onions ON the meat patty....a bit too much onion for me.  The nachos had WAY too much going on with them.  There were pickled carrots which was bizarre, too many jalapenos, bland pork.  They were definitely 'loaded', but there was a lack of chips to go with the load.  Finally, at a 'brewhouse', wouldn't you expect a sampler option for the beers?  They did not have one but did offer us a smaller 'taste' for $1.50 each.  Fine.  We tried a few and they were ok.  if it's all you have, take it, but they need to improve a bit more before we would return.  The Creme Brulee was not ok.  It was lumpy and the sugar on top was not crispy and hard; it was softer and gooey.  Also, the server dropped a few cuss words for us while she was trying to relate to us.  As we were walking out, a woman I assume to be the manager said good night and thank you, but she was hanging out around the bar and it was unclear as to whether or not she was being polite or really was the manager as she was engaging aggressively with the bar patrons.",2 star rating,Amber P.
11/24/2010,"Denver, CO","I understand that this a new restaurant and they will obviously have a few bugs to get out, but its actually really horrible. Menus are printed on plain paper and stapled together, looks like a child's book report. The staff does not know anything about the menu or how to wait tables. The bussers were actually quite friendly and helpful, but the rest of the wait staff was not good at all. Food did not come how how we ordered it either; i asked for my sauce on the side, it was smothered in it, and asked for grilled onions and got both grilled and regular onions. The salmon was good, but not wonderful. Burger were good also, but not worth coming back for since the atmosphere is so bad.There are not decorations on the walls, everything is brown inside. It has no character at all, just brown tables, walls, and floors. On top of that the beer is not good either, I ordered an IPA and it tasted like a heff. When you drive by you can barely tell its open, as its so dark inside its hard to tell. Really disappointing, because I like how they are open late, and the location is great. Lots and lots of room for improvement.",2 star rating,Ashley M.
11/8/2010,"San Diego, CA","My husband and I stopped here on the way to San Simeon.  We were looking forward to the food here.  The staff was polite and the place looked pretty clean.  However, the burger they offered my husband gave him major indigestion the rest of the day and did not come the way he had requested it.  I ordered the pretzel with fondue sauce and had to send the sauce back because it was cold.  It was completely tasteless when it came back and by that time the pretzels were hard.  I ended up feeding them to our dogs.  Maybe we tried the wrong things but I would not be tempted to return.",2 star rating,Patricia I.
8/23/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","After drinking wine all day, it was a little strange having a beer with dinner. It was a little late and, honestly, there's nothing to do in Solvang past sundown, so this place was a nice little haven. Not expecting much, I was really surprised how good the food was. We had nachos as an appetizer, but they really could have been the entire meal. Massive plate. I had one of their burgers too which was pretty good. Afterwards we hung out in the bar for a drink or two before we left. Much better then staying in the hotel and ordering cheap delivery pizza.",4 star rating,Matt F.
2/11/2014,"Los Osos, CA",First time to Solvang. SBC was the the second menu we looked at as we walked down the street in search of food. Glad we circled back around. Both the Full Nelson and Valhalla IPAs were great. We started with the Ale House Sausage Sampler. The Danish medisterpolse and beer poached bratwurst were great with the spicy mustard. The chef's choice sausage was a Louisiana hot link. The spicy sausage went great with the whole seed mustard that was kind of sweet. It also comes with fondue a soft pretzel which was kind of like a breadstick. Both were delicious. (Save the leftover fondue for the fries.) We split a fish and chips for the main entree. The tartar sauce wasn't the best I've had but the were two big chunks of flaky fish were cooked perfectly--light and not greasy. Bridget was our server. She answered all of our questions about the menu and her service was great. We're definitely going back on our next visit to Solvang.,5 star rating,Nolan P.

6/28/2012,"Maricopa, AZ","Stopped by Solvang Brewing on 6/27/2012 two weeks into a long road trip. it was amazing. Not sure Yelp is a great guide for best restaurants when i have been going to top yelp rated places and some were poor (great ones too), then i pick a random one like Solvang Brewing that i later found out only had a 3 start on yelp, and it was the best place on the trip. First of all, three staff were very attentive, i never had to ask for water re-filled. Second, the food was huge. Nachos Carnitas appetizer blew me away. about a foot high. and very unique nachos....loved it. different salsa's, variety of onions. great. Third, i had the Danish Burger. Fitting to choose that if in Danishland. It was amazing. One of the best burgers i have had, and if you can get a burger like that at Red Robin, someone made an error. Not even close. The bun was thick and soft like from a local bakery. it was fresh, and whatever combination of sauce and toppings was perfect. Last, i got the tomato soup and had some of my girlfriend's french onion soup. Both tremendous. I have gone to many great places in San Fran and Solvang Brewing to me was right up there. Will definitely go back!!",5 star rating,Richard S.
2/17/2012,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","The hotel recommended the Solvang Brewing Co when we arrived in town. We were hungry after the drive from LA so we took him up on it. We sat on the patio on a beautiful day ordered a burger and wanted to try the Micro-brews. The burger was pretty good with a mix of potato and sweet potato fries but the beer was a HUGE mistake ! It tasted like dish water and they didn't have the selection that was on the menu. I actually e-mailed Solvang Brewing to voice my opinion about their ""selection"" and the GM returned an e-mail stating that in December they actually had a ""professional"" beer taster in to sample their beer. The GM said he rated the beer from good to premium. Well I don't know what that guy was smoking but we will never be back there again ! They didn't even have my size of Tee Shirt in stock and the GM didn't even offer to send me one when she invited us back up to the Brewing Company.",1 star rating,Jeff G.
10/27/2010,"Santa Ynez, CA","As locals we have been anticipating the Solvang Brewery opening for several months. My husband and I decided to try the brewery on a Wednesday night.  Since the World Series game was on we opted to sit in the restaurant instead of the crowded bar area. The hostess greeted us promptly and seated us at a table by the window.  Yes the menu is printed on copy paper but we were told their new menus are on the way.  It was our waitresses second day and she informed us she had not tried anything on the menu and could not really recommend anything, We both opted for one of the many burgers.  I had the Tap Room burger cooked medium.  It was delicious and came on a big fluffy bakery bun that was toasted just right.  You have your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, soup or salad. Based on the burger alone I would eat here again, it was huge and delicious!  I do recommend that the owner have his wait staff sample the menu. Also the bread that came before the meal looked like it had been hacked at with a pocket knife. I look forward to trying some other menu items and will post a follow up.",3 star rating,Karen C.
6/28/2011,"San Diego, CA","Only place open that evening that was anywhere near our hotel.  Solvang closes down early, even in the summer.  Hostess very friendly, cheery.  From there the service went downhill.  Not many people eating there at first which made me uneasy, but as other tourists wandered in we realized everyone was coming here by default.  So our waiter must have an aversion to being helpful and prompt.  He was very slow.  We thought the food was just ok.  The amazing thing was how long we waited for our check.  At least two other employees came by and asked if we wanted more water etc, and we stated: just the check please.  Our waiter wouldn't look at us as he was in and out of the room, actually appeared to be avoiding us.  He finally kind of sneaked by and dropped the bill off, not saying a word, came back later to get it, didn't say anything.  Maybe he has personal problems but he was almost anti-social.  My husband wanted to give him a tip, I didn't.  We settled for a tip, not a generous one.  Needless to say, it was an odd evening in a cute touristy town.",2 star rating,Patricia W.

4/30/2021,"Fresno, CA","I really want to rate this place higher, but dayyyum the service was a complete shit show, and the 18% automatic gratuity added to the bill was a kick in the teeth so for those reasons I cannot. To start, the line was LOOOOOONG!!! It was pretty much that way everywhere, so we felt locked in after devoting 30 min of standing in line, once we got to the window and saw their 18% gratuity sign. But, I figured if there was going to be table service then whatever. The girl at the register for the life of her could NOT understand our simple order. I should've taken that as a sign to leave but I was tired, hot and hangry. I tried being patient, but kept having to repeat the order to her. We had wanted to order the Pulled Pork Sandwich. She rang us up for it, but then said 'sorry we are out.' So then we ordered fish n chips as a replacement and asked that we get lemons for the order...she said we would have to go inside and get them. That wouldn't have been a big deal...HAD THEY NOT BEEN IN A BOWL SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER *face palm* What am I paying the gratuity for again??? Our order arrived 45 minutes later, separately I might add, and that was the end of the services. No waiter was seen or heard from again, and that's why their gratuity is bogus. I had to pay $15 tip for y'all to do nothing more than walk my food out to me??? For me to have to go in and get my own lemons when they were sitting right next to the cashier??? What a ripoff. The food however was good, and for that they deserve more stars...a solid 4 stars. The people in my group that ordered burgers remarked that theirs were really good, and the toppings were fresh. I had the pastrami sandwich and it was really good. I liked that they added was peppers, although I would've been fine w/ just pickles. I didn't order the fish, but I had a chance to sample it and it was very yummy. No hint of fishiness, the batter was crisp and the fish itself was flaky. I'm not usually a fan of tartar sauce but they add garlic or some special ingredient that gave it some extra oomph. I used the extra sauce to dip my fries in and used every last drop. The food was good, but I don't know if it's worth the hassle and auto gratuity to return again.",2 star rating,VeeVee N.

The bartender was nice when we said hello to her and she took our order but she definitely seemed over it and took her mask off to talk to us and other customersAlso the customers behind us were not social distancing but there are no floor signs so we had to keep moving away.

Another friend got the fish tacos and she said they were so fishy tasting that we had to send them back. They were also supposed to come with guacamole, but they didn't so we had to ask for it.

It was in the fall, and they had their Pumpkin Craft (don't remember the name lol) and it is AMAZING if you love pumpkin. It's like liquid pumpkin pie. Took a growler home. Waitresses on all occasions have been really, really nice and quick.  We visited again on St. Patty's Day (during the day, like 1PM) and had a BLAST. We're older (lol) and can't remember much of the visit, except we had their Irish Nachos (which I assume are holiday only) and they were GREAT. My friend ordered the fried zucchini, and it was awesome as well. My husband topped it off by ordering the something tempura roll and it was REALLY good. I drank the Raspberry Wheat, and it was delicious. A bit thicker than Shock Tops Raspberry, but much more of a raspberry flavor to it, which suited me. Bythe time we left, all four of us were feeling *very* nice (lol). We returned around 9PM, and it seemed to be more of the college scene. So definitely a spot if you are looking for 'entertainment' in the area, but it's a bit young (not hatin'- I was young once myself). Solvang comes off as an ""older' village.. Would've loved to stay, but old age hit us and we were in bed by 10PM.

Our server really did not seem to care that we never received our dessert ""I know it went out, I guess it just did not get to you."" Thanks Captain Obvious. I love, love, love IPA and I was not impressed by theirs in the least and at 23 bucks I was even less happy.Save your money and stop  by the gas station for some Firestone IPA and have a hotel party!",1 star rating,Rebecca T.

7/22/2014,"Denver, CO","The staff is friendly and we were seated right away, got our beers pretty fast and placed a food order within minutes.  However, this is where it all started to fall apart.  We ordered a salad and some sliders to split as we weren't that hungry.  So how long do you think it takes to get a salad and an appetizer?  Try 40 minutes.  When we asked about our food status about 25 minutes into our wait, they said that unfortunately a 16-person party's order was put in right before ours, so ours was taking unusually long. What kind of a kitchen pushes a small order of salad + apps for 2, behind a huge party's order?  This soured our experience on this place significantly... then it took a bit to get our waitress' attention to get the check and get out of there. We left 30 minutes later than we expected to, and ended up missing our friends for cocktails afterwards.  The food was just OK.  The beet salad was really good, but the sliders? One was pulled pork and it was COLD. The two others were too well-cooked.  I know they're sliders and it's hard to judge done-ness for those small patties, but hello? Just cook them for less time.  I wish we said something about the delay; we should have had some beers comped or something for the inconvenience. Saw no manager on duty to complain, or one that even acknowledged our issue. I won't return here.",2 star rating,Erica F.

7/20/2017,"Moreno Valley, CA","Out of a 10 day road trip all over California, Solvang Brewing Company served the best meal of the whole trip. My family ordered 3 entrees and split them all between us so we could sample them together. All three were fantastic (pork belly tacos, beef stroganoff, and jager schnitzel). I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the pint I ordered was good, and the margaritas were cold and strong. We ended up here mostly because the rest of the town closes up very early, and SBC was open for a late dinner. Around 9pm the place got very busy and they obviously didn't have enough servers available. Service got really slow, which is the only reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. However, the food and drink was worth the wait. Even when he was obviously in the weeds, our server was hustling and smiling the whole time.",4 star rating,Jen G.

7/13/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Beer tastes watery and bland. For a brewing company, I expect a lot better.Service is terrible. I've been here twice now and am not impressed. This last experience was abysmal at best. I couldn't catch the girls name... I believe she is a runner... she moped around with a frown on her face and was so robotic, I couldn't tell whether she was simply unhappy with her job or maintains a super emo personality in general. Needless to say, whatever the reason, it's unacceptable for a business in customer service. Whoever hired this girl clearly missed the mark. The waiter was more animated and more helpful; however, he was absent. It wasn't busy at the time so I don't see why I had to sit there for 10 minutes before finally getting my chance to order a drink while everyone else at the table was almost finished with their first round. Also, there is no option to order chicken nachos. Apparently, Solvang Brewing Company doesn't order enough chicken to have that option...??? That was what I was told anyway, even though the last time I was there we had chicken nachos. I don't quite understand that reasoning, but if it is true, the head chef needs to change that.All in all, I'm glad Santa Barbara has other Brew Co's to choose from.",2 star rating,Stephanie C.

7/17/2012,"West Covina, CA",walked in got seated and immediately bad service started we ordered their main burger a danish dog and a beer.  The servers were not attentive to us they seemed to favor the bigger family groups  and did not deliver on danish dog which did not come with what it said it has.  The burger was good with out a doubt but the danish dog seriously lacked just like the servers. the manager was working harder than all the servers put together.We were not the only unsatisfied customers their another patron was complaining and yelling by the enterance.2 Stars for the good burger and the managers extra effort.,2 star rating,Dahmer S.
10/1/2017,"Solvang, CA","Negative Lunch experience. Half of the restaurants seating is not covered by a server at lunch. It seemed necessary though as almost all table were occupied.

When you do receive your order it is packaged to go, even though you are eating in the restaurant creating a lot of unnecessary trash. The two stars are for the food being alright.",2 star rating,Scott B.

8/6/2014,"Murrieta, CA","We visited this restaurant for dinner. The entire place had three tables occupied. My wife and I started with soup and salad. Both were very good. Then I had beef stroganoff and my wife had peppered seared Ahi. First, half way through our soup / salad they bring our main course . what's wrong with this picture, can't they see that we are still eating! We then started on our main course. First the fish was unpalatable so over salted. We sent it back and the new fish was reasonable. The original fish had been sitting on rice and veggies. When they brought the new fish the sides were unchanged an still VERY salty. Really not good. Now on to the beef stroganoff . The kindest thing I can say is next time I'll buy Stouffer's and micro wave in my hotel room. In a word awful. The service was reasonable the price for what we got was extortionate . Never again.

8/10/2014,"San Francisco, CA",Came by on a sunny Sunday afternoon. It was pretty packed and we sat outside. The service was a bit slow and disorganized (but they were nice and respectful so I will cut them some slack!). I would give the pastrami sandwich a 10 star rating because it's THAT good. No joke- best I have ever had. Super meaty and the bread was amazing melt-in-your mouth yum. Hubby had sample platter if sausage and sister in law had the Ruben which was delish.

8/12/2015,"Hermosa Beach, CA","The menu is broad with a strange variety of options. We had the hummus and tempinade app. It was a good size portion for two people served with warm pita bread, celery and carrots. My sister ordered the beet salad and added ahi to it. I had a burger and a beer. The wait time between the app and meal was long. The food was fresh and tasty. There was a lack of a sense of urgency with the staff, so make sure you have ample time when you go to visit. It was a bit overpriced for the type of food it was, but overall a nice experience.",4 star rating,Melissa A.

Mm, it was ok.The appetizers were really good.  We tried some zucchini...that was really good.  My gf really liked the beer battered onion rings.  I thought they were ok.They also have live music in the bar area, which is actually pretty good sized.  We had some chicken wings there later on in the night, and they were pretty good.",4 star rating,Kim G.

3/12/2012,"Lake Forest, CA","As a microbrewery fanatic, I was happy to see that there was a brewery in Solvang.  The bar area had a ""dive bar"" feel, not atypical of Solvang.  My wife ordered her usual Hefeweizen while I went with the IPA.  The Hef, made in a German style, was undrinkable.  The IPA, stated to be at 9.2% abv, was watery and light in flavor with no hop character.  The bartender brought over samples of the brown ale, a winter ale and a lager style beer.  All were poorly executed.  My wife went with a Vodka/cranberry.  As 5 of the 11 beers (probably too many since they apparently have  issues) were so ""off"" there may have been some contamination in their delivery or brewing systems.Unfortunately, the rating for the beers is a 1.  We did not eat there but did hear from locals that the burgers are very good.",1 star rating,Robert H.
6/26/2016,"Lancaster, CA","The food is the star of this brewery. I had the Brewhouse Pastrami. It was a great sandwich where the bun truly made it great. One thing is obvious, this place is taking advantage of the numerous bakeries in the area and it is smart. Solvang Brewing Company is a little pricey, $12.95 for the sandwich and fries. That being said the portion was ample and you are in a tourist trap, one of my favorite, but a trap all the same. So the price is quite good. If you are in a hurry this is likely not the place for you, unless you lie that you have to be at work by 3 PM. Hey buddy it's 3:20 you are late for work. It took 15 minutes to be seated and 35 minutes to get food. The wait is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.",4 star rating,Chris R.

11/21/2012,"Fresno, CA","I've made it a quest to target every brewery I come across for the last year, ever since my cousin turned me on to new, more interesting beers. In a way it's a lot like wine tasting, lots of variety in the styles and the hosts everywhere you go.Unfortunately, this one was a real let down. All of the beer tastes like it could have come from the supermarket; it was just terribly bland and flavorless compared to every other small brewery I've ever been to. Between the three of us we tried everything on the menu (not hard, only 5 brews available, lots were crossed out, the rest were other breweries'), so I got to taste them all and wasn't impressed by anything, including the seasonal pumpkin ale, which was thin, cloyingly sweet, and barely spicy at all. They're not even cheap to make up for that.I didn't try the food, which I've heard is great, so I'm going to be generous and make it 3-star instead of 2. I'd get something from the full bar rather than a brew if I ever return, though.",3 star rating,Emily B.
