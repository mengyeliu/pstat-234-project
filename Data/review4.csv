5/19/2021,"Sacramento, CA",It's been years since my last visit and this location still rings to true to a complete SB experience. The large parking lot with free parking makes for easy access on weekdays in the spring and fall. In the summer months it can be a real challenge. Covid protocols lent to ordering beverages and appetizers to be consumed on the beach on one of many benches. Our table is ready buzzer went off much sooner than expected. The staff were top notch. Friendly as can be and very helpful and patient. WeTook out drinks and appetizers to a nearby bench and enjoyed the view of the surf with plentiful surfers doing their best to share the solid swells. Somme was very tasty. The oysters were so fresh and loaded with sea liquor. I enjoyed the accompaniments but was a little disappointed at the absence of a mingonette dipper. The sole was tasty and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The calamari appetizers were great and the dungeoness crab and shrimp ceviche tostadas sure hit the spot the citrus mango and cilantro brightmednthe tostadas to absolute perfection. So happy the establishment from my college days decades ago is still pumping out fantastic eats and drinks. Certainly spot to hit in the future now that southwest flys direct fromOakland.,5 star rating,David M.
4/19/2021,"San Fernando Valley, CA","Got the happy hour take out and enjoyed it on the beach for the sunset.Fried cauliflower - The even, thin coating of the breading was great! Loved the accompanying sweet and sour sauce that gave the cauliflower a zing.Lobster & truffle mac n cheese - The lobster pieces were big, but they were slightly mushy (which I totally understand - you're not going to get fresh lobster for mac n cheese). Flavor was great, cheesey, and the truffle blended in well without overpowering all the other flavors.Fried calamari - The calamari were on the small side, but they were tasty and fried well. The provided lemon had a good balance with fried bits.Wine - generous poursBlood orange margarita - They didn't skimp on flavor for sure.Moscow mule - Ginger-y, strongOverall great experience. Wish they had cup holders for the drinks though.",5 star rating,Cze T.
4/1/2021,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Three words: WORTH THE WAIT.Yes, anytime you come here, please expect a long wait. But it's because this place is THAT GOOD. Plus, you can walk out to the beach and wait there, in the most scenic, beautiful place of all.This restaurant is as beautiful as it is delicious. The patio seating is so gorgeous. Come for sunset for sure. The drinks: soooo good. The blood orange margarita was delicious and SUPER strong so make sure to Uber or have a designated driver hehe. Also the strawberry shrub drink was amazing. Super yummy, fruity, and spicy with a Kick of jalapeño. The food: we shared family style. The highlight was by far the lobster Mac and cheese (definitely order two of these because you'll definitely eat them both) and the fried cauliflower (sweet, spicy and delicious). Other honorable mentions were the coconut shrimp and steak frites!",5 star rating,Ali K.
5/23/2021,"San Francisco, CA","If you are foodie, you won't be impressed. You pay for the view, and need to wait for 2 hours for a water front table. Services can be more energetic and attentive. Everything can be better but if this is the post pandemic thing, I gave three stars only because I am grateful that we found a place to kill time in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Shell J.
5/23/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","They don't take reservations so the wait was around 1.5 hours when we checked in around 2pm. They do let you buy drinks at the bar to go so you can walk around the beach while you wait which we opted to do! The views are super nice and the drinks were good! We tried the mule and the boathouse punch and both were very good!For food we had the pulled pork grilled cheese which was a big hit, the shrimp tacos which were fresh and had an awesome sauce, and the ahi tuna starter with a side of mango sticky rice (this was the only option that fell flat for us! It came looking like a salad- the tuna was prepared well but the mango sticky rice was under cooked, not really ""sticky"" and just had some mango chunks thrown in) Overall we liked the majority of our food, the vibes, and the service was very good!",4 star rating,Liz V.
5/6/2021,"San Jose, CA","Pro tip: don't come hungry because you'll be waiting 2 hours to get seated.We came and got our name on the list, left, and hung out downtown.  We were definitely starving by the time our buzzer went off.  We came here for dinner, so it was getting a little too cold to hang out at the beach.  The host was super cool the entire time while letting guests know it's going to be a 2 hour wait.I came here for the fresh uni, which is really hard to get good qualities of in the bay area.  I had pretty high expectations, and they did not disappoint.  It's served on top of piece of scallop on a slice of blood orange.  I think all that just hides the taste of the uni, which, if fresh, is already pretty mild in flavor. So I ate the uni by itself to enjoy its flavor.  I thought the price wasn't too bad either. $22 is market price.  I've had a whole uni straight from the shell for $10 at a farmer's market in San Diego. So, I guess $22 isn't bad for restaurant markup.The apple walnut salad was really good.  Slightly heavy on the dressing for me, but it was still enjoyable.Oh, we also had the lobster bisque. One of the best I've had!  Definitely worth getting a cup. The seabass was delicious as well. Good texture on the fish. The sauce was awesome!!! Definitely the star of the dish.  It went well with the fish and the potatoes and asparagus. I was scooping up that sauce with every bite of everything!Glad I got the chance to dine here on my last night visiting SB.  Definitely worth the wait, like many on here have expressed.",5 star rating,Marlette C.
4/21/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","This was my second time here and I can't believe I didn't review at the first time!I absolutely love this place!!! The food, the ambiance, and the overall experience has been so incredible both times! The views are unbeatable, you get to eat dinner while looking out onto the ocean in Santa Barbara -- what could be better! They don't take reservations, and on weekends I can get very busy. Bring a blanket for the beach, you can even order appetizers and get drinks from the bar and take it to the beach with you while you're waiting.The food -- everything is AMAZING. Particularly memorable dishes here include the cauliflower, the lobster Mac and cheese and the poke! If you are here with a big group, get 2 of the lobster macs to share! The drinks -- the cocktails are so fresh, unique and delicious. The bartenders also have quite a heavy pour so make sure you have a designated driver with you!",5 star rating,Sarah P.
4/17/2021,"Las Vegas, NV","We flew in for the day and really wanted to try Hendrys based on the reviews, so glad we did!!The wait was a little long, which we knew it would be based off all the reviews! We were told 45 minutes on a Monday morning at 11am - given a little buzzer wrapped in plastic and told that we could order drinks from the bar and sit outside while we waited for our table! Say no more. We went to the walk up bar and I got a pineapple mimosa and he ordered a vodka oj with a splash of cran... but very good drinks and the bartender was super sweet! I don't think we even waited the full 45 minutes before the buzzer went off and we were lead to our high top table - benefits of not being a large group! Albert was our waiter, super friendly and attentive. The food was delicious... we still talk about the chowder fries! Definitely no shortage of lobster in the lobster mac and cheese either!!!",5 star rating,Melyna M.
4/11/2021,"Goleta, CA","I am honestly flabbergasted that I have not yet written a review for Hendry's/The Boathouse. No matter who you ask, this restaurant is bound to be mentioned when brunch options in Santa Barbara is discussed. Depending on who you ask, the name may change several times--especially since the actual beach's name is Arroyo Burro. This beach is what ""brings all the boys"", oh, and I suppose dog lovers too since the east half of the beach is pet-friendly.Whenever I have visitors in town, I am always sure to bring them here for a scenic brunch. The restaurant is smack dab on the sand between two tall bluffs with endless windows and views of the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands. If this isn't paradise, I don't know what is?! Weekends (Friday, Saturdays and Sundays) at Hendry's can be nuts, so I strongly advise everyone to visit either early right when they open or on a weekday to avoid a long wait. They do provide wireless pagers if you'd like to stroll the beach barefoot or hit up the shell staircase for elevated cliff views (located behind the restaurant to the west). It can be breezy so bring a light coat along since half the seating options are outdoors. There are heat lamps and a fire pit too. No matter what you order off the menu for breakfast you cannot go wrong: Chilaquiles, Crab Cake Benedict, Huevos Hope Rancheros, and the list of delicious options goes on... I also feel obligated to recommend Hendry's for their Breakfast Booze selection. Whether it be one their large variety of fruit-flavored mimosas (orange, grapefruit, blood orange, mango, and many more...), Espresso Martini (for when I need a morning caffeine kick), a Pancake Breakfast Shot (for those with a sweet tooth), ""I think I lost my headache"" Michelada (perfect hair of the dog), or Signature Bloody Mary (with a chilled prawn, applewood smoked bacon, pickled veg, and citrus; YES PLEASE!).While I have been here for lunch and dinner, I have to admit that I think they do breakfast/brunch the best.P/S: Shout-out to Jessica my favorite waitress!Psst: You can also order a boozy beverage to-go to stroll along the beach whether or not you decide to dine here.",5 star rating,Richie D.
4/2/2021,"Arcadia, CA","A friend of mine recommended this brunch spot as a ""MUST VISIT"" eatery and she was so right! It's the perfect little spot for a boozy brunch right by the beach. The wait can get quite long but you can grab an alcoholic drink to go and stroll along the beach - which allows dogs!! They quoted us an hour wait time but we were called back in 30 and were attended to super quickly once we were seated. We ordered the michelada and blood orange margarita, which didn't actually have a strong blood orange taste. Personally, I preferred the michelada and traded drinks with my bf LOL. We also got the pork belly Benedict and crab cakes. The Benedict wasn't too flavorful - it was as though the pork belly wasn't seasoned at all but we added lots of pepper to this dish. The crab cakes were AMAZING though!!! It actually ended up pairing well with the pork belly since it was on the more bland side. 10/10 would come again!",5 star rating,Ashley C.
3/25/2021,"San Diego, CA","One of my favorite meals in SB!  Beautiful restaurant along the ocean.  Husband and I shared the scallops & crispy pork belly appetizer.  For the price, I wish there were more than 2 pieces of each, there were lots of fillers like potatoes & sausage.  For what we received, it was delicious.  The main entrees of grilled mahi mahi and seared ahi tuna were cooked to perfection.  The fish were cooked and seasoned nicely, and the accompanied sides & veggies were tasty!  Get here early as the wait for dinner on a Monday was an hour!  Bring a jacket because it gets crazy cold & windy by the water.  My only complaint is service felt rather rushed.  I asked our server (blonde, curly-ish hair in a messy bun) how the scallops & crispy pork belly was and she responded, ""it's good""... not very friendly the whole night being that the price tag is rather high.  I'd come back for the food & views!",4 star rating,Cathee C.
2/24/2021,"Chula Vista, CA","This place is right on the beach and was splendid with the views. Pro tip, get here at least 5-10 min before they open (They open at 8AM) because there will be a line. Luckily we got here early and didn't have to wait.We enjoyed breakfast with a view of the beach.The food was just so-so though. I thought the french toast was pretty good, but we tried the omelette and didn't really like it. Not enough cheese, not enough flavor, and there was sort of this slimy consistency in the omelette that we didnt like either.Overall nice spot, worth a visit.",4 star rating,James E.
5/25/2021,"Dublin, CA","Over-rated with not worth waiting so long food and drinks. Apart from the  location which I think that too is better 2 miles down at the marina, nothing great about this place.",3 star rating,Hemal K.
5/25/2021,"Solvang, CA","Great place for a lunch or dinner it's a regular spot for me the food here is fabulous, fried Calamari and Ahi poke is a must here. And you get the best view of the beach and dog friendly restaurant and beaches",5 star rating,Patrick D.
4/13/2021,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","Definitely a MUST GO TO restaurant!  It was worth the wait...the ""waiting area"" was amazing, right by the beach, nice for that ocean breeze.  We're definitely going back and looking forward to it.",5 star rating,Dilenia A.
2/16/2021,"El Monte, CA","I'll start off by saying we are here on Valentine's Day at 5pm. So the wait times are VERY skewed. We waited about 3 hours, but let me tell you, the view is amazing and right near the sand. The restaurant was literally touching the sand which made for a great sunset dinner for anyone who is there. The food was great, for appetizers we got Chowder fries which were better than we expected. You can go wrong with fries, and clam chowder is great already on its own. But together is perfect. And we also got the calamari which is great. They gave us the body and the leg pieces so if you're grossed out my tentacles then don't get it For the entree, I got the seafood pasta, I wish the sauce wasn't so watery but it was still good. My girlfriend got the lobster roll which was fantastic. After dinner, we took some drinks to go and walked on the beach to enjoy the beach and sunset. Would come back again, but not if the 3 hour wait is there. Haha but then again it was Valentine's Day so in fault of their own.",5 star rating,Sherman C.
1/25/2021,"Vancouver, Canada","Had just an okay experience here with their takeout.I dined here in December 2020 when all indoor and outdoor dining was closed, so takeout was our only option.I've been to this beach before, so I knew there were some picnic tables right next to the restaurant. I thought it'd be nice to get some brunch takeout and eat on the tables nearby.My friend and I came on Saturday around 11:30, and there wasn't even a line. I guess most folks aren't interested in eating here without at least outdoor dining available. I've always wanted to try this brunch spot because of the fantastic location, so I was really excited.I wanted to try their corned beef hash, as it's one of my favorite brunch dishes, and was quite disappointed to hear it wasn't available on the day I went. They may be operating on a more limited menu during covid, since some other items on the menu were crossed out as not available.Instead, I went with the Boathouse Signature Breakfast ($17.95), which is essentially crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. I asked for the sauce to be provided on the side. It was pretty good, though having to eat it out of a takeout box did make it a bit harder to fully enjoy the meal.My friend ordered the cioppino off their lunch menu ($22.95). I tried some and was not a fan. Having had some amazing cioppino in San Francisco, the version here was completely different and had a sweet ketchup taste more than the delicious garlicky seafood flavor I've come to associate with the dish. It did come with a lot of seafood though, so at least they didn't skimp on that.One quick note about eating at the picnic tables nearby. It was incredibly windy on the day we went (I assume this is normal), so keep that in mind. Our napkins and empty bag kept getting blown away when we weren't paying attention.",3 star rating,Dianna H.
1/18/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Boathouse is a rightful staple sit-down restaurant in the Santa Barbara area. Its prices, although on the higher side, are well worth the food's portions, flavors, and creativity put into making them. And the servers are incredibly kind and accommodating. I love fish tacos, so I got those, but (although they were super tasty) I should've gone with my gut and gotten the Tuna Melt that my friend ordered. It had just the right amount of crunch, melt, moisture, and ZING of flavor. Too good!! The ceviche and shrimp were fresh and flavorful, and presented oh-so-beautifully. The only reason I put 4 stars is because of the wait... we were told we would wait an hour. Which was already stretching it, but it was understandable given the sheer amount of people waiting to eat at this place. We went for a walk on the beach, but when the hour had passed, there were still no tables to be sat at. An hour and a half into the wait, I decided to go up to the front and ask for the tables they hadn't assigned to anyone (since they were in direct sunlight). We were immediately seated! We all got a bit rosy/burnt (depending on our melanin levels) from sitting in the sun our entire meal, but at least it was away from the crowd and we got to eat! Definitely recommend going to this place at unconventional times/ days to avoid the wait. Or just be that group that doesn't mind sitting where no one else wants to sit!",4 star rating,Maria W.
1/11/2021,"Lynwood, CA","Amazing location right on the beach. Great drinks, I also got breakfast but they didn't have tapatio which I needed but it's understandable.

4/10/2021,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","This review is so long overdue. For the past 4 years, my boyfriend and I have been making special trips from LA to SB just to come to hendrys. It's ""our spot."" (Our family even got us Hendrys sweatshirts for christmas which I didn't know was a thing! That's how much we rave about this place). We love the atmosphere, the staff, the bartenders, the drinks & food, everything. We make a whole night out of coming here: we put in our names, expect to wait 1-2 hours (WORTH IT), and we grab drinks from their bar and walk along the beach for a bit. The atmosphere is calming and romantic, but also great for friends and family. My boyfriend said it best: you feel like you could be anywhere at Hendry's. You could be on a tropical island in the Caribbean, vacation in Hawaii, or at a local beach. The views are phenomenal, and the prices are actually very reasonable considering what you get! Definitely try to get there to see the sunset. There's nothing better than being at Hendry's for sunset. I recommend the desserts and specialty cocktails. They make a great Mule and Old Fashioned. Please, do yourself a favor, come here and enjoy the ocean while you wait. We will forever be returning. - Kelly & Joe",5 star rating,Kelly H.
5/13/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA",This is an amazing location to have a nice dinner. You're literally on the beach when you're waiting for a table (they don't take reservations at the moment). The food is just alright for the price,4 star rating,Valerie H.

I had kids, so we decided to order to go and eat at the lifeguard tower.  I had the ahi lettuce tacos and they were delicious. There were a lot of chow mein noodles (crunchy), so if you want to keep it light, order without. My kids had the spicy seafood pasta (yum!) and the salmon.

You can make a beach day out of it. Food is good, my friends plate was delicious according to her. Unfortunately my steak was pretty bland, but the mashed potatoes were good. Drinks are good, expensive but expected. Service is normal, friendly & timely. Would recommend, and I would go again.",5 star rating,Lucy M.
12/22/2020,"Dallas, TX","This place is perfect for having a romantic experience at the beach. We ordered the choppino, chowder fries, and their sea bass and boy was it wonderful. Although the food was boxed in to go the boxes were leak proof and made of recycled paper material so we were happy with it not leaking all over us on the beach. I really loved the choppino but it was a shame they didn't give us a claw cracker or our garlic bread. We didn't realize this until much later because we are the other dishes first however that's a pretty big mistake for such a fine establishment. I chalked it up to pandemic madness and didn't let it ruin my wonderful sunset dinner with my boo. I definitely recommend all the dishes we had there, the choppino was quite flavorful, the sea bass with black truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus still make my mouth water just writing this review, finally who doesn't like a good chowder with a side of bacon and fries to go with it?!I'd post pictures but in the box it's hard to find a presentable picture so here's a picture of our sunset!",4 star rating,Tim B.
5/7/2021,"Milpitas, CA","This was the last restaurant I had on my trip to SB and it did not disappoint! It was a Saturday around 11 and I was given an approx 1.5 hour wait time. I was instructed to come back at the 1.5 hour mark to grab a buzzer. The bar was open to grab drinks and enjoy them on the beach so that helped make the wait go by! Once I got the buzzer, it was probably close to 2 hours when we finally got seated (inside). There was a generous amount of spacing between parties which I appreciated a lot.Moving onto the food, this definitely made the wait feel justifiable. Every dish we ordered was AMAZING. To start off the meal, we got some poke nachos for an appetizer. The dish was so simplistic with a layered stack of seaweed salad, poke, avocado, and wonton strips with the wonton chips on the side. You could tell how fresh the poke was within every bite + loved how the seaweed salad and avocado complemented the poke! As for the mains, we ordered the seafood pasta and an angus burger. So many people recommended this pasta on Yelp and I 100% stand behind this rec. The sauce they used on the penne pasta was so unique and had a distinct kick to it. It was creamy without being overpowering and the seafood was SO GOOD. They really packed the shrimp, scallops, and white cod in there (scallops were my favorite!!). The burger had generous portions and was pretty hearty. Loved the aioli sauce they provided!If you're hesitant on visiting Boathouse because of the wait, I promise that it's completely worth it! The ambiance during when you get seated for your meal and even during your wait makes this a worthwhile experience!",5 star rating,Denise P.
5/26/2021,"Oklahoma City, OK","First of all the hundreds of other reviews are right! The wait was SO long! Waited an 1 hour and like 30-45 mins for 2 when they said the wait was about at most an hour. And by then we were starving but while waiting we got to walk around the beach, take pictures and enjoy each other's company. We also ordered drinks at the bar and it was all worth the wait and the food came out so fast because we ordered once we sat down. THE BEST seafood ever! I mean wow! It like melted in my mouth. Highly recommend coming here for the view and food. Great service just be prepared for the long wait!",5 star rating,Kelsey R.
5/16/2021,"Rancho Murieta, CA","The wait time here was ridiculous BUT... definitely worth it and also a beautiful coastline to walk while you wait. They aren't currently taking reservations, it's first come first serve so early arrival is suggested and definitely plan to be there for at least a couple of hours. You can order from the bar and drink by the beach while you wait. I had a bacon Bloody Mary because it comes with bacon and shrimp which held my hunger through the wait. The Ceviche tostadas are an order of 4 so I ordered 2 rockfish ceviche and 2 shrimp and dungeness ceviche. I am very picky when it comes to mariscos (seafood). These tostadas were really good. Lime cooked, not vinegar which is the way it should be!  For the shrimp & dungeness ceviche with mango, great is an understatement..they were amazing. The contrast between the sweet of the mango, the light spice from the pepper and the acidity from the citrus is my type of pallet explosion. My husband ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese and we had read it was really good but there was no way to explain how good it is except I share that it led to an eye roll to the back of my head ha ha. It literally melted in my mouth; crispy on the outside, you get a taste of the butter and the sweetness (not too sweet) pulled pork. Best pulled pork I've had. I would have ordered to-go but I already had to take 2 of the 4 tostadas since they are so packed with ceviche, 2 was all I could eat. Definitely a plate for 2 people. I also had an oyster shot to which I added some of my ceviche. If you've never tried that, do!! It's my fave and a great way to have a mariscos shot. We were there for my birthday so the waiter brought me honestly the best dessert I've ever had.. (there's a theme going).. I'm not a sweet out dessert person the least bit but this.. yep.. WOW!! Crunchy, robust coffee and chocolate flavored firm ice cream, unsweetened whipping cream topped with a rasberry, macadamia nuts and mint. Phenomenal. I will go back to Santa Barbara just to go back to Boathouse at Hendry's Beach.",5 star rating,Marcia T.
5/25/2021,"Corona, CA","We went on a Sunday and were told an hour and a half wait, which turned out to be over two hours. Good for them. I know they can't predict the wait time, just know weekends are crazy busy there.Once seated, service was exceptionally slow. Six people - one did not get their drink until half way through the meal. One person did not get their meal until the others had almost finished. They did comp the meal, but still!The food is adequate. Service terrible.

12/1/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","2020 Peoples Choice (Independent) WINNNNNNNER of:Best ViewBest Bloody MaryBest Sunday BrunchBest Happy Hour (bester in the winter)I agree on all points. Let's discuss.The best barstool in town and my personal oasis for chill, visit with strangers/regulars and the stellar crew here while staring at the ocean.Bars love to tout their Bloody Mary's. Here the hype is justified. Not a wet mess but a well rounded, spiced (not necessarily spicy cocktail). Filling and refreshing. Although not my go-to breakfast bevi here, they are worth ordering.Sunday Brunch or any morning meal at the beach is a WINNER. The gang knows my order:  Step in the Right Direction and the Signature Breakfast. Whatever you choose, you'll always have the view. Which is nice.Best Happy Hour is where you'll find me.

Or more specifically the clock.Daylight Savings Time (Summer): 3-6 Sunday through ThursdayWinter: 3-Close Sunday through Thursday a s some years a late night Friday optionThey specials save you a couple bucks but more importantly is who this brings in.

2/26/2021,"New York, NY","THANK GOD for the Boathouse. What a bright spot in a dark time (made darker by the lunacy of treating Santa Barbara County as part of a cluster, including Ventura County, which pushed back the reopening of patios a month or two). The Boathouse was always great but it's better than ever, with a wonderful breakfast menu (not just weekend brunch).  They don't take reservations right now so you're in for a wait if you go around sunset or on a weekend. I had happy hour for my birthday after misplacing my keys in a bookcase, so getting there late. Freezing at 48 degrees with an intense wind, though I have a high tolerance for cold.We didn't realize they did happy hour at 8pm (the wait was about 50 minutes) and Jordan treated us so wonderfully.  I had called earlier in the day and been told that if you go at 7pm, when it's pitch dark, the wait is 15 to 20 minutes. When we heard, even after the key fiasco, that it might be as long as 50 minutes, she comped a drink. (We would have gone elsewhere had we known and had to Uber). The HH prices are fantastic. And THE CAULIFLOWER is the best I've ever had. Not a dietetic dish, that. Decadent and unforgettable. I'm going back next week with a friend for a delayed celebration. Terrific wedge salad, too. We had the tostada de ceviche, which was good but not my favorite thing on the menu. The Black Manhattan was excellent and at 13 bucks (not a happy hour special, I don't think), a deal. Happy Hour white was just fine and it's a giant pour. I walk at this beach regularly (and waiting for the ocean temp to reach 62 so I can get back in the water), so even when I don't get something to go or eat there, the Boathouse is part of my daily life.",5 star rating,Victoria O.

You can see how nicely packaged everything is. The blood orange with the sea urchin is a very nice and unique touch. The seafood is made out of pure freshness. Coming from San Diego, I can't say the $16 fish tacos were outstanding, but I would still recommend the fresh seafood items.",5 star rating,Sophia S.
4/28/2021,"Poway, CA","A gorgeous spot tucked next to the dog beach, the Boathouse has stunning views, delightful cocktails (like the Blood Orange Margarita), and fresh seafood (try the Ahi Poke starter!). Like many others have mentioned, be prepared for a wait, but it is worth it. The wait for a 2 top on a Monday at 11:30am was 40 mins. I would be remiss for not mentioning two stellar employees: Brenden (sp?) the bartender, who patiently helped me select a sipping bourbon, and then continued to recommend ones I may also enjoy (which I did), as well as Jessica the server, who took the time and extra step to make sure I was ordering the appetizer I really wanted out of two similar sounding dishes. The two of them helped ensure that my first visit with my mother after over a year of quarantine was a special event. I will definitely be back!",5 star rating,Casey O.

I will say though, I ordered a michelada, cos we'll, I grew up with homemade style.

Nice spot on the beach to enjoy a nice dinner.Aware of the long waits, we got there around 4pm for dinner on a weekday and turns out there's no wait at that time and they were still serving the lunch menu! Clam chowder - Want something warm and hearty? Go for this. I think the bowl portion is good for an individual as an appetizer.Ahi Club - The components of the sandwich falls out easily. There are 3? large chunks of ahi tuna inside. Yay for fries!Now I don't know if my review would be the same if we did have to wait a long time to be seated.

Also the kids pasta was destroyed by my little one...The only disappointing dish was the kale salad, was not crispy enough and lack flavors.You should also try the boathouse mule which is to die for!This place wins for location and great food!",4 star rating,Eyal B.

3/5/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Went here for breakfast at around 9:30am. The wait time was perhaps 15 minutes which went by so quickly while soaking in the views. I got their eggs with biscuit, bacon and potatoes and really enjoyed everything on the plate. We also got a side of 1 pancake which was light and fluffy. I'd highly recommend this place for the views. The food is good but the view and vibe takes everything up a notch.",5 star rating,Anisha B.
10/21/2020,"Orange County, CA","3.5 stars***We were exploring SB on a Saturday and decided to stop here for dinner.  I'm not sure if they take reservations due to the limited capacity. Boathouse is located along the beach side which makes it a hot spot for ocean front dining.  The wait times were over an hour as quoted by the hostess.  For our party of 4, we were seated in 45 minutes.Our server was pleasant and attentive.  We ordered some cocktails first which were just OK.  We had a boathouse punch, an old-fashioned and knockout (forgot the name).  Our group had the New England Clam Chowder.  The soup was the best part of our meal.  The entrees were not noteworthy. We ordered these entrees:***Clam Linguini: clams were skimpy and tiny.  The sauce was bland.***Pork belly and scallops from the starters menu.  The scallops were pan seared and could have had more flavor.  The pork belly was not good.***New York Frites: basically steak and fries.  It was not bad.***Scallops with lobster and crab risotto: I would skip this!  The risotto was drenched in a spicy tomoto that was meh.If you want a beautiful ocean view then this is the restaurant.  The food was not that great.  It's definitely a nice place for date night if you want to catch the sunset.",3 star rating,Linh C.

2/8/2021,"Irvine, CA","We came here for brunch over the weekend and boy was it busy. They have 2 small parking lots that you can park for free. They didn't allow reservations so we put our name down and they quoted us 1hr 15 min. It was a nice area to wait since it is right on the beach. One side of the beach allows dog and the other side (restaurant) side does not allow dogs. So it was really nice to walk along the beach and watch the dogs playing in the sand. After an hour, our table was ready! We were seated at a high top which was fine since we were just hungry. Some of the things that we wanted to try were the uni platter, clam chowder, and the calamari. For the entrees, we ordered the pork belly benedict and the crab cake benedict. The uni platter was a bit disappointing. It didn't have that creamy taste to it and was kind of tasteless. It was paired with a scallop on top of a slice of grapefruit. The clam chowder was really good and creamy. It had a lot of clams and potatoes which made it pretty thick. Lastly the calamari was light and crispy. It was really good with some grilled shittake peppers and fried onions. The pork belly benedict was good, it was not as fatty as expected though. It came with cubed potatoes and poached egg. The crab cake was my favorite. It was very flavorful and crispy. The dish came with potatoes and  and a poached egg. The poached egg was cooked a little too well done since the yolk was a bit solid and didn't ooze out. We also got the moscow mule was was really good. It didn't taste like it had much alcohol though. Overall, our server was very attentive and nice. He made sure we had drinks and our food came out in a timely manner. We really enjoyed our meal on the beach with a nice view of the beach.",4 star rating,Vanessa T.
11/13/2020,"Anaheim, CA","My parents and I enjoyed this place. The food was so delicious. Appetizers were amazing!! We ordered the fried calamari, clam chowder fries, and crab cakes. We devoured the appetizers like it was the main course. We were surprised we had enough room for at least half of the main course. As for the main course, I had the impossible burger, my dad had fish and chips, and my mom had the crab pasta. Portions are big enough to share. Food all around was DELICIOUS!!! Service was amazing. The hostess were really nice. Told us the wait was 30-45 mins but ended up to be 15 because a table opened up. Our waiter was super nice too. Always made sure we were satisfied. Just got a little confusing with all the different servers bringing us food. But all in all, service was good. The scenery was beautiful. I mean not much to see but sand, people, and the water, but unless you're a nature person like me, you'd definitely appreciate the view. Definitely would recommend this place any time to anyone",5 star rating,Abby-Icy M.
10/22/2020,"Vallejo, CA","My 100th Yelp review and first time trying Boathouse! Definitely the best brunch I've had in a long time. Yes you'll have to wait in line, my party waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday around 11am. But you're allowed to order drinks as you wait (which makes time go by a little faster) and the restaurant is literally on the beach! So if you're dressed appropriately, you could spend your time waiting on the beach. As an added bonus, they're dog friendly so bring your pup! Onto the food  - I ordered their crab cake Benedict and it was amazing. Definitely lives up to the hype. It comes with potatoes, pico de gallo, and sliced avocado. Best crab cakes I've had and the eggs were poached well and were still runny. If you come here for brunch and don't have a shellfish allergy you need to order the crab cakes!",5 star rating,Sean D.
10/10/2020,"Santa Ana, CA","We waited TWO HOURS for a table, and it was worth it. This restaurant is located right on the beach, so you can easily pass the time taking a walk and enjoying the fresh open air. Ceasar salad 3/5: Nothing special, but still a good appetizer for some greens. Clam chowder bowl 5/5: Delicious! Thick, creamy, and filled with yummy bits of clams, scallops, and mussels. Very flavorful and fillingSeafood pasta 4/5: A light and creamy tomato sauce with nicely cooked al dente pasta. Came with chicken, scallops, and shrimp. The garlic bread was soft, and I wish it was crispier! Fish tacos 3/5: Had high hopes for this dish and was rather disappointed. The fish was moist and fresh, but lacked in flavor. I had to drench the taco in the accompanying tartar sauce for more flavor and pizzazz. Lobster roll 5/5: This was my first lobster roll ever, and it was delicious! The bread was perfectly toasted, crunchy, and garlicky. It was loaded with lobster pieces, which was mixed with mayo and tomato. The Cajun fries were also crispy and very addicting!",4 star rating,Shirley H.
2/15/2021,"Berkeley, CA",Wow. This place is in the state park. Right on the water.  Beautiful ocean views and they have a great happy hour weekdays and on holidays.  You can order over the phone and take the food to the beach if you come prepared with a beach blanket or other chairs. Try the chilaquiles they are amazing and the burgers here are pretty good too.  This place is nothing of a culinary exquisite experience but the views and natural surroundings are remarkable. Drinks are nice too and they have a full bar.Only bad thing is that they charge 15% service charge for staff (tip) even if you are doing pick up/take out.,5 star rating,David C.

9/29/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Boathouse is a fabulous spot. Located right on Hendry's Beach - The Pit to locals - it possibly has the best brunch in town, most likely the best Bloody, and definitely the friendliest bartender, Vic. They have a smoked salmon plate that is super, an eggs Benedict with crab cakes that is as good as it sounds, and pretty good chilaquiles, though I wish they offered it with red sauce. There are also great options for lunch and dinner. As you would expect for one of the only true beachside restaurants in SB, it is almost always crowded. They have adjusted well to Covid and offer a good amount of seating, but you will almost always be looking at a 30-60 minute wait unless you go early for breakfast. Service is always friendly and you can cruise the beach till your seat is ready, but don't go hungry and there aren't reservations. Really great spot though.",5 star rating,Dare H.

The pasta was super tasty and creamy. The only problem was that the portion of it was so small! I ate it in less than 5 minutes. I felt like for the price, they should've given more. If not the seafood, at least the pasta noodles. It had like 3-4 shrimps, a little bit of fish and one scallop. Pretty disappointed but at least it tasted good.",3 star rating,Jennifer N.

CARROTS!- The predominant flavor was rancid cheese and it was otherwise unflavored. I already mentioned both of those things above, but they felt worth repeating. - They didn't refund me for the omelet or offer to make a new one or apologize or express regret or anything like that. - The hostess was also rude.",1 star rating,Aaron C.

We decided to order takeout and really distance ourselves from the crowded outdoor dining area. The tables/seats are somewhat spaced out but with so many bodies, it just looked crowded to us.Once we got our meal, we just took it up to the ""rock steps"" that are located behind the restaurant, and just had our meal up there, enjoying the view! There is a small bench-type seating area there so we were able to sit and eat our meal without any crowds.Our choices were delicious! I mean, can you really go wrong with lobster & shrimp in your omelet?!! It may not be a combination you'd normally think would be good, but it is in fact delicious! The crab cakes eggs benedict were full of flavor and the combination with the custom sauce made it all taste delicious!The prices are a bit on the steaper side but for a once in a while splurge, it's a yummy treat!",5 star rating,Nancy L.
5/12/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA",One of my all time favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. The ambiance is just stunning. Their service is quick and fast. They have my favorite dish and it's the salmon for dinner or lunch. Boathouse has a secret menu for the for those non fish lovers and other dishes that support your preferences. Beautiful location right on the beach next to a dog washing station when you're coming back from the beach. I would recommend to go for the lunch to get that amazing view of Hendry's Beach and best of luck with the parking because you share a parking lot with the beach but they have a fairly large parking lot. They do have indoor/outdoor dining to accommodate your party size. Would always come back to this place,5 star rating,Andrew L.
9/22/2020,"Rosemead, CA","Cute little spot right on the beach with exclusively outdoor dining. My partner and I got lucky and got a spot facing the ocean. We weren't super hungry so we just got a couple of appetizers.The oysters? The best we've ever had so far. We asked for their sweetest selection and their waitress gave a spot-on recommendation. The lobster Mac and cheese was flavorful and had me wanting more. And the coconut shrimp had really coconut cooked into the breading, elevating it above other restaurants. We ordered a Cesar salad and our waitress forgot to put in the order, so we were already done with our food when she came by. She's so sweet and brought out our salad anyways but removed it from the bill as an apology.Overall a wonderful experience both food and service-wise and will return in the future.",5 star rating,Janelle R.

1/20/2021,"San Francisco, CA","We recently ordered takeout from the Boathouse and loved how everything was packed. We went during the weekend at lunch and the parking lot was packed. Wish they had a curbside pickup parking spot since it took us a while to get a spot. Between the four of us, we ordered a few dishes to share and portion-wise it was just perfect. Cioppino - This dish was pretty good for the price. There was a wide variety of seafood and it was nicely packed in the box. We were worried that it would leak out but they pack it pretty well by lining the inside of the box with foil. Grilled Fish of the Day (Sea Bass) - The sea bass was perfectly cooked and we loved the sides that came with it. Seafood Pasta - The seafood pasta dish comes with scallops, shrimp and fish but oddly ours only had scallops and shrimp (not complaining though!). The spicy marinara cream sauce was delicious! Fish Taco - The fish taco was okay. Of the dishes we ordered, we definitely liked the other ones more than this dish.",4 star rating,Charlene L.

8/11/2020,"San Jose, CA","(TLDR: LONG WAIT. heavy [weight- and grease-wise] seafood dishes. At least $40 per person!)Came here with the gals during covid. We waited 2.5 hrs y'all. (Mostly due to the social distancing lower capacity rule.) The restaurant is right on a beach where a lot of people go to wait. We literally went to the beach, left to get ice cream at Mission St Creamery, came back and took Linkedin photos by the beach, sat for a bit in the car, and THEN we were finally called up. hahaha!We shared the clam chowder, lobster mac, seafood sampler, clam linguine. Clam chowder was super on point -- just really solid, good ol' clam chowder. The lobster mac was SUPER DANK. IT'S A MUST-GET! Trust me on this one. However, the seafood sampler was pretty underwhelming. It consisted of various clams, shrimps, and oysters, as well as small dishes of ceviche and poke. Everything on the platter was just decent, and we enjoyed the oysters, but I just expected more from them in terms of freshness and portion. Lastly, the clam linguine was (hooooo boy) she was greasy! It was super yummy at the time of consumption, but we definitely couldn't finish it. When I warmed up the leftovers for lunch the next day, there was (I kid you not) a pond of oil chillin in the takeout box, coating the entire portion. Did I see that and finish it anyway? I think you know.The interior was actually super nice! The huge mirror along one side really made the restaurant seem massive. The other side had a window all across, giving a panorama of the shore. A couple was out there talking and I felt like I was watching the Bachelor. Service was super attentive. For covid measures, all employees wore masks and they had hand sanitizer at every table.",4 star rating,Jocelyn S.
2/2/2021,"Santa Clarita, CA","Can I just say, the location of this restaurant was so refreshing, a much needed little escape from home. The outdoor seating was properly distanced and they provided hand sanitizer at every table. My friend and I split the crab cakes and cioppino for brunch, and the crab cakes by far were our favorite. Crispy, not too heavy, and went surprisingly well with their hollandaise. The variety of seafood in their ciopinno was also great, but it came out a little cold. Overall, a great first experience at this local spot!",4 star rating,Kaelyn R.
8/3/2020,"Costa Mesa, CA","My mom claimed she made a reservation months ago, but the hostess and manager claimed they didn't take reservations.  Perhaps this was a COVID thing and they usually do take reservations?  Regardless, they still sat us, which saved everyone from being unhappy.  Wait time was 2+ hours on a Friday night.  Outside seating only during the pandemic.  Mask required upon entry, but you can remove it at the table.  Friendly service.  Beautiful views right on the dog beach.  We found free parking in the beach lot, but good luck, as you never know if you'll find a spot.  Give yourself some extra time to find parking.Complimentary bread and butter, which is awesome!  If I was paying, my orders would've been different, but mom was paying for my bday.  Kinda pricey if you ask me.  We tried several apps, including lobster mac, poke, clam chowder, and grilled mahi mahi salad.  Split between 4 people and we enjoyed them all.  Almost didn't leave enough room for the main course, which was bacon wrapped filet mignon.  It came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  Loved!  They even gave a little complimentary dessert for my bday - nice touch!",5 star rating,Spencer S.

Of course, now with dining in out of question, it does not mean that their food doesn't hit the spot. I've always enjoyed their oysters, calamari, clam chowder, poke, Manila clams, chowder fries and lobster Mac and cheese to name a few (are you drooling yet?!). The service has always been great, feel free to dress casual as well, and enjoy a great location of a restaurant once things are back to normal.

After finishing our food, the buss boy cleared our table (asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks since we hadn't seen our waiter since we placed our order) and then took 20 minutes to come ask us if we wanted our check. We wouldn't come again, but the location is beautiful. Just wish the food would match the location.",2 star rating,Victoria M.
3/11/2021,"Corte Madera, CA","The Boathouse is a great restaurant tucked into a cove in Santa Barbara. I was there back in October 2020 with my girlfriend and originally went for breakfast, but due to the long wait (1.5-2 hours on a Sunday for a table for two) ended up having lunch. You'll want to keep that in mind and go early otherwise the menu will change and you'll be forced to pick from other options that you didn't originally plan for. The beach is beautiful, but busy with families and dogs (only half of the beach was dog-friendly). After putting down your name on the waiting list, definitely grab some drinks at the bar and relax on some benches looking out at the ocean. There was a good mix of indoor and outdoor dining, given the circumstances of 2020, and the service was great. They were attentive and helped move an umbrella once the sun started burning my neck haha! We ordered the Angus Burger ($14.95) and the Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese ($15.95). They were both big portions, but nothing to revel about. The burger was huge and can be easily split with someone or taken home for leftovers. The grilled cheese was misleading since it wasn't very cheesy and felt like a regular meaty sandwich with one slice of cheese. While the food was okay, I don't think it justified the price and it's clear that you're definitely paying a price for the location and the view.",4 star rating,Corey D.
11/25/2020,"Las Vegas, NV","Santa Barbara is a quintessential beach town.  The proximity to tons of beaches, fun downtown and super cool trails/hikes up the San Ynez mountains makes it ideal for a travelers getaway. Every time we goto SB, always make it point to stop by Hendry's as it encapsulates a lot of what makes this city so charming. Hendry's is located literally on the (Arroyo Burro) beach, as in if you sit at certain spots outside, it looks like the tide is approaching your feet which I love. Food here is excellent and fresh. Last visit we tried their happy hour, got the ceviche tostadas which were huge and of different variety (rockfish, shrimp and crab), but what really stood out was the chowder fries, hot nice chunks of fry, covered in delicious chowder, topped with chunks of bacon, enough for 3-4 imo really hit the spot.

7/3/2020,"Fayetteville, AR","You can beat the views at this spot! The restaurant is located at a secluded beach literally right on the sand with huge windows. They have indoor seating and an outdoor patio, which can be a bit chilly in the evenings. They're food is delish and reasonably priced for the location! They have 1 vegan dish on the menu. It's was really pretty but not the best thing I ever ate. I still give them 5 stars though because you don't come here for their vegan food, you come for the seafood. My boyfriend had never there and loves seafood so I had to take him.",5 star rating,Shana S.

11/15/2020,"Sunnyvale, CA","This place is right next to the beach and they have outdoor seating right by the ocean! We came here on a Friday night, an hour before closing, and were seated quickly.The dropkick was recommended by our server and we were pleasantly surprised at how well the drink was made. I don't usually enjoy spicy cocktails but I would definitely recommend trying this drink.The oysters, although on the pricier side, were probably the best oysters I've ever had. They had a few selections but we picked the ""less briny""oysters from British Colombia and they were fresh, plump and had a creamy sweetness to them. We also enjoyed the crab cakes, pan seared scallops (the scallops was slightly undercooked but the risotto was fantastic), and the seabass.",5 star rating,Lynnette N.
5/3/2020,"San Jose, CA","I think this spot was THE most beautiful restaurant I've been to in Santa Barbara. Bluewater Grill looks like a photo from Better Homes and Gardens magazine and was super cozy, but what really stood out to me about Hendry's is its isolation. The beach looks so serene and I went an hour before sunset. Absolutely gorgeous.Went here for happy hour and the service was very friendly. Although I think it's kind of weird how the tables were set up because we couldn't sit inside; happy hour was just at the bar and the outdoors tables but 1) it was SUPER cold and 2) there were WAY too many people to fit for happy hour. Got the drink of the day (Moscow mule) and chowder fries. Never had chowder fries before and they're exactly what their name is. It tasted great though. The chowder was quite thick and bacon-y and at first, I was skeptical because I was thinking of soggy fries. However it ended up feeling like gravy and mmMmMmmM sooo good. The mule was overly ginger-y for my taste. The server was nice, we sat and watched him do his thing. A bit hard to get his attention sometimes (even though we sat in front of him lol) and we were definitely the only college students there.",4 star rating,Michelle V.

11/2/2020,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA","Had my birthday dinner at the Boathouse and the food was amazing. They do not always accept reservations but we were able to walk in and be seated quickly on a Sunday night since they had seating on their outdoor patio and 6 feet apart indoors. The restaurant is directly on the beach so you can walk on over after dinner. We ordered the Steamed Manila Clams as an appetizer, which was well portioned and filled with buttery goodness. I got the Grilled Scottish Salmon which had the most amazing lobster mash potatoes on the side. My partner got the Pan Seared Scallops which came with another amazing side of lobster and crab risotto. Overall, probably some of the best seafood I've ever had. Our waitress Danielle was also great. There was another party celebrating a birthday as well and they were crowding the indoor bar without masks, and our waitress proactively moved them to an outside area away from the inside patrons. She then comped our drinks as an apology (totally unnecessary but greatly appreciated) for the minor disturbance. Always great to have staff who go above and beyond for their customers and really create a safe and enjoyable experience.Definitely look forward to coming back to Boathouse when I'm in the area.",5 star rating,Scott S.

If I close my eyes and concentrate I can still taste them. Such a flavorful and layered dish... there's even bits of lobster and crab in the risotto. The kids LOVED their kids menu pasta dish.  When their plates came I thought ""no way they finish that,"" but mom's can be wrong.

3/28/2021,"Snoqualmie, WA","This is my first time to this restaurant. I was recommended the location by a friend. I was honestly put off by the no reservations policy it first and the fact that there was an hour and a half wait on a Sunday evening through even a generic table. But what I found was a friendly staff that I was beyond impressed by. Nicole and Demi at the front were very kind and inclusive. Considering the long wait they were extremely friendly and understanding. On the way to the table, The manager Jordan was kind enough to say hello and welcome us. I'm always impressed when I see a working manager not just somebody sitting in a corner watching. Jordan was very attentive at the front desk helping her employees.Please remember this is my first time and they don't know me at all and have no reason to take great care of me other than I'm just a normal guest. When I got to the table we were created by Ariel, very kind and extremely knowledgeable waitress. In moments where I couldn't figure out exactly what I was trying to order she was quick to guide me. When we ordered a bottle of wine she knew exactly which bottle it was without even looking at the menu. Again very knowledgeable and extremely friendly.The food was tasty from appetizers which included the shrimp cocktail, coconut shrimp and the ahi poke. Macadamia macadamia nut in crusted halibut I believe it was, was also mouthwateringly delicious.Bottom line food, service, presence all five stars.",5 star rating,Kamran M.

3/5/2020,"Oxnard, CA",If you are looking for a breathtaking spot to have a romantic meal this is the place. Located on a beautiful spot right on the sand and on the water's edge in Santa Barbara. There is a nice parking lot but at certain times of the day it gets full as people park there to walk on the beach. Especially on weekends and sunset. The restaurant is quaint with just as much patio seating as indoor seating. They have heaters located everywhere but it can still get a bit cool depending on the weather so dress accordingly. We went on a Weds night and they were full and we had to sit next to the entrance and hosted station. Kind of a bummer. The service was good and our waiter was very friendly and attentive even though they were busy. We started with the ahi poke on a bed of seaweed salad with crispy wontons which was good. My husband has the Caesar salad and clam chowder. The Caesar was bland and the chowder was just ok. I didn't think it was very creamy. Could of been and should of been way better for a restaurant in SB on the water. I had the scallops on crab and lobster risotto with brocollini. The scallops were so fishy! Yuck!! The risotto was ok but nothing special. The brocollini was tough. So disappointing. The high light of the evening was the creme brûlée dessert. Perfect brûlée on top with a nice creamy vanilla custard. I should of just ordered 10 of those and called it a night.,3 star rating,Azusa S.
9/8/2020,"Pinal County, AZ","From start to finish, everything was highly enjoyable about this visit.  First of all, it's a beautiful setting right on the beach.  Second, the service was very very good.  Third, the food was not only delicious, but nicely presented.  My friend ordered the chicken salad and I ordered a crab Louie salad.  Instead of being all mixed together, each ingredient was placed in its own space in the bowl, so you could mix or not as you chose. And they did not skimp on the crab.  The presentation of the salad mixings was so attractive that people at another table asked us what we ordered so that they could order the same.  No matter if it's during Covid times or not, there is usually a lonnnnggg wait for tables (1-2 hrs), so you may want to rethink dinner or lunch time.  The Boathouse does not take reservations.",5 star rating,Candice S.

If you like seafood, this is a must visit in Santa Barbara. Unfortunately, I don't eat seafood and I was limited to 2 or 3 items in the lunch menu. I went for their Burger and it was easily one of the best burgers I've had in Santa Barbara (Next only to eureka). Their fries was good as well. The wait time was about 2 hours for a lunch on Saturday, but it was totally worth the wait. Who complains to wait on the beach? This place don't take reservation, so you cannot escape the wait if you're there on a busy day. The staff were very friendly and accommodating of all the requests we had.

Plenty of parking with spacious seating indoors and outdoor on the patio. Service was friendly and attentive. Menu is extensive and had great offerings. I ordered the ""Boathouse signature breakfast"" which has poached eggs on a bed of crab cakes (crab cake eggs Benedict). It was absolutely delicious. The chipotle hollandaise sauce paired nicely with everything. Loved the potatoes, pico de Gallo, and avocado. I loved every single bite. Been here twice (only for breakfast) and enjoyed my experience/food every time. I also had their eggs Benedict with pork belly and their deconstructed smoked salmon lox / bagel platter and liked it very much. Not sure if they still have this on their menu??

I suggest sitting on the benches outside over the beach to watch the sunset and have a drink before dinner. The food was amazing. Good sized portions for the price and great quality.

The view and the open air was really nice and made you feel like everything was fresh since you're right there near the water.I love how they have a little side window for beach goers to order and eat on the beach.Great place by the beach and it wasn't too crowded for both the restaurant and the beachside.",5 star rating,Trina G.
10/15/2020,"Walnut, CA","Friends and I were looking for a great brunch spot while doing a day trip at Santa Barbara and I found this place via Yelp. It had indoor and outdoor seating, we opted for outdoor seating since the weather was beautiful, not too hot or cold. They don't take reservations, it's first come, first serve so it was over an hour wait when we asked to be put on the list on a Sunday around 10:30AM.Luckily, we had other plans to blow off the time, although when we came back, parking was tough to find. The lot is shared with the beach so it gets full fast due to it being relatively small. We lucked out and found prime parking right in front of the restaurant. We were promptly sat after we parked. The table they gave us was pretty small though, I wish that they had given us a bigger table for 6 of us since with all the food we ordered, it was hard to eat (almost elbow to elbow) and the plates were all past the edge.I ordered the crab tostada ceviche and vegetable omelette that came with a side of country potatoes while the boyfriend ordered their crab cake benny. I was surprised by how large their portions were, if I had known I would've ordered less LOL (I sadly didn't finish the ceviche and ended up being tossed, my poor $17...). The ceviche was tasty, with fresh shrimp, salsa, diced mangos, etc. It was very refreshing as an appetizer. It came with three (large) servings, I only managed to eat one.As for the main entrée, everyone loved their country potatoes, it was the highlight of the meal. It was so savory and delicious, cooked with great seasoning. My omelette was okay mostly because of my preference, I realized that the mushrooms they used were not my favorite. It was super earthy and bitter, decided not to waste more food and finished it. The portion was still very filling though.Last, but not least, everyone also loved the patio atmosphere. The staff was friendly and very helpful (friend had a lot of questions about their uni), sitting beachside and having brunch with friends on a Sunday morning... Felt really relaxing.

9/22/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Before I get to the actual review, I'd like to state that the ONLY reason why this place got 2 stars are for two specific reasons: 1) The location- its right by the water & the scenery is very nice. BUT it's also located right by a dog beach, so if you are terrified of dogs, this isn't the place for you because dogs running around everywhere. I didn't mind because I'm an animal lover. 2) There is tons of parking. You just have to drive carefully because it's narrow & dogs & kids are running around. Now for my actual review... the waiters/waitresses are NOT attentive whatsoever. I asked for a hot tea & the waitress admitted she forgot, then she said that it had gone out to the wrong table by accident. By the time I got my hot tea, we were half way done with our lunch. My friend asked for ranch, which never came out. There were 4 of us & we were hungry. So we ordered oysters, mussels, & ceviche as an appetizer. All I gotta say is: BLAND AND TASTELESS! The ceviche was very dry & the tostadas were stale. I personally ordered their lobster roll which basically means a cold lobster salad I would buy prepackaged from the supermarket on top of a piece of lettuce placed on top of a garlic flavored bread which was the only good tasting food. Long story short, not going back unless I want garlic bread of fries. I would recommend going to the dog beach if you own a dog but take your own food & drinks!",2 star rating,Tina P.

I'll be back to try something else, but I'm not drooling thinking about it now. The meat was pretty good and it came with fries. Overall, very filling.

2/2/2020,"Austin, TX","I thought since we opted out of an opportunity to be seated outdoors, we would be ripped away from the calming ambience of the Pacific Ocean waves. However, to my surprise, we knew we made the right decision after being awed by beautiful views, with a controlled temperature. We arrived during that awkward time between breakfast and lunch, but not wanting brunch, so we chose lunch instead. There wasn't a single thing that was a miss at The Boathouse at Hendry's. With consent, I picked off of everyone's items at the table. From the Fish & Chips, The Seafood Pasta, and The Chilean Sea Bass, everything was amazing. The Fish & Chips-- fried to perfection. Excellent breading, not overwhelming. The Sea Bass was a healthier option, but the fish flaked off just as easily. The mashed potatoes gave the entree a nice finishing touch.",4 star rating,Christina H.
8/28/2020,"Porter Ranch, Porter Ranch, CA","Summary: All in all, good food and drinks, nice scenery, but unacceptable and disappointing service and accommodations. For more details, read on:COVID-19 has certainly presented many challenges to the dining industry. It has stressed their systems to a point where well-managed organizations shine through and others badly manifest their shortcomings. The Boathouse at Hendry's Beach is an example of the latter.Location 3: It is located on a nice rather small public beachfront. Views of the ocean are nice and close by, but not pristine as you are primarily looking at a crowded beach with people, umbrellas and beach chairs. The only parking option is a small, very busy public beach parking lot, which is free but very hard to find a spot on, even on a weekday.Food 4: We were there for a weekday lunch and had the Lobster Bisque, the Fish Taco, the Shrimp Taco, the Half-pound Burger, and the Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich. All were delicious! I would love to try their breakfast as the menu looked really good but they do not serve breakfast all day.Drinks 4: Full bar. Good selection of specialty drinks at reasonable prices, along with wine and beer on tap. Value 4: Food and drinks were reasonably priced and on par with similar establishments.Service 1~2: To comply with social distancing regulations, they have been limited to outdoor seating which reduces their capacity. They (to their admission) do not have sufficient umbrellas to keep all tables shielded from the scorching SoCal sun, rendering some of their tables unusable during the daytime. This, along with guests enjoying their time too much to leave, creates a bottleneck. This is all understandable but the way the organization deals with these challenges is rather unpolished. First off, they have closed down their guest restrooms and ask everyone to use the beach's rather unpleasant public restrooms. For a full service restaurant and bar, this is unacceptable. They also do not take reservations, and are not good at all in estimating wait times. We arrived at 2PM on a Thursday which is not exactly a peak time for lunch or dinner, and were told that the wait time was 45 minutes. In reality we did not sit down until 2 hours after leaving our name at the reception!!! We approached the reception hostesses a few time to inquire, and while they were polite, they were not very helpful. We were told a few times within the two hour wait that we were next but lo and behold that next table never became available . I witnessed a large Birthday Party group having a heated discussion with the staff regarding their long wait (which was less than ours; one and a half hour) and this resulted in victory as they were given the next available table! Interesting enough, the same manager who had allowed the earlier guests to stay around for hours and was unable to quote accurate wait times, suddenly decided to swing the pendulum too far and became overly aggressive, walking around and asking guests to leave just as they finished their meals. Last but not least, our server was nice and friendly, but not very attentive.",3 star rating,Ara G.
1/24/2020,"San Luis Obispo, CA","Disappointing Service. I have been here several times over the last 3 years. Of course everyone goes for the view! The food is good. The drinks are probably good (I go at lunchtime and am driving, so I don't have drinks).Today was different. The staff were completely unfriendly. It was a beautiful day, and the place was packed. The 3 people at the hostess desk were not smiling and were very curt. The main hostess asked me if I wanted to be inside or out. I said that whichever was more helpful for them, since I was just one person. I was put in a far corner of the patio....and I understood. But no friendliness. No warmth. She just emotionlessly said to the other the table number. They were all like that...with an generation gap!The older staff were very friendly. I could see them behaving like service staff should. All of the younger staff - those who helped me and those I observed - were surly and unfriendly. It wasn't even so busy that they couldn't handle the flow.That was the staff.My food was OK. I got the Ahi Club. The sandwich was fine. The fries were lukewarm. That is odd for busy times. One would think that at peak times, fries are coming straight out of the fryer.The other issue was wifi. There is guest wifi, but it doesn't work. This is a place where there is limited signal. I had none. I don't mind not having a signal. But if a place has wifi, then it should work.I like the place, but they shouldn't rely on their location to justify bad service.",3 star rating,Ian D.
4/22/2021,"San Jose, CA","First of all, the beach front location is nice. You can sit around outside on the beach nursing a drink or some appetizers if  there is a wait for your table, which was exactly what we did. Food are excellent too. There is a big fire pit in the courtyard and almost every table on the patio has a gas heating lamp. We missed the happy hour (3-6pm), but will try next time.",5 star rating,Winston T.

The wait was about an hour for 2 people even on a Monday due to limited outdoor seating but you can get to go cocktails and enjoy the views of the dog beach while you wait! The time flew by!

Appetizers were tasty, my bf enjoyed oysters and we shared the pork belly and scallops. Then came dinner. I ordered the ribeye it came with scalloped potatoes, spinach, and asparagus I was so excited, but that didn't last long. My potatoes we cold, like from the fridge cold in the middle. And still a little crunchy. I told my server and she offered to reheat them or replace them with something else. She took them back and I cut into my steak only to find it well done instead of medium like I asked. But by then it was already well after closing. I told her about the steak and she asked me what I wanted to do. I said just to take it back because I didn't want to make the staff stay longer.In the end I had high hopes and I left waiting over an hour for no dinner.",2 star rating,Micaela R.

9/4/2020,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA","Long wait for scenic outdoor dining. It took 40minutes. Food was pricey but delicious minus the vegetables. First we had appetizers- the coconut shrimp was delicious, clam chowder just ok. I ordered a grilled mahi mahi with curry sauce and mango rice. It came with vegetables 1/2 which were delicious and the other half were spoiled. I had to spit the vegetables out. I did notice a color difference in the broccoli before I ate it but didn't think anything of it. Had it not been so busy I would have asked for new vegetables. Overall enjoyed the food and ambiance but would have preferred a less busy time. We came Wednesday night.",4 star rating,Brenda M.

7/9/2020,"Washington, DC","My friends and I came here for a joint birthday celebration and waited over 1.5 hours, but it was worth it honestly. With COVID going on, it was still extremely packed on a Friday night. Overall, I really liked how they didn't skimp on any seafood in entrees.Split between us 4, our total was about $45 per person from sharing appetizers and getting our own entrees. We shared the lobster& truffles mac, raw seafood platter (small), and clam house made chowder (new england style). All of these were SO DELICIOUS, especially the lobster & truffles mac - hands down the best, most flavorful mac in my life. They did not skimp on any lobster and truffles either. The raw seafood platter was very expensive even for the small, and was definitely our least favorite because the average-tasting raw seafood wasn't worth the price. It came with a few each of clams, oysters, mussels, giant shrimp, poke, and ceviche. My friends liked the clams most, but I liked the oysters. Poke was also delicious, but mussels didn't taste very fresh (and my friends disagreed with me on the oysters and thought that was subpar). As for the clam house made chowder, it was solid in all aspects.As for the entrees, I can only speak about  the Boathouse seafood pasta and say that it's one of the most popular entrees for a reason. First of all, the garlic bread that comes with the entrees is actually amazing... so freaking flavorful and the perfect crispy yet soft texture. The pasta itself was so flavor-packed as well, a very unique sauce with penne pasta. But I loved how they really were generous with seafood, unlike a lot of other restaurants. It had some sort of white fish, salmon, small and large scallops, shrimp, etc. and I couldn't even finish because I was so full.And of course, the view is spectacular -- the walls of the restaurant interior are windows so you can see the ocean. And while you wait, you can chill on the beach since the restaurant is right on it! Parking lot is decently big but there are so many people, so you often have to wait for someone to leave.",5 star rating,Iris F.

I knew a lot of places were gonna be closed soon after so I had to check this place out! We ended up there for an early dinner probably around 5ish but closer to 6. Thankfully we were promptly seated (we chose to sit outside and had a cool ocean/beach view). That being said this restaurant is literally on the beach which is pretty nice. I ordered:* seafood pasta - boy this was delicious, this came with a creamy tomato vodka sauce which was slightly spicy and just delicious. The dish also came with LOTS of seafood which I was really impressed by. I would highly recommend this dish!* vanilla creme brûlée - can you ever really go wrong with this?

We ordered California omelette and crab benedict. The portions were quite big.  Parking may get crowded as this is a popular surf spot in Santa Barbara town.

6/4/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I was recommended to try this restaurant if I go to Santa Barbara and was NOT disappointed ! I ordered the lobster and truffle Mac & cheese ($18.95) because it stated to be one of the most popular menu items.It's listed as a starter but I got it as my meal.Ingredients: cavatappi pasta, lobster, black truffle, gruyere cheese, fresh cream, leeks, shallots & herbed breadcrumbs.The first bite had me mind BLOWN !!!As I dipped my fork in and pulled away-- the cheesiness that you see and then all of the different flavors that start to burst in your mouth as you chew and your mind tries to process -- oh my goodness.I was in heaven for a while. The portion (especially the lobster) was pretty generous. It was soooo creamy.Hands down the best Mac & cheese I've ever had. If I knew it'd be this good -- I would've ordered 10 to go and froze it or something.I had a little bit leftover and ate it the next day and it tasted even better !!This restaurant is about 1.5-2 hrs away from me but honestly -- I've considered taking a trip to get more.Hopefully I'm not hyping it up too much.

Calamari though, hands down was the best 100%! It was very soft/tender, super easy to bite down.. Came with delicious chili Pods and grilled onions. Wow. Orange Juice was freshly squeezed, definitely hit the spot. Hopefully once this Covid winter lockdown gets lifted, we can hope to dine and enjoy the nice beach breezy vibes.

Right on what feels like a secluded beach in Santa Barbara. The view alone is worth going for!But now- lets get to the food. I'm reviewing some of the apps I had:- Steamed Manila Clams ($14.95, $8.95 during HH)- Heaven!!! I love seafood but I wouldn't call myself a clam person. These are heavenly. The wine sauce is to die for! We asked for extra bread because it was so good.-Lobster & Truffle Mac N Cheese ($16.95, $11.95 during HH)- okay, by the title alone you know it's going to be good. It was cooked to perfection. Nice big lobster chunks in it too! -Baja Style Fish Tacos ($8.95 during HH) also very good! The fish quality is amazing. We got ours blackened. Overall- great place, great good, great service. That's a five star rating from me!

Unfortunately, the speed might have impacted the quality because everything was pretty disappointing. The Bloody Mary (most popular according to the menu) was extremely watery and tasted more like tomato soup than a Bloody Mary. The shrimp garnish was also bizarre - like a shrimp cocktail without the cocktail. I ordered the Cobb salad and the other girls I was with ordered a few other items and they were all sort of poorly thrown together in a to go box.

My cioppino though, was DELICIOUS, the flavor profile was complex and perfect served with the garlic bread on the side. I had the mule, which was recommended by our server and loved it.

9/23/2019,"Clarksville, MD","Came here for brunch and I could not have been more satisfied. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and the beach views. They had a glass pane that protected from any wind or sand that could have blown in from the beach. The server was well versed on the menu and was friendly. He gave his recommendations for the Boathouse Signature Breakfast, which I was hesitant to order because I'm from Maryland HOME of the Maryland blue crabs. Why order crab cakes anywhere else? This place slapped that notion away with snow and rock crab cakes that had a unique taste from the crab cakes I love from home. While we waited for our food, we enjoyed the views of the ocean, beach goers, and surfers. There was even someone playing guitar and singing on the beach so it was incredibly relaxing. The poached egg was not very runny and had more of a soft yolk texture, which I think was smart since the crab cakes were already very creamy from the nice chipotle hollandaise sauce on top. The crab cakes were savory and just the right amount of salty. The salsa had a nice heat that was mellowed by the slices avocado. There was nothing that could be done to it to make it better. I was incredibly satisfied and very full. I highly recommend this place. Hands down - make the drive out here and enjoy great food and views.",5 star rating,Linda Y.
5/8/2021,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA","After driving for 6 hours we decided to stop for dinner with a local friend  in Santa Barbara. Having been to the boathouse before we thought it would be a great place since we could walk our buddy Samy leashfree on the beach  prior to dinner and just have a relaxing dinner before hitting the road to LA. We called and were told there were no reservations but it wasn't too busy at that time (6pm).  Arriving 10 minutes later we were told it was a 20 minute wait for indoors and less for outdoors. It being overcast and the extra time  for a dogwalk prompted us to chose inside. 20 minutes later, we arrived and were told it would be a just a bit longer. We waited while multiple groups were seated outside. At no time were we asked if the wait was going to be  extended, would we like a outside table? Finally at 7:30pm we were seated!! The food was not bad, Cioppino a bit too spicy, the dried out crab leg did not add any glamor to the dish, fish an chips were average, and ceaser salad average. Service was good but needless to say after waiting 1.5 hrs this place would have had to excell to remediate our delayed return trip. It did not!!  I would recommended The boathouse as a very casual average beachy cafe. It would help to have front of house staff trained not to tell people the wait is 20 minutes when it is actually 90 minutes!",3 star rating,Rita H.

2/14/2021,"La Verne, CA","First time eating at this place. The overall scenery is beautiful. Definitely a nice place to eat and enjoy the view on Valentines Day. Unfortunately for my husband and I, everything else was a huge disappointment. In the famous words of Ricky Bobby, ""if you're not first, your last"".. well at this place, if you're FIRST, you're LAST! We arrived there at 6:45am, walked around the beach, then stood in line at 7:15 thinking the place opened at 7:30(per Yelp), it didn't, they open at 8:00am on a Sunday. We did that so we could be the first in line because Yelp said its difficult to get a seat if you're not there early. We were the first ones in line to be seated, and the LAST to get served. There was a couple that was at the end of the line that got seated and almost finished their entire meal before we even got offered coffee! When the waitress finally got to us I expressed my disappointment, the waitress looked like she could care less! She never even apologized for serving us after literally serving EVERYONE else on the patio! To top things off, when the food arrived, I started eating it only to find a hair in it(no not a joke, seriously! there was hair in it!).. The overall experience of this place was a waste, other than the beach view. We will DEFINITELY not be returning to the Boathouse! On a side note, they were nice enough not to charge us for her hairy plate of food! Thanks Boathouse!",2 star rating,Jessica W.
2/6/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Food AND SERVICE are pinnacles of what makes an amazing restaurant.This place has poor service! Poor management! They take your order, bring your food and that's it. Then, you have to flag people down! The wait to get a table is terrible at best because they tell you you wait 2 hours then you head to the counter and they say it's possibly an additional 30min...and that's a maybe!  Be prepared to wait 2-3hours to get seated...then wait even more to order your food.The food is NOT exceptional at all. It's mediocre seafood...American style. If you want good food, this isn't the place to go! The only thing going for this place is the the view. Luckily, this is SB...there are lots of amazing views and one doesn't have to be subjected to this restaurant!People...please stop putting up with BS!...with your food and with your time!

8/30/2019,"Monterey Park, CA","Lovely restaurant right by a dog beach! Brunch with a view is always a win. Patio seating can be difficult to come by, but the high tops are first-come first- served, so if your party is 4 people or less you can snatch one up. Lucky for us, we got a spot right when we got there at 9:30am in a Tuesday. Their Bloody Mary was packed with flavors and different toppings. It was very heavy, almost a meal in itself. But definitely fun to try! I had their boathouse signature breakfast which was delicious!! The crab cakes were well breaded and there were lots of crab meat inside. It paired very well with the hollandaise sauce and runny poached egg. The country potatoes were pretty good. My bf got the corned beef hash and thought it was okay. Not your typical corned beef hash, these were chunks of beef stirred up with the country potatoes. I can see this place getting very packed, which may change the atmosphere. Indoor seating is also available. I'm interested to try their dinner menu next time, perhaps during sunset?",4 star rating,Cindy H.

The piña colada drink is rly good (I think it's called their punch?) and when we got seated we ordered the lobster mac n cheese and grilled tofu with mango sticky rice and coconut curry (mom's vegetarian). The lobster Mac and cheese was truly amazing, so much lobster and truffle flavor. The view was amazing especially at that time (we tried going for sunset night before and it was too cloudy to see). The waitress put in the wrong order for us so she waived the tofu and gave us fries while waiting, so they have great service as well!!",4 star rating,Megan H.

I just wanted to enjoy a cocktail by the beach and get my daughter a snack before we walked our dog on the beach. I don't think I'd come back here mostly because of the service.

2/19/2020,"Orange County, CA","Visitors to the Boathouse at Hendry's Beach will experience a very impressive one-two punch - the restaurant venue is nothing short of spectacular AND they serve a truly sensational breakfast!  Located right on Hendry's Beach, the views from both the outside and inside tables will ensure a delightful dining experience - as long as you're not a dog owner...Unfortunately, there's a down-side to this very lovely venue; while the beach proper is a full-blown, off-leash dog beach (complete with both showers and a dog wash), the restaurant itself is NOT dog friendly.  Dogs are not allowed in either the restaurant interior or on the patio with the stunning views of the dog beach :-(Tip: Because dogs are NOT allowed in either the restaurant's interior or on the patio, dog lovers should seriously consider leaving their dogs home if they plan to visit this restaurant.  Dog owners with their four-footed friends in tow will be required to leave Fido leashed at the little shaded ""doggie waiting area"" outside the restaurant entrance.Fortunately we set out to dine at the Boathouse during an SB trip when the dogs were off in Orange County visiting with relatives, so we didn't have the dubious pleasure of playing with them on the dog beach only to be asked to tie them up outside.  Knowing now that dogs aren't welcome here, I might bring them to this beach on a future visit, but I wouldn't even consider eating here again when I have my dogs with me.For breakfast, we shared French toast with berries, pancakes with bacon, and salmon with eggs benedict.  All of the food was sensational, which complimented the stunning views very nicely.  We came without a reservation, and opted to wait an extra 15 minutes so that we could sit at a table with an unobstructed view of the beach; the wait was totally worth it!Bottom line: Our dining experience without the fur babies was really exceptional; I'd rate this place five stars without hesitation if they didn't have a ""no dogs allowed"" policy on their patio.  As it is, they'll have to make due with four stars until their policy changes.",4 star rating,Glenn G.

I took a look at the menu beforehand and already knew I was going to order the uni! I was so excited based on the pictures on Yelp. Unfortunately, they ran out of uni! I was soooooo bummed, still bummed.  So...I ordered the New England Style Clam Chowder bowl and it was ehhh, nothing special, too much potatoes. I also ordered calamari for an appetizer, that was pretty good as it came with caramelized onions, green chilies, and an aioli sauce. Yummy. My  husband ordered the lobster roll and was disappointed. It was a lobster salad on a roll. I ordered a Bloody Mary, which was excellent. But, I did find a hair in my a water. Yikes. We learned three things that day, (1) call in advance to ask if they have uni available, (2) do not order the Clam Chowder and (3) do not order the Lobster Roll next time we're here. To sum it all up, average food, average service, nice view, and parking sucks.",3 star rating,Jovete E.

We made our way to the bar.  We ordered 2 mimosas.  The bartender was great!  There was no wait.  Great service.We noticed that the restaurant got very busy.  Their were a lot of people checking in and waiting for a table.  We also noticed the hostess in the phone non-stop.  Our buzzer started going off about 45 minutes into our wait time.  They offer us a high top table behind the hostess station and we took it.  Our server came to our table and let us know that had a QR code for our cell phone to look up the menu.  It was very easy and safe during the pandemic.  The seating was spaced out. 6 feet apart and all staff wore face mask.To my delight they have a Benedict's section!  I ordered the California Benedict with potatoes and added bacon. The eggs were perfectly poached and the bacon they used was delicious.  My husband ordered the house cured salmon Benedict and an order of pancakes .  He said his food was ""magical""!   His pancakes were served with fruit (strawberries and bananas) on top and in between.  He loved everything.As we finished our meal we noticed how busy the hostess still were.  We were impressed at how nice and patient the staff was.  Some of the guest were very rude and not patient.  This is a very popular spot for brunch so again I recommend you come early and enjoy a drink from the bar while you wait.We will be back to this awesome spot on our next trip to Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Diana B.

9/11/2020,"Lompoc, CA","I have to say I was disappointed in the food here. After reading the amazing reviews I was expecting to be blown away by the chowder, seafood pasta, steamed clams and lobster mac n cheese. The service was fine, food came out quick and hot, we only had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table. But unfortunately, the food left is hanging. The most disappointing part at it was the chemical taste that was left in my mouth for about three hours after we left. Portion sizes were awesome we had left overs, but I have to say the seafood was not the freshest I've ever had and the flavors were not what I expected. The strange clams came with a wine garlic broth which usually my husband and I fight over, we each dipped our bread once and that was it. Tasted like muddy water and on top of it I about broke three teeth with five different pieces of shells... we have had countless servings of steamed clams and never have had that happen before, in the bottom of the bowl of course that's obvious but to have pieces in with the meat so when you take a bite its shell with a side of clam. The clams in the clam chowder were good and tender, but the overall flavor of the chowder was almost a burnt or bitter flavor. I am truly sorry maybewe had too high of expectations for the place, but we were let down either way... I'd like to say we will be back, but I can't make any promises. My husband was especially upset about the broken shells in the clams. Hope others enjoy their food better than we did. The view and service is amazing",3 star rating,Sarrah J.

3/2/2020,"Los Gatos, CA","Generally I love this place. Great location, right there at the beach. Friendly staff, good food and reasonably priced. I still recognized a few familiar faces of the staff that have been there since my first visit in 2015.  I visit SB at least 4x a year and each visit I try to hit it up at least once. However, the only disappointment is the service, every time. It takes forever to get the waiter's attention, then ordering and waiting for drinks, appetizers and the main meal. Before our server acknowledge us, and we were clearly ready, he serviced the people on either side of us first and they sat down after us. From when we sat down, finally got the attention of the waiter, got our drinks and appetizer, an hour had gone by when we had finally gotten our main meal. Maybe they are just not equipped to handle a busy full house. Maybe they hire more waiters, waitresses. A little frustrated with the long waiting for everything. Should have known it was gonna be a long night when one person at the entrance asked if she could help me...while she (with another) was already helping us. The other girl had to step in and explain what was going and I was the one they were already helping, looking at the table map deciding where to put us. We walked in they both looked at us, greeted us, I told them my name, reservation for 2 @ 6:30. How could she not know she was already helping me? I think I need a break from the lacking  service for a while, finding another place to eat in the meantime. I may be back after a while.Oh, I had ordered the seafood pasta. The sauce was suppose to be creamy. It was more like watered down. Hardly on the pasta, a ton at the bottom of the bowl. Other than the service issue, it's a great place.

I came here on a Friday night with 3 friends and we waited 2 hours before we got seated. The food was pretty good, although I think the sizes of the individual pieces of seafood were on the smaller side (small clams, small oysters, etc). We ordered the small $45 seafood platter, and it was honestly not worth because of the sizes of the seafood. However, it was different for the main dishes, and I felt the portions were pretty generous for those. I got the Cioppino, and I loved that the soup was on the creamier side and not just a liquid-y tomato soup. There was pretty much every kind of seafood you could imagine in it, and it was all fresh and delicious. My friends got various pasta dishes, and they were also very impressed. We all had leftovers to take home. Probably wouldn't get the seafood platter ever again, but for the main dishes, I would definitely come back! The location is also extremely beautiful.

If you love seafood and crab cakes this is the place. For vegetarians, there are really one or two options to choose from. We ordered crab cakes - which were just perfect & filling and Thai rice plate with veggies - which I would say was okay, did not had much flavour to it though.

They have a large outdoor patio that's primarily covered with a multitude of large umbrellas coupled with heaters so the temp was well under control. Inside the restaurant there are beautiful large paned windows covering almost the entire wall facing the ocean giving an entirely unobstructed view out onto the beach.Our food was good - not particularly WOW but wasn't disappointed either.

I ordered the Caesar salad which had a nice anchovy flavor without being overpowering; you could still taste the lemon, pepper, Parmesan, and it was slightly creamy, very delicious. I think the coolest thing about this entire menu is the fact they have a fairly large list of protein *sides* -- so if you order something fairly simply, like a Caesar salad, you can tailor it to your liking. I added a salmon filet on top, which was cooked PERFECTLY. Flaky, moist, incredible flavor. Great place!",5 star rating,Triana G.

We also got super lucky with parking and was able to park in the lot right by it. The restaurant is also by the entrance to the dog beach so it was busy with folks walking their dogs as well. We asked the hostess if we could sit outside with a table facing the beach. She let us know she could sit us right away inside or wait a few more minutes for a table facing the beach. We chose to wait as it was his birthday weekend and I wanted him to have a view. It wasn't long before our beeper notified us that our table was ready. I started off breakfast with a Bloody Mary which was sooo yummy. I wished the bacon and shrimp skewer never ended. I ordered the boathouse signature that came with a tasty chipotle hollandaise sauce with a poached egg on top of a crab cake. Overall, great service and food.

7/28/2019,"Houston, TX","This restaurant was amazing. The first thing you see is the beach, which allows dogs! There are tons of dogs on the beach as the restaurant is almost on the sand. They have indoor and outdoor seating.The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. I ordered the boathouse omelette and a bit chocolate while my girlfriend ordered the granola and a latte. We both really enjoyed our drinks, which were the perfect temperature and tasted amazing. My girlfriend also enjoyed her granola as she said it was a good ratio of yogurt, granola, and fruit. My omelette was amazing. It had a nice amount of lobster and shrimp with spinach spread throughout. The cheese was layered well throughout making for an omelette with amazing ingredients that I could taste in each bite. It also came with the breakfast potatoes and i chose the housemade biscuit as my bread option. Both the potatoes and biscuit tasted amazing.Would highly recommend this restaurant as it had a great staff, nice location, and amazing food.",5 star rating,Christopher Z.

9/6/2020,"Bakersfield, CA","The location is  unbeatable. It's like having a beautiful private beach to stroll around on while you wait on the table or after your meal to digest some amazing sea food...The food was delicious...Lobster Mac and Cheese, you have to try!Ciopino was on point and delicious...They have a wide range of cocktails, all really good. Overall, if you are in Santa Barbara, strongly recommend. It is slightly more upscale compared to Brophy's but still with a chill vibe.",4 star rating,Rahul S.
4/12/2021,"Alhambra, CA","This was a great way to end our SB getaway. The wait is substantial on the weekend but as long as you are not starving it will be easy to entertain yourselves. A nice long walk on the beach will take up as much time as needed. If you are not a big dog lover (it's a dog beach) then grab a drink at the bar and relax outside on the picnic tables, benches, or raised bed edges. The food was tasty and service good, the view was excellent.",5 star rating,Kristin A.

1/20/2020,"San Jose, CA",We came here as a group of 3 and took us good 35 mins to get a table outside. IMO it was worth the wait to be seated outside next to the ocean. We were visiting for the weekend and found this place to be a great spot for brunch by the ocean and i couldn't agree more. I got their smoked salmon Benedict and it was just delicious. Also got their fresh OJ which was good too. Recommending to anyone in the area for a nice brunch experience by the ocean.,5 star rating,Arpita S.
5/30/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Not my fave seafood ever but you will find me here at least once a month enjoying the atmosphere. Why? 2 words: HAPPY HOUROh and there 3 more... Location, location, location!You can not beat the happy hour menu- there are just about a thousand combinations for a happy beachside buzz and full tummy all for under $20 bucks! Personally, as a local here in SB, I would not come here if either of those two components didn't exist. Without the discount during happy hour the food is pricey- but still worth it if you are able to catch the unbeatable sunset over Hendry's after a clear day in SB. A star removed because of the high tourist situation and another half-star off because if you come here- and do happy hour right then you can't really go anywhere else. The place is pretty isolated and if you drink- you will have to deal with leaving your car on the beach. The other half star off is because the menu is pretty ordinary. I mean, they don't really need to be creative, given their location but more chef centered menu with seasonal offerings would be good for people like me- who might opt to bring in an out of town guest if I knew the food would wow them!Yes, it's a tourists trap. No, not all the seafood is locally sourced.Yes, I still recommend this place- knowing I've had better seafood within a 10-mile range.",3 star rating,Vanessa R.
9/16/2020,"CA, CA",The view is FANTASTIC especially around the sunset time. And the staffs overall were nice and very helpful. We definitely enjoyed our dinner here. It was the perfect place for our time here. Mahi mahi salad: my friend ordered was tasty which I tried. Good amount of fish.Ahi tuna: the tuna steak was cooked perfectly.

5/21/2019,"Alhambra, CA","On our way to Pismo Beach, the hubby and I stopped by for a quick lunch and I must say, what started as a pit stop turned out to be a well spent afternoon. Wait time for the table was about 10 mins, we arrived RIGHT at lunch time, but we were seated within 5 mins. The view is breath taking, feel so good and relaxing to have while enjoying some super fresh oysters. The hubby and I got a half a dozen to share, fish and chips and clam chowder soup. All of the items tasted amazingly fresh. Customer service was very good as well, we were taken care from the moment we were seated, drinks and water were refilled right away, we were checked in with a few times.A few pet peeves I had was that our table was a bit too small, once all the items arrived, we barely had enough space and that our tables were spaced TOO close to the one next to us. Not only you can hear another parties' convo but when you get up to leave, if you got a bit of junk in your trunk, you will graze other peoples' tables. Other then that, my entire experiences here has been amazing, I look forward to coming back, I have already recommend this place to some family and friends.Parking - there is a lot, freePrice - reasonable",5 star rating,Laura T.
9/15/2020,"Woodland Hills, CA","I'm not going to lie, I am reluctant to write a review for this place. Sometimes its best to keep some secret spots to yourself but that would be selfish of me. So its pretty simple this location is wonderful. The parking can be a challenge of course for good reason, the location is just so Cool! The restaurant has a full bar and great food right on the Beach. I'd have to say the only problem in this Coastline stretch of beaches in Santa Barbara is the fact that your feet may be covered in Tar. Otherwise its just Amazing!

5/31/2019,"Goleta, CA","With all the hype about Boathouse, I was excited to come here with a friend for brunch. However, we were extremely let down by our experience here. Service was brusque at best (and pretty far from the friendly service described in other reviews). We sat at one of the high tops, but because of the sun, we didn't really get to enjoy the view from patio, as it was around noon (we turned around to face the entrance so we didn't have the sun in our face for the entire meal). My friend and I both got the Boathouse Signature Breakfast. I got mine with the eggs scrambled, and she got hers with poached eggs. The food wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say that it was particularly good either, and certainly not worth the price or the wait.It's unlikely that I'd come back, especially since it's pretty far out of the way.",2 star rating,Irene C.

Our plate came and the were food marks everywhere.m, and made me think of it was washed well. My order was fish taco with the side of Spanish rice mixed black beans and corn. The side was too small, it was most likely two table spoons. The fish tacos were tasteless. I noticed that staff were sanitizing tables between guests to give them credit but very sloppy considering COVID. When we arrived there were wet marks of glasses all over our table and we had to ask to be cleaned.",3 star rating,Tammy m.
4/15/2021,"Arcadia, CA",Service was lame. I'm severely allergic to sesame and there were sesame seeds in the ceviche tostada and it didn't say it on the menu. I told the server and he brought me the dish again and it still had sesame seeds. At this point everyone had finished their meals and I decided to order a salad. We were a large party and ordered a good amount of food and when I asked the server to comp the salad because it wasn't even what I wanted to order and they only comped 50% of it so $8 off. Server wasn't even apologetic. Sad.,1 star rating,Emi P.
8/2/2020,"Las Vegas, NV",Excellent location right next to the beaches of Santa Barbara. Beautiful presentation and delicious cocktails. A bit overpriced but I'm sure it's because of the location. Had a nice lunch with the soothing sound of the waves was perfection.,4 star rating,Marie F.

We have a dog, so we just put our name on the list, and they gave us a buzzer, and then we walked down the beach with the pup for 45 minutes while we waited for our buzzer to go off. It ended up being perfect. Our server was very sweet and attentive, we sat right out side looking at the ocean. The food was SO GOOD. Usually these really well liked places are just because they have good views but this place has the great food to go with it!! I got the Boathouse Breakfast (I think that's what it was called) Crab cakes with poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise sauce?!? 10/10 high recommend!

7/13/2019,"San Diego, CA","So this weekend we decided to explore the beautiful Santa Barbara and paid a visit to this somewhat hidden gem. This beach side restaurant is what you'd love to have for a perfect summer day. Something very unique about this restaurant; it sits on a dog beach. At the entrance of the parking lot entrance is an actual doggie wash lol. It doesn't stop there! Right outside the restaurant is a covered ""stable"" where you can keep your dogs while you enjoy a quick bite. The food itself is delicious!! Interesting enough, I am personally not a seafood kind of person, so I ordered the steak. Belly stacking good, lemme tell you. My brother ordered their burger and my mom got their signature seafood pasta. The service was amazing! Our waitress, Danielle was super helpful, kept us on her radar and was super nice and sweet.If you're ever in the Santa Barbara area, I definitely recommend this place. There's outdoor and indoor seating, heaters, umbrellas and glass walls so you're never separated from the beautiful ocean!!!",5 star rating,Raven S.

They gave us a pager so we just took a stroll at the beach while waiting. They said it was a 45 minute wait , but we were called in 15 minutes. We wouldn't have minded waiting longer cause the view was absolutely beautiful with the sun setting :) we were seated outside next to the fire place which was nice ! They have heaters as well.  I got the seafood pasta which is now one of my most favorite food ! It's soooo good !

My younger sister recommended that we give this place a try, and I'm glad we ended our last night in Santa Barbara at a great dining experience with Boathouse! We waited around 30 minutes for outdoor seating, it's buuuusy on a Thursday evening right before sunset. We didn't mind the wait because they have the clicker to buzz you when a table is ready and plus, the beach is right there. Our server was conversational, and fuuun! Ok, now the real deal -  Our selection: kush raw oysters (he explained that they were not the sweet ones, at market price), lobster mac and cheese (appetizer), boathouse seafood pasta, and spice rubbed grilled sea bass (maincourses) = totals to be $100 for 3 peopleOur favorite was the seafood pasta with the perfect flavors coming from the seafood, marinara sauce, and parmesan! - GET this, super worth! Try their other main courses - we liked the seabass as well! For the lobster mac and cheese, we were most excited about this one; however, it was a tad salty - so unfortunately, it was a no go for us. We will definitely make a second visit the sista graduates!",5 star rating,Jen V.

I don't think you can go wrong with this menu! Well, almost. We got the shrimp cocktail and the calamari. Some of the best calamari we've ever had! The lobster special--amazing. Steak was delicious, salmon was so good! Best cook on a salmon I've ever had. The spicy pasta was a bit disappointing. It was not spicy at all, and could have used some salt. The seafood in it was great, though. The creme brulee was good but not the best. All that being said, we would come back in a heartbeat! Excellent evening spent here.",5 star rating,Heather S.

The location is unbeatable and we lucked out and were able to be seated right away on a Friday around 12 noon. The place was packed! We didn't get a table by the water, but the location and ambience is so nice it doesn't really matter. What REALLY MATTERS is that they have Clam Chowder Fries (with Bacon!). These were sooooo delicious but way too much for two people to finish. Doesn't matter, I would order these again in a heartbeat. I had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. My hubby ordered the corned beef hash and he said it was just okay, didn't have a lot of flavor. Overall we loved our lunch here and would come again- it's so fun strolling along the beach afterwards. Parking can be tricky when it gets busy, but at least it's free.",4 star rating,Adriana R.

11/8/2020,"Santa Cruz, CA","This place has what it takes to be exceptional but is really just okay. The location is great and the food was pretty good however, our experience was not great. We went on today on a Sunday at 10 so as to be expected the wait was long (1-1.5 hours), so when our name was finally the next up after over 1.5 hours the hostess asked if we wanted to ""skip the line"" and get seated at a bar stool high top in the middle of the doorway next to the bar. We asked if we could wait instead and have a table since we were next up on the list. The lead hostess rolled her eyes and turned to the other group of people in line and said in front of us ""people have been so rude to me and yelling at me all day long"". It was just blatantly rude especially since we had not complained about waiting and had just said no to her offer of bar stool table. Next, at the table, our server was okay, he took our order however, after 45 mins of our food not showing up, he came to the table and said that the ticket had been lost and they are making it now and it will be ready in 2 minutes. Not his fault but still, this place lacks the kind of service that would make it exceptional. Overall, this place has a lot of potential, good location and pretty good brunch food...but I would avoid it if you want to have an easy/pleasant brunch experience. There are so many other options in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Sarah B.

The crab was tasteless for some reason. However I did request extra crab and did receive a lot. Found a hair in it unfortunately. By then, I had eaten quite a bit. Tossed the rest. Hubby ordered a tuna melt. He said it was ok. I also ordered a key lime pie. Which is to die for. But it was a very tiny slice for $12.

We were lucky to get a table by the window facing the beach and it was just perfect! Probably one of the best views I've had with a meal (see pics)! I ordered the smoked salmon benedict which was a classic. He ordered the pork belly benedict which was a low-carb option consisting of perfectly poached eggs over thick slices of pork belly. Let's just say it was so delicious I ended up eating most of his plate! Our Nat light drinks were a great compliment to the food. While we were there we saw plenty of larger groups there and the staff was extremely accommodating, putting tables together for them and moving heaters around. It seems like it would be the perfect place for a nice family gathering or girly brunch! Another plus is the huge free parking lot that they have adjacent to the restaurant that is shared with the public beach. Highly recommended!",5 star rating,Katherine W.

6/22/2019,"Huntington Beach, CA",This restaurant has a killer view and a nice ambiance in their outdoor seating area. The weather was nice today so the restaurant was pretty crowded. The wait was around 10 min. We tried making a reservation but they don't take reservations. Also there's a lot of cute dogs outside.I had the salmon plate & they didn't have bagels so I had to get bread. I requested sourdough but they didn't have that either. The waiter started saying some fancy breads that sounded kinda gross like rye and whole grain but I just asked for white bread. The salmon tasted super fishy but the tomato and onion that was served with it kinda masked the taste. I tried making a sandwich with the bread but it's just not the same without a bagel. Their cream cheese was pretty fire though because they added dill in it. Their steamed clams had were straight fire and the liquid it was sauced in tasted very winey. I didn't think the food was super special or anything but I'd be willing to come back to try some stuff on their lunch menu!,4 star rating,Brianna S.
4/25/2019,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",Hendry's is everything you want in a beach cafe: An open space with a big patio and well-stocked bar right on the beach. Great seafood too! The bar is fantastic.

Decent fries and slaw. Nothing more, nothing less. $14.95 Steamed Manila Clams - white wine, garlic, thyme, mesquite grilled garlic bread:Very good!

8/7/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","This is a very hard rating decision because I'm debating between Horrible Customer service and Great Food. 3 girls at the door, they should be working somewhere else, they don't even do a proper greeting, they just look so busy and like they can't handle the rush hour, I asked for a menu and they told me just to scan the QR code which by the way it's impossible to check on line because the signal here was gone and they don't have wi-fi.I asked for jam with my to go order and tge girl told me ""what do you need jam for? "" and that is really my business you just have to sell it.So dissapointed  for this, I was looking forward to celebrate my birthday here with a brunch but I because of this I just ordered some food to go.On the other hand the food is amazingly good, so if you train better your team for customer service it'll be 5 stars for sure.",2 star rating,Fabiola M.

Okay moving on. On some nights, the wait can be a little long but sitting by the beach and taking pictures always makes the time pass faster. We were seated in the outdoor side which had a great ocean view!I ordered the Pan Seared Chicken Breast which is one of four non fish options and....it was BOMB.

11/26/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","We booked a Sunday brunch reservation with Boathouse for a Bach weekend I was throwing a good friend of mine. I called and let them know it was a special occasion and that I wanted to make the meal very special for the bride. After being told this place doesn't take reservations on the weekends I was disappointed but willing to still make it to Boathouse and wait for such a great place. Checked their site and left an email on their inquiry page requesting for the reservation for our large group and hoped that they would make an exception. Sure enough they emailed me and called me back. They let me know they were going to be able to set the reservation but not only that, they also offered us a table VIP bottle service at their local club spot Indocine for the night before our reservation. This was such a great surprise and delight! Of course we took them up on their offer and changed our night plans to make sure to stop in for the table service. I loved that they offered such a special just because we were dining with them and celebrating such an occasion. Goes to show... you should always tell people if youre celebrating a special occasion. The club was locally known as a not so upscale place and definitely didn't have the reputation my friend would want to go to - solely because she's a more wholesome gal.... and yet Boathouse exceeded our expectations again! The club played a great mix of hip hop and old 90 classic songs that made us feel very young again and overall had a great time. When we arrived the next day for our Brunch reservation... the one thing we didn't plan for was parking. I'd recommend you drop your party off before parking as the overfill lots were a very far walk. Prepare for not a huge lot but know they have two lots and looked like there was more parking when we left at 1:30PM. Our table was already ready by the time we arrived at 11:30AM and the hostess was able to walk us back immediately. Our table was the best table in the whole restaurant :) Front corner table on their patio facing the water shore. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to our great weekend in SB. This was definitely the cherry on the top. Evan was our server - who was amazing!!! So attentive, helpful, suggestive, and we never had empty water glasses which is huge for me. I drink a lot of water and love it when the staff can be on top of their game with the refills. Food was awesome. We had all the specials... lobster mac and cheese, chowder fries, and special lobster salad. No one left that place hungry or unsatisfied. Couldn't believe how fresh the seafood was. I ordered the poke and was thoroughly impressed. I'd definitely order the Calamari, Burger, Cornbeef Hash, and Crab Cakes.. which the other girls ordered and loved. If you're looking for a friendly staff, a great view, and delicious lunch and brunch options in SB - you MUST stop at Boathouse. I'll be back and will be bringing friends and family so they too can see what this place has to offer....which is more than just their food.",5 star rating,Rochell D.
11/24/2019,"San Marcos, CA",So glad I chose this place for bday anniversary dinner. I made reservation for 10 people and We got seated right away though we were there 15 minutes before. Our server Caitlyn made our experience spectacular. She's very accommodating and we love her! Wish we were there when the sun is still up so we can have a good view of the ocean but the breeze and sound of the waves compensated for it. We also loved  the food and the price isn't that bad. I was expecting to pay more  for this kind of place. Yes I will recommend!,5 star rating,Marie P.

9/18/2019,"San Diego, CA","After recommendations from two people in my life that are very familiar with Santa Barbara, my boyfriend and I decided to try Boathouse at Hendry's for Saturday brunch. After spending the majority of our weekend in the Funk Zone are of downtown Santa Barbara, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Boathouse was situated in a beach alcove surrounded by beautiful green mountains. It reminded me so much of Hawaii and I couldn't be any happier when I realized the paralleling beach was actually a dog beach! There is a decent sized parking lot, but as it was a Saturday and the parking lot hosts both beach goers and restaurant patrons, we circled a few times. We got very lucky and scored a front row spot, but I can see this being a normal problem during the summer months, so I'd definitely give myself a few extra minutes to include if I were on a schedule. We had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated, but it was no issue as we greatly enjoyed sitting on a bench watching the waves while we waited. I opted to try the Huevos Hope Ranch: over easy eggs between crispy corn tortillas. Topped with ranchero sauce, avocado, sour cream and queso fresco. Served with black beans and breakfast potatoes. Huevos Rancheros are always hit and miss with me as I find oftentimes the tortillas at the bottom of the dish are very soggy by the time I get to them and soggy tortillas are no Bueno. Boathouse did a great job with crisping the tortillas beforehand though because it seemed to help them from getting to mushy and there was a perfect crunch in every bite. The dish was overall very flavorful and I was happy with my choice. I also decided to try the Banana Bread, a drink from their seasonal menu. It included Plantation 5 star rum, banana liquer, lime, and cinnamon honey syrup. I absolutely adore all things banana flavored, which I think are greatly underappreciated and can be quite tough to find, especially in cocktail form. I was thrilled to see this drink on the menu and was even more excited when our waitress warned me that it was very sweet. I have quite the sweet tooth, so bring on the sweetness I say! This drink was absolutely delicious, albeit strong. As tasty as banana is, it does not mask alcohol flavors well, but luckily I like the flavor of Rum. It was the perfect brunch buzz to start off our day touristing. Boathouse is a perfect place for a date, brunch with girlfriends, or to come with or as out of town guests.",5 star rating,LeeAnn B.

My partner ordered the chilaquiles and I ordered the signature dish with crab cakes, poached eggs and a chipotle hollandaise sauce. It was PERFECT. Well salted, well balanced, came out super quick and with a beach view, we couldn't ask for more. Highly recommend.",5 star rating,Andrew L.
10/5/2019,"Campbell, CA","We came here on a weekday for breakfast/brunch.  We had been to SB so many times and never been to this place.  It was such a great place.  The ambiance is great, it's right on the beach...The views are amazing.  The weather was perfect in September.  We had French toast, omlette and mimosas! The service was great and the waiters were very attentive.  The plates are very big but we were very hungry so we finished them all.  It's a nice place to chill and relax and listen to the ocean.  I'm sure the wait on the weekend to get seated is much longer and the parking may be harder to fine but since we went on a weekday, we did not encounter any issues.",5 star rating,Yasmin A.

12/26/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Beautiful location while visiting Santa Barbara for a week, we frequented the boathouse for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The view was beautiful. Oceanside & locals take their pets for a walk on the beach. Dinner was wonderful. We had the mussels and oysters. The kusshi oysters were our favorite. We also had the cioppino which was very savory. We finished with the creme brûlée. For lunch we had the ceviche and shrimp cocktail. Both were delectable. The burger was also good. We ended lunch with the mud cake. Really an amazing dessert. Breakfast was not as satisfactory as lunch and dinner. The salmon Benedict was very delicious. The hollandaise sauce is perfectly made. We had a couple or Bellini's with fresh cranberries, they were delicious and refreshing.  The pancakes however were subpar. They were very dry. We had maybe two bites and were unable to finish. I've had much better pancakes elsewhere. Overall, we enjoyed our experiences at the boat house. The preparation of the pancakes definitely needs revision. The seafood however is amazing. The creme brûlée and mud cake are a perfect finish to lunch or dinner.",4 star rating,Jennifer M.
9/11/2020,"Camarillo, CA","Awful management. The Management here does nothing to prepare the children working here to interact and address people with concerns. Imagine waiting two hours for a table and by that time,  it's cold but it's okay, there's a heat. Well- the staff randomly removes the heater near your table. Also- you're put near the emergency exit in the back. After two hours, you are ready to eat and chill. You let the waitress know you are disappointed with the heater situation and you feel it was rude to remove the heater from your area and you are met with nothing but the attitude of a little girl making ""psh!!!!"" Noises like a kid. No customer service experience. More than likely, a family member of the owners. No other reason to allow that behavior to represent your company. Then you ask for the manager, share your concerns and disappointment and are met with a bunch of head nodding and relocating. By that tome, it's clear no one gives two cents about your experience and you decide to leave. You share with the manager, we are leaving but wanted to let you know about this. I guess when you are brown like my boyfriend, this is what happens. They don't want anyone not white and driving a Benz,  eating here.  Then when you say you are leaving, you are met with another kid of a waiter stomping their feet to mimic you. By now, there is zero chance I would ever come back and don't recommend this place to anyone. Management is absolute disgust and the kids who work there are a true example of snowflake and entitlement. Sucks for them because we tip well. Peace.",1 star rating,Jennifer M.

The lively atmosphere and attentive service made the experience a lot of fun, and one is easily lost in the magical view and sound of waves crashing close by. Back to the food, the salmon and asparagus were perfectly cooked, and I was pleasantly surprised by the lobster mashed potatoes. Usually, I think of mashed potatoes as relatively flavorless and simply not a great way to eat potatoes. I'm not the biggest fan of lobster either. However, the combination at boathouse was delightful.I look forward to coming back for brunch, about which, I've heard great things.",4 star rating,Brian R.

Their bfast is on point, we even tried their clam chowder with bfast, worth it...creamy and loaded with clams! We came on a Saturday morning, a lot of people waiting, but we got seated within ten minutes...most likely because it was only two of us. Don't worry about the wait, you get a lovely view of the beach and plenty of seating area. Anything Benedict here is worth it. Crab Benedict and the pork belly Benedict were some of the best we've ever had! The crab was crunchy, had a light spice and the hollandaise sauce was creamy, perfect amount of bitter and all around rich. The poached egg was perfection as well. The plate doesn't seem all that big but it packs a punch and fills you up, that's for sure! We got the French toast also, paired with the berries it was delish!

2/10/2021,"Isla Vista, CA","Very nice restaurant, we came for a birthday & our female server was extremely kind. Unfortunately, we were very obviously stared at & laughed at by some men that I assume were off-duty employees or regular customers, they eventually blocked us in the walkway and confronted us for giving them odd looks after we came out from the bathroom. It escalated slightly so we left in order to avoid the situation getting out of hand, but about 10 minutes later as we were waiting for an Uber in the roundabout, a female employee came out threatening to call the police on us because we were supposedly ""harassing"" the men yet she & the other employees had legitimately refused to hear our side of what had occured. I never leave reviews but the handling of the situation is the sole reason for the one star review, as we all thought this was completely unnecessary & rude considering we had already left & were trying to get home. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, I know that some things often escalate but I also know that it is always important to be unbiased in those situations, regardless of your relationship with a certain party. It was a very bizarre, biased, & misogynistic considering the fact that most of the employees were so adamant about only considering the men's view of the situation while completely ignoring how we felt about what had occurred simply because we were obviously younger than those men. I have been here before & love the food but I will definitely not be returning after this.",1 star rating,Jasmine K.

4/1/2019,"Chicago, IL","Boathouse is a scenic restaurant that is great for a relaxing brunch, or catching the sunset. Their cocktails are delicious and their bartenders are extremely friendly and attentive. As it specifically relates to the food I would have to say that my experiences have been somewhat inconsistent. For example, on one occasion i ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. When I told my waiter that the eggs on it seemed to be a bit overcooked as the yolk wasn't runny. I was told that the egg was supposed to be that way. On another occasion however the egg was cooked perfectly.Most recently, last week I went and ordered the steak and fries. I asked for the steak to be Medium and was given a steak was was somewhere between medium well and well done. They took the steak back and cooked me another, however this steak was also well done. The manager graciously took the steak off my bill. Today, I requested a medium steak and the steak i received was rare. They did however cook it longer and bring me a very tender steak. But in comparison to last week, this steak was very bland. The plus side however is that they do a great job with seafood!",3 star rating,Josh R.

They give you a beeper and you can go 100 yards away. We just walk on the beach and time flies so fast and the next thing you know, you get buzzed to go back to the host for your table.

1/8/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is my favorite place to bring friends and family when they're in town. It has the perfect backdrop of the beach and the food / drinks aren't bad either.I've been here for brunch and dinner, both are superb. For dinner, the seared ahi tuna is heavenly!! I wish I could eat that every day. For brunch, the staple is The Signature, which is basically a crab cake Benedict with a bomb chipotle aioli sauce. The lobster omelette and pork belly Benedict my friend got also looked really great! Of course the prices reflect the location, but it doesn't break the bank. I'd say you're looking at $15 average a plate for brunch, maybe $25 if you add in those hangover cure Bloody Mary's! Dinner is understandably more expensive, around $25-35/plate, but you must add in a blood orange margarita. :) The only negative thing I could say is that I wish dogs would be allowed on the outdoor patio. They have an area outside the patio where you can leash up your dogs, but it just seems like an inevitable way for some dogs to fight over space.",5 star rating,Rochelle C.

We'd go back in a flash if we were near, but this was a special weekend in Santa Barbara -- far from home.",5 star rating,Brien M.
10/21/2018,"Rosemead, CA","This spot is one of the most beautiful and best places I have ever been to in all of California. The restaurant itself is pretty much the only thing here, right next to a private beach. It is a very secluded area. The view from inside is beautiful as you overlook the ocean. I came here around sunset so I was able to watch the sun slowly setting over the horizon while I waited for my food. We had reservations so there was only a 5 minute wait as they set up our table. My boyfriend and I ordered 3 dishes and each one was fantastic! We got the lobster mac and cheese (delicious and full of lobster meat!), ahi poke (fresh and perfectly seasoned), and the Cioppino (full of seafood in a delicious broth!). The portions were fairly large and more than enough for two people. Oh and I cant forget the meal comes with some delicious bread to open with!The service was amazing too. My water glass was never empty and the wait staff was very attentive. This is a great place for a date. Super romantic at night and after dinner you can take a stroll down the beach and gaze at the stars. There is plenty of parking in the parking lot attached to the beach. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone! I will for sure be back to try their famous brunch and for another delicious and romantic dinner!",5 star rating,Michelle T.

The calamari appetizer was good, but the entrees were just okay. I ordered the grilled mahi mahi with mango sticky rice, coconut curry sauce and pineapple salsa. The fish was overcooked and bland. They needed more sauce, salsa, and salt. My boyfriend got the seabass and it was cooked just right. Overall, just okay.",3 star rating,Jamie C.

My son ordered the creme brûlée and that was wonderful as was my coffee drink.  We will definitely be back!",4 star rating,DeAnna G.

3/7/2020,"San Diego, CA","Had lunch with a family friend in SB here after a grad school visit at UC Santa Barbara. This place is pretty unassuming but their patio has such a beautiful view of the ocean. Plus, Hendry's Beach is dog friendly so you get to see some adorable pups frolic as you eat. Came here on a Tuesday morning for brunch, so parking was pretty easy to find. I enjoyed a smoked salmon benedict and my friend got the Boathouse special, which is benedicts on crab cakes. I was craving lox so this dish hit the spot. While it was nothing groundbreaking, it was a standard fresh, tasty brunch dish. Eating it right on the beach a PLUS...what more could you want? After walking off my meal and playing with some pups, I noticed that they also have a walk up window where you can get some no-frills summer beach staples, like hotdogs, hamburgers, fries, and ice cream. This place is a dream if you love brunch, dogs, and the ocean.",4 star rating,Natalie Z.
1/11/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","My fiancé loves this place (he goes every so often with work colleagues), but I don't get the appeal. The view is phenomenal for sure, but I don't care for the food at all. I was actually shocked how bad the food was considering how highly my fiancé had talked about it (and the only seafood he eats is mahi mahi, so that's not the reason).I don't eat seafood, with the exception of salmon, and I'm allergic to spinach. The salmon dish and every single non-seafood dish except for the tofu dish have spinach. Seeing as how I'm ALLERGIC (technically/medically it's an intolerance, but not worth explaining the difference because the point is I'm not able to eat it or I get horrifically sick) to spinach, I asked if they could substitute the spinach for something else, but the server gave me some excuse as to why they wouldn't. So my only option was to order the grilled tofu with mango sticky rice which actually sounded good even though it picky about tofu. It was downright terrible. I couldn't stomach more than two bites. The server took my plate away knowing I didn't like it without so much as a ""I'm sorry to hear that.""On top of that, they have outdoor deck seating and don't allow dogs in their outdoor area. You have to tie your dog up to a pole at the entrance to the restaurant. It's pretty unbelievable actually, especially since their restaurant is literally located at the entrance to the only dog-friendly beach in Santa Barbara.",2 star rating,Steph P.

Especially since me and my husband were on our honey moon and while visiting arroyo burro beach we decided to go to this cute little restaurant right next to it. We requested a table where you can sit outside and look out at the ocean. We got the lobster Mac and cheese & apple walnut Salad to start. My husband got fish and chips. I got the veggie beyond burger. For desert we got Homemade macadamia nut mud pie. Everything was amazing and eye pleasing. Very presentable. I was very satisfied. Will definitely be coming back!,5 star rating,Tamara N.

The 3 hostess said that it was a mistake and had us sit down again . We waited for a total of an hour and ended up ordering Togo. While waiting for our Togo one of the hostesses walked out and stared me down with a dirty look. We finally got our Togo food and 3 out of 5 meals came out on time and one of my friends order never got taken to kitchen so they had to make her order late and the other plate had a hair in it. It was probably the worst customer service ever! The food was okay not great. So if the food is not up to par they should at least have good customer service.,1 star rating,Kimberly L.

The happy hour is a decent deal and the food while pricey, fresh and made with care.The service I had at this location was top notch, all servers were splendid and seemed to be genuinely happy.I do think the price of seafood platter at 70 dollars was not a great deal, it would have been better to buy smaller entrees from the happy hour instead.The Grilled Wild Scottish Salmon was amazing, it was like butter and the mashed potatoes with lobster were probably the best mashed potatoes I ever had.I definitely recommend this restaurant, any local or tourist needs to try it.",4 star rating,Aowei C.

We didnt have cocktails just ordered the calamari app, seafood pasta, and the sea bass. Everything was cooked perfectly. The calamari was so tender. The seafood pasta with shrimp scallop and fish all perfect, nothing over done. My sea bass was melt in your mouth and only lightly spiced, just right.

Apparently, this gang hits cars here on a daily basis because of its seclusion. WHY IS NO ONE GETTING WARNED?!? Not having armed security here is irresponsible and dangerous. They shoved a screwdriver into my door and forced the locks to open. (Alarm systems are not activated by the type of screwdriver they use, according to the officer.)The food wasn't worth it and the wait was 2 hours long which gave these criminals plenty of time to look through my car.Seriously, Santa Barbara has plenty of beachfront, don't lose the shirt off your back over this place (literally).",1 star rating,Alex G.

6/25/2018,"Orange County, CA","Boathouse really displays the essence of what Santa Barbara is. Forewarning, it might be a mission to find parking but totally worth!! Perfect setting for date night, special occasions, or just simply a treat yo self meal (yasss you totally deserve it). They got views. If you're able to get inside seating, the ocean is right in front of you. Waves crashing. Wine glasses clinking. Fragrant seafood aroma. This is the definition of a perfect summer's day. People wine about how long it takes for food to come out but you have to set the mood with drinks first. Boathouse Punch is a popular choice according to our server. It's their version of a Pina Colada. Fruity and sweet is what you get. For appetizers, we started with the Apple Walnut Salad. They were able to incorporate sweetness from the apple and savoriness from the dressing. Walnuts gave it a nice crunch to every bite. It's quite unique and enjoyable to eat. Ahi Tuna was on par with tastiness. The crispy, wonton crackers not only gave it texture but held everything together to create the perfect bite. It melts in your mouth. Crab cakes came with two pieces. They were pretty standard but good. Oh my word, Seafood pasta lives up to its hype and rightfully belongs in the highlights section. It is lick off your plate good. The sauce is a creamy tomato just like a combination of marinara and alfredo. Seafood tasted close to being fresh out the ocean. We also ordered the mussels and coppino. It's a plate of seafood placed in a pool of diluted tomato sauce. Garlic bread is provided. They use the same exact sauce in both dishes. It is essentially the same thing so you can get one and order something else to add variety to your meal. Dinner was absolutely delectable. It was truly a great experience from start to finish. Awaiting the next time I'm in SB to come again...until then!!",5 star rating,Kim N.

7/3/2019,"Rowland Heights, CA","Gorgeous view since Boathouse at Hendry's Beach is literally on the beach with a nice waitress.Not a lot of parking spots in the summer due to the number of beach goers.Fish is cooked perfectly.  Our table ordered both the Mahi Mahi Salad and the Local Sole fish entrée. Unfortunately, the Sole Fish entrée is super bland (the lemon caper butter marination might as well have been invisible because my taste buds didn't pick it up at all).  The Mahi Mahi salad was of good quality but nothing memorable.If you do choose to eat here, definitely pick their Cioppino (which also happens to be Boathouse at Hendry's Beach's Signature Dish).  Again, the tomato based seafood dish was cooked perfectly and the lightly spicy soupy sauce was thicker than broth which is a bonus in my book.  The garlic bread complimented this dish perfectly for dipping.You should definitely make reservations if you decide to come here.",4 star rating,Angela C.

Secondly front desk attendant were sweet as well as the bar tending staff but it truly takes one working with a poor  attitude to ruin a visit. He was very disrespectful to my mother with his tone and the way he spoke to her and then his attitude towards me made me want just wAlk out and go elsewhere. People like  thIs man should not be in the front end with customers if they have this  attitude and temperament. If I could rate a zero star I would.

Once again, we enjoyed our brunch here.This time, I tried the Boathouse Omelette and was very pleased with the quality of the spinach and seafood (lobster and spinach) inside. My dad tried the Huevos Rancheros, and he was quite happy with his dish.I also tried the Renegade Pixie, and I felt the magic... of some great flavor with a nice, boozy kick. It has just the right amount of rum (Flor de Cana Anejo here). And while it's on the sweet side, it's refreshingly fruity and doesn't just taste like liquid candy.And of course, you can't beat the location here: Right on Arroyo Burro Beach (aka Hendry's Beach) in Santa Barbara. Be warned that parking isn't always easy to find here.

Our cocktails was decent nothing to rave about that Bloody Marty was very stiff, even too strong for my husband.We really enjoyed the rock crab claws and the raw oysters.  The Manhattan clams chowder was full of fish, I wish there were more clams in it but it was good.We came for the Uni but they didn't have any that day.  So we try the scallops, it's not my favorite but my husband said he like it.  Scallops just didn't taste as fresh as it could be and was a bit bland, I tasted a bite and my husband ate the rest.So that was one dish out of all the dish I ordered is not bad, but overall it was a great fun place to enjoy the sunshine and people watch as well.The high tops are first come first served so if you waited long enough or get lucky like we did you would be right next to the window with beach front view.We will be back the next time we are in town for sure.",5 star rating,Toni L.

When the weather is perfect it makes the experience beautiful as it is so close to the ocean/dog beach. My salmon eggs Benedict were very fresh, delicious, and filling. My only critique being a suggestion on slicing the onions a lot thinner as they became a little overwhelming for my taste. My fiance ordered the Boathouse Omellete which had both lobster and shrimp stuffed inside of it. Although I didn't try it, it looked amazing and the chunks of lobster were huge.

6/9/2018,"Ann Arbor, MI","Overpriced and not worth the large bill at the end in my opinion. Let's talk about the good. The view? Awesome. Wall to wall windows and large mirrors make it feel large and spacious. You cannot get closer to the water!The oysters were fresh! Worth the price point. I wish we had more. That's about it for the good news. Everything else was so-so. My brother and my dad got the uni shooters. It's the first time they've ever had it. Both have said they would not get it again. It was too sour for their liking. Maybe they ordered wrong, but there was way too much going on in He shooter. It was almost intimidating to eat.I ordered the cioppino. I was underimpressed for something that I usually like in general. It basically was a bunch of seafood in minestrone soup...and some garlic bread...for $25. The fish in it was tough and tasteless. The shellfish was pretty yummy. But the crab was hard to eat without any type of shellfish cracker or mini forks. I couldn't finish it. My mom got the scallops. They looked yummy and were huge! So that's a plus. But the broccoli was tough and my mom couldn't cut through the outer skin. Why they didn't skin the broccoli is beyond me.My brother likes his sea bass tho! He would recommend it. He wiped his plate clean.The bathroom made me feel like I was in a murder movie...pale hospital colors meets horror flick. Overall I give it a neutral 3 out of 5 stars.

9/26/2020,"Flagstaff, AZ","Mmm not worth the 2hr wait to be honest. I think I had more fun just sippin mimosas. Tried to come here for brunch and ended up just coming for lunch because of the time. They're lunch menu isn't the greatest. We ordered the oysters, fish n chips, lobster rolls, fish tacos and a pasta. It was ehh. The fish tacos looked hella sad and the portion of rice was laughable. For the price they charged I don't think it was worth it. Not sure I'll come again. Worth the shot but won't be coming back again.",3 star rating,Alexandra M.
4/24/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","The epitome of Santa Barbara Brunch. Adjacent to the beach and surrounded by hilltops, this scenic restaurant delivers quality brunch with spectacular views and the freshest of air. Be warned, this is a popular locale and parking may be limited on weekends but is worth the wait should you want to indulge in quality brunch. They do not take reservations on weekends but do offer a buzzer system which makes it perfect to grab a drink and chit-chat along the bar as you wait for your table. Being an eggs benedict aficionado, I am never disappointed with the quality that the Boathouse delivers. My suggestion. Wake up early, wait if need be, and take your time as you enjoy the crashing of the waves with a fine drink in hand. Any memory created here is one not to forget.",5 star rating,Rick S.
5/1/2018,"Knoxville, TN","Beachfront restaurant that offers an nice view and nothing more. The seafood aftertaste lasted the entire night. The skuna bay salmon on a bed of lobster mashed potatoes tasted like microwaveable mashed potatoes and lean cuisine salmon. The wine sauce was a tease because you can hardly taste the sauce. The salmon and mashed potatoes were rather dry for a dish that included wine sauce. The spinach was overly cooked and just put onto the mashed potatoes as some kind of decor. Thank god i ordered an order a side of garlic bread to dip into my friends soup. We all ordered a seafood dish, and regretted that decision within an hour. Stomach ache and fish aftertaste lasted an entire night.The only plus was the view and the banana foster desert",3 star rating,Rita S.
6/30/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Sunday brunch at the Boathouse, always a fabulous view, always a bit of a wait. Totally worth it though! Arrive early and take a stroll on the beach while you wait for your table. Wait times will be longer for the prime ocean patio seats, but again, worth it! The food is solid! I had the pork belly Benedict. The potatoes were AMAZING! I've noticed that during weekend brunch rushes most places seem to undercook the potatoes, probably because they take so long and there's such high demand, but not here, they were perfection. I was disappointed that the eggs were over cooked, so I didn't get that magical runny yolk moment. My avocado also looked a bit rough. I had some bites of the Santa Barbara Omelette and the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. The omelette was packed with fresh veggies that were perfectly cooked! Not too under or overdone, which happens so often with omelette. The salmon Benedict was also delicious, but the same over cooked egg issue. We also tried a couple of drinks. The Boathouse Punch was tropical and delicious, but very sweet! I opted for the rubarb and blood orange spritzer, which was more my style being less sweet. I thought it was delicious, but if you don't like rubarb you definitely won't like this drink. If you do though, this is a solid spritz, which fit with the beachy summer vibes. Also shout out to the amazing staff that kept flipping tables and kept services flowing without ever making us feel rushed or in the way! I always keep coming back whenever I need to show guests the beauty of Santa Barbara, or when I need some yummy food with good vibes.",4 star rating,Shannon K.
4/15/2019,"Sacramento, CA","The Boathouse at Hendry's Beach dishes up your run of the mill seafood centric americana fare. I can't say that the food was particularly memorable, but the location and views can't be beat.  We choose to dine at the Boathouse after spending a few hours enjoying the beach and surf with our pup.  We were looking pretty grubby, wearing flip flops, a towel, and covered in sand , but the the hostess was still very welcoming and told us our wait was about 20 minutes for a table. It was cool because it allowed us to tidy up a bit before sitting down for dinner. Not sure if dogs are allowed to sit with you on the patio , but I did see a cute little ""doggy station"" where you can leash  your pup and have them chill while you're eating. Now our pup is not that chill... he would whine and bark through the entire evening if we decided to let him hang out like that . Luckily it was a cool evening , he was tired and hungry , so we were able to feed him his dinner and then let him sleep in the car with the ocean breeze to keep him happy. The entire restaurant is designed to really take advantage of the beach side ocean views . The interior of the restaurant had large open windows and you can see the ocean from just about any seat inside. The outside patio is just as big as the inside seating area . They have multiple heat lamps and market lights to add to the comfort and the ambience. Now if you time your dinner just right , you will be blessed with the most beautiful sunset while enjoying your meal. All your worries will melt away when you feel the ocean breeze against your skin, hear the rhythmic waves crashing on the beach, and see the red and orange sunset blaze across the sky. It's magical.I wish I could say that the food was amazing as the views, but instead the food just typical...not exceptional and kind of boring. The menu was a bit limited . I saw several seafood and fish entrees, and not much else. I was really craving a burger and I was sad that I didn't see one listed on the menu. When I asked our server about the lack of a burger , she told me that the kitchen should be able to make one for me despite it not being on the dinner menu.  I thought that was cool and appreciated the extra effort .  Along with the burger, my dinner mate for life ordered some kind of pasta dish and an appetizer of ahi poke . The wait for our food wasn't long , and we were also served warm bread and butter before hand . My burger with fries was decent. It was very basic, but tasted good enough. The ahi poke was again very basic, and I feel like I could have gotten something similar at one of those chain-y poke bowl places that keep popping up everywhere. The pasta dish was pretty good too, but nothing to write home about.   Service was ok as well. Our server was sweet , but towards the middle and end of our meal it was difficult to flag her down and it took forever to get our check. Besides that nothing was horrible here. The positives certainly outweighs any minor negatives. I would enjoy another opportunity to dine here at the Boathouse on the beach .",4 star rating,Brenda B.
4/12/2018,"Simi Valley, CA","Fabulous location, sharing a parking lot with Arroyo Burro Beach.  Formerly the Brown Pelican, as Dear Hubby and I recall, they have done a number of renovations to create the current Boathouse.  Though parking was really hard to come by last Sunday in the late afternoon, DH persisted and snagged a spot.  He had dropped me off, so I worked on getting us a table.  I waited for one on the patio after trying inside.  Though they have huge picture windows and a killer view of the Pacific, it was a little too warm inside for me, even with the large bar windows and the front door open.  The big windows are fixed, and little side ones don't draw in much breeze.The hostess stand team was gracious to shift us to an outdoor table, as soon as one came free.  Once settled, our excellent waiter took over.  It was easy to see how all the staff works together, from hosts to bussers, to servers, to keep everything flowing smoothly.  They turn tables quickly, to give lots of diners a chance to enjoy the setting.When they first changed from Brown Pelican to the Boathouse, I thought their prices were high.  Now, the rest of the dining world has caught up, and I think they're fairly priced for the quality of the food, the level of service, and the amazing setting, right at the foot of the beach.We enjoyed sharing a bowl of well-seasoned clam chowder, plus a plate of fish and chips.  It was what I was craving, for some reason.  Their version is made with panko crumbs, versus a batter.  The fish was flaky and tender & succulent inside.They have gorgeous looking salads, and lots of other seafood dishes, of course.  Fish tacos almost won me over, but I stuck with the original plan.  The salads were huge and picture-perfect.Happy hour was on, but you have to squeeze in to the bar area to take advantage of food and drink specials.  It was totally full when we arrived, so that didn't happen.Apparently, they don't offer bread during the lunch hours.  I did see it being served to diners who came later.  We arrived about 3:45, so still caught the lunch menu.  By 5:00 they shift to dinner service.We'll surely be back again when in Santa Barbara.  It's good to experience a well-oiled restaurant machine every so often.  Especially one right by the blue ocean!",4 star rating,Lianne K.

My husband added some salt and  did have a few spoons....I ordered tuna melt that was ok and kids had pasta and chicken tenders.My husband ordered fish tacos and he hated them.

I don't know.  It was 3pm and the hunger struck on my drive towards Santa Barbara.  A quick Yelp search brought up this place and oh my gawd. I was in love. Perfect location on the beach,  so private and secluded. The outdoor seating had heaters galore.  And the drinks were amazing.  And I consider myself a bloody Mary snob.  So that's saying a lot.  This being a seafood places, I was excited to order the crab claws on the menu.  Unfortunately they were out! By 3pm! That's crazy.  And a little sad. But not too worry, I got fried calamari and the seafood pasta.  And it did not disappoint.  The seafood pasta was plentiful and I couldn't get enough of the sauce,  I would have taken it in a glass and drank it on its own.  If you haven't been here yet.  Do yourself a favor and go!

3/29/2018,"Oakland, CA",Eating here is mostly for the nice view of the beach and set up outside. I wouldn't say there's anything very special about this place from what I ordered. I ordered the crab cakes since it's their Signature Breakfast. But I felt like they lacked seasoning and fell a bit flat for me. But they were crispy and decent size. My friend got an omelete and thought it was decent.There weren't that many menu items to choose from other than typical breakfast items so I don't know if there's anything I'd come back to try.

7/10/2019,"San Francisco, CA","Came here on a Saturday around noon with a party of 6 and were able to easily find parking. The wait was about 45 minutes, which wasn't a big deal because the restaurant is right on the beach and we wanted to hang out near the water.I ordered the Bloody Mary, which I thought was a great price solely based on the toppings (included a full strip of bacon, shrimp, celery, the works). My friend and I ended up splitting the Cioppino ($22.95) and the Boathouse Signature Breakfast (essentially crab cake benedicts, $16.95). This place seemed a little touristy, but I was pleasantly surprised by the cioppino! Wish there were more scallops and crab though. The broth was flavorful, and the dish came with two large slices of garlic bread. The benedict was also good but pretty standard, both the crab cakes and eggs were cooked perfectly. Loved the breakfast potatoes on the side! Wish there were more.Overall, this was a slight splurge on brunch money wise, but it was worth it for the location and the amount/type of food that we ordered. Would dine here again if I was visiting from out of town, but likely wouldn't frequent here if I was local to Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Sydney M.

We waited for over two hours and the favoritism for groups versus two people dining was obvious. They didn't assign seating based on first come first serve but if you came as a group, you're more than likely to get seated first! The hostess was extremely rude, lying to my husband and I about our table and seeing a group take our spot afterwards. Then telling us to wait longer.

6/24/2019,"Oakland, CA","I am not a huge seafood fan, but my family came here for my sister's graduation and had a remarkable time. From start to finish, service was astonishingly good. The restaurant was extremely busy, but everyone was taken care of in a personal and timely manner. Our server even endured my dad's lame humor, which is a testament to his exceptional hospitality.Everyone enjoyed their meal here. Some things were a bit expensive and I wouldn't order them again, but still so good. Price is really my only complaint.Coconut shrimp: there were literally 4 for $13.95... but they were really big and tasty, so maybe that's okay...? I dunno, man.Lobster and truffle mac and cheese: incredible. So flavorful. Good portion.Ceviche: this was really quite a lot of food for $12.95. It was enough for all 7 of us to have a good amount. Beet and citrus salad: wow, this was probably my favorite. It was SO fresh. Truly don't skimp on any of the ingredients because there was an abundance of beets and goat cheese and arugula. It was just terrifying the next day when I pooped and it was entirely dark red and I thought I was dying until I remembered this meal.Salmon: wow, cooked to perfection. Not only is it a decent chunk of fish, the lobster mashed potatoes are also plentiful. Not a huge amount of veggies, but decent. Conveniently for the restaurant, they were out of the usual salmon and had a different catch that was $10 more.. anyways... I just pretended that was okay and smiled because grandma's paying so whatever.No comments on drinks because they were great, as expected.

3/31/2019,"Riverside, CA","This place is a nautical dream! Never have I enjoyed an hour long wait time more than I have here. The restaurant sits right along the beach, so we didn't mind at all waiting for our table. I got the tuna melt sandwich and my boyfriend got the ahi club, but the ahi club ultimately won out. Absolutely delicious, definitely order it. Menu selection is tailored, of course, more for seafood lovers, but non-seafood eaters aren't left completely in the dark. There is only a couple of non-seafood items on the menu, but then again if you aren't looking for fishy foods then maybe don't come to a beachside restaurant. Great drink selection, and the view is fantastic. Has a rather refined, sailor-like ambience. My server was the sweetest and gave us prompt attention.

My friend and I stopped by for a late lunch after Mesa Cafe disappointed us with their weekend lunchtime options, and boy, we did not regret it.Immediately upon entrance, our hostess (who was wearing the coolest leather jacket) seated us and handed off a pair of menus. We snagged a table inside, basking in the warm sunlight. Not long after, when it got too bright, another server pulled down the blinds for us with little fuss. The service here was swift and polite, and we had no problems getting our food.My friend ordered the fish and chips, while I got the rockfish ceviche. The ceviche did not disappoint. Everything was gloriously marinated, with fresh pico de gallo adding a nice, sharp bite. When i ran out of chips, there was still plenty of avocado and ceviche left on top of the base tostada for what almost felt like a second meal. I walked away feeling light and happy with the high quality of food here. I can't say much about the fish and chips, other than that the portion seemed enormous (three giant slabs of fish and a boatload of fries). We had fairly inexpensive meals by Boathouse standards (averaging $14).All their options seem delicious, so I'm eager to return and taste their breakfast and full dinner menus. Also, their happy hour seems amazing -- 3 p.m. to close? Score! I'll definitely come again for what looked like gorgeous chowder fries and a drink.",4 star rating,Gwen W.

The view from the restaurant is gorgeous. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is heated, so no worries there. The food is also delicious.

Like wow, great in terms of quality and quantity. Ahi Tuna Sandwich -- Love that there was a thick slice of tuna. The flavors were right and the quality tasted fresh. Also, it looks like it has beach views all around, as if the place was on a pier or an island-- but the 'windows' in the back are actually mirrors.

7/1/2019,"Arlington, TX","FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN SANTA BARBARA!!!!My God, how I love this place!Best view Best foodBest staffAmazing cocktails Great happy hourWhat's better than having the best meal In town with a beach view?....having all the above and my new buddy Nick as you waiter! Seriously, he even wrote a list of places for me to check out for drinks & other good food but I was already at the best place in town honestly. Thanks man. That's what you call excellent service....because of him and the good food, my coworker and I have eaten here almost everyday for a week!! He wasn't there every time  but even if the service wasn't as amazing, the food alone would have brought us back.....we will not be leaving with out going one last time. Please do yourself a favor and get some flavor! Try the seafood pasta it is AMAZING (I like to order it Spicy). The Ciopinno is also amazing and full of flavor, not as much flavor as the seafood pasta but I'd order either one again in a heartbeat! Both options give you a great size serving, we are both 6 feet talk and leave full, satisfied and happy as hell with our meal EVERYTIME.",5 star rating,Jeremy K.

1/6/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA",Easily one of my top brunch spots in the sb area. I come here at least once a month because i have had a great experience every time. I start with the clam chowder fries (A MUST) and then get the signature breakfast. Both are so tasty and have not found a better substitute anywhere in the area.Only complaint i would have is that there is always a wait. They do not take reservations on the weekend so definitely expect at least a 30 minutes wait. Luckily the beach is full of dogs and the time passes quickly. I do believe that there is a table area that you can sit at by the bar as people leave the tables to avoid the wait.,4 star rating,Megan S.

I assumed the restaurant would be over-priced and not good because the location was so good! Boy, was I wrong! Hostesses were very accomodating. Server was informed and helpful. Atmosphere cannot be beat! We left our towels on the sand and ate barefoot overlooking​ the bach. My kiddo ordered the most perfect meal imaginable!... fries covered in clam chowder and topped with bacon. How is that not on every menu!? I had the fish tacos and the portion was super generous. I was stuffed! Came with guac, salsa, chips, rice, and 2 big tacos.

We got here around 10:30 am (prime brunch time I know) and waited about 40minutes to be seated. But it didn't feel so long because the beach is literally right in front of you and you just people and dog watch and tan a little! We got the boathouse punch and the blackberry mai tai. Omg the boathouse punch definitely wins the game- it was just perfect for brunch by the beach. Got the original eggs benedict and it was all right. Also got the omelette also was all right. I think the food is average but the view and the vibe is what makes this place a one of a kind restaurant. I would come here again! Parking can be tough as it fills up quickly and people who are at the beach also uses the lot. Seriously though get the punch and thank me later.",4 star rating,Catharine L.

1/23/2019,"Carlsbad, CA",My husband and I decided to take a day trip to Santa Barbara for the day. We stopped here for a light lunch. I wanted to get clam chowder in on my trip and my husband is a fan of crab cakes. The chowder was loaded with potatoes and clams. Very tasty. My husband said that the crab cakes were a bit dense due to the breading. It was still good but not the best we had. The restaurant was busy but we were seated in less than 15 mins. The only downside was that we were seated next to a very large party who was doing some celebrating (not the fault of the restaurant). Overall it was a nice place with a beach view worth checking out.,4 star rating,Trecia L.

This place is always PACKED!I ordered the grilled tofu with mango sticky rice and coconut sauce.

1/8/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","The Boathouse is a solid and consistent choice for any meal or just drinks with a view. We had come here previously on a few occasions for dinner and drinks but we recently came for brunch and I'm so happy we did. Firstly, service was phenomenal even though it was really busy. Our server brought my son oyster crackers ""to tie him over"" even though the food didn't take that long to come out and also brought us a large carafe of water for the table. She also brought three kinds of hot sauce to choose from (Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatio) and I appreciated the variety. Onto the food: My corned beef hash was delicious and the portion size was insane. I only wish the potatoes were roasted longer because most of the pieces were still kind of hard. My husband ordered the chilaquiles which were also very good, but the salsa verde was not spicy at all. This needed lots of hot sauce. The beans were also really good. I could tell because he normally doesn't eat beans but he scraped those black beans up. The only plate I was disappointed with was the pancake I ordered for my son. It was just really thick and it had eight very thin slices of banana on top of it. He didn't eat very much of it but it's okay because there was more than enough corned beef hash for the both of us. Overall the food was good and the service was great so we definitely plan to come back for brunch soon. I would just come before 10 because after 10, it seemed like there was a bit of a wait.",4 star rating,Lani G.

12/17/2017,"Camarillo, CA","Wow what a gem! Clearly Boathouse doesn't need an introduction. Amazing views of the water, nestled away back along the coast of Santa Barbara, this place is sure to impress. Amazing food and friendly staff I can't wait to come back.Around the holidays we came for brunch on Sunday. The wait appeared to be long if you wanted to sit outside but we opted for inside and we're sat right away. Plenty of indoor seating with a window view of the ocean.My review is strictly for brunch:Menu was about a page long. Great BenedictS, pancakes, breakfast meats, healthy options, omelets you name it. Also the drink menu is amazing! Bloody Mary's, classics, mimosas I was pleasantly surprised.I opted for the boathouse cocktail made with nutmeg and coconut/banana it was delicious. They make a mean strong (but delicious) drink!Now for my brunch I ordered the salmon Benedict. I can safely safe it was the best salmon Benedict I've ever had! The salmon pieces were hug! They don't skimp here, crunchy fresh onion, capers and an amazing sauce. I'll continue to come here for brunch time and time again if I can order this. It's a must please try!Our server was friendly and quick. Very pleasant experience all around. You can't beat the view and the food. Casual enough for a weekend brunch but pretty enough for an amazing date at the beach.Give this place a try they deserve your business.",5 star rating,Melissa L.

3/2/2020,"Altadena, CA","I have really mixed feelings about this spot from a recent visit. Came by around 11:15 AM on a Friday and it was quite busy. The seating hostess was very friendly and tried to accommodate a request to sit by the water in the shade. Ended up waiting 20 or so minutes to sit in the second row near the water which was sunny and not as close to the water, but we had already waited so we made do. We sat down and ordered our meals. The waitress asked if we were celebrating anything and we told her we were on our way to our anniversary trip. I ordered the cioppino and my boyfriend got a short stack of berry pancakes and the mesquite grilled catch of the day (salmon). We got the pancakes first, which were very good. The rest of our food was taking longer than usual to come out so the waitress very kindly came back and asked us if we wanted any soup or salads on the house while we waited. I ordered a cup of the clam chowder which was pretty good. Our food came quickly after that. The lunch food was disappointing. My cioppino was a let down - it tasted a bit too fishy which tells me it wasn't the freshest. Additionally, I burned my tongue when I got to the center of the dish, which makes me think they microwaved my dish. My boyfriend said his fish was lackluster. Lunch left a bad taste in our mouths but then the waitress kindly brought over some dessert - a mudslide sundae - with a candle as an anniversary treat. It was very thoughtful of her and we weren't expecting it! Overall, our experience at the Boathouse had lots of ups and downs. The service was good despite some setbacks and the food was hit or miss - bringing this place to 3 stars. If we ever come back I think I'd choose to sit indoors and stick to the breakfast menu!",3 star rating,Mary H.

The chowder fries were delicious. The chowder was brine-y, thick and filled with clams; as a chowder should be. Really enjoyed this dish.However, the ahi ahi tuna dish we had was forgettable as was the fish tacos and whatever other dish my bf had.Overall, great restaurant as far as drinks and ambience goes.

I got the signature breakfast that was crab cakes and poached eggs and it was the perfect portion and such a great balance of flavor.

10/28/2018,"Seattle, WA","Why didn't I know about this spot when I lived in Santa Barbara?? Boathouse at Henry's Beach is so cute and is located quite literally on the beach. Definitely the most picturesque location I've ever been to for happy hour. For happy hour, you get to sit outside under umbrellas while watching the waves crashing onto the shore. Doesn't get much better than that. There is a free parking lot for the beach that you can park at, but it gets pretty busy. We did have to wait a few minutes for a tabletop in the bar area for happy hour, but it wasn't a big deal as we just hung out at the bar and ordered drinks. Once we had a tabletop, we ordered a few snacks from the HH menu - the mussels and the fish and chips. Both were more than reasonably priced (less than $10 each I believe!), and the portion sizes were way better than I had anticipated.  The seafood was fresh and I loved the tomato sauce/soup that the mussels came with. The experience was wonderful and is a must-try if you're in town.",5 star rating,Angel B.

I came around 12pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of available seating inside the restaurant. The patio is of course more crowded. We opt to sit outside to get some sunlight. I ordered the Seafood Pasta and my boyfriend got the ceviche plate. I appreciated that they didn't skim out on the seafood - I actually couldn't finish the whole plate. However, I also thought the flavors were underwhelming. Not sure if I would come back here again but if I do, I would try their cocktails - looks good!

2/12/2020,"Costa Mesa, CA","If I could vouch for one restaurant you should avoid while visiting Santa Barbara, Boathouse would be that restaurant. I know you read, ""If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would"" a lot on yelp, but I have never meant that more now. Let me start off with what we ordered.Two clam chowders: Cold, goopy, and powdery. We poured Tabasco in just to get it down (I wish this was an exaggeration).Mussels: once our waitress dropped them off at  the table you could smell them. I don't mean your typical mussel smell, it was a pungent fishy smell. We were all hesitant to eat them. Once we tried them we spit them out. I've never tasted a mussel like that. It was definitely bad. Bad enough the manager agreed they smelled bad and he told the cooks to dump all the mussels. There's no way a seasoned chef couldn't smell that and then send it out to customers. Are you trying to get people sick?Seared Tuna Appetizer: Tuna was grey. If you have ever had seared tuna or are familiar with tuna you would know this was poor quality and should not be eaten. The slaw under the tuna was good. But if you  need a mountain of slaw to camouflage the taste of your poor quality tuna.. you have a bigger problem. Pan seared scallops with lobster risotto: the scallops came out looking like crap. I wish I was joking. The scallops were disgusting and the risotto was one of the worst risotto we have ever tried. Hands down one of the worst dishes you could order. Kids chicken tender meal: after 45 mins of the adults picking at their food, my daughter's meal never came. So that was really good. She's 6, and if you are familiar with a hungry 6 year old then you know my pain. Here's the best part  So that's what we ordered and how it all turned out. Now let me talk about customer service, or lack there of. Our waitress Alex (female blonde hair): she was nice in the beginning when taking our orders. We asked if we could bring in our wine and she chilled it for us. The wine never chilled with the few pieces  of ice she threw in the vase. So we never got to even enjoy our wine with dinner. When we told her about the mussels she was kind of cool about it and offered a new appetizer, that's when we got the seared tuna as I mentioned above. Which was inedible as well, any other chef would have canned the tuna and never plated it for customers. When we told her about the tuna, our waitress went from nice to sour in a blink of an eye. We asked her to have the chef try the tuna because it wasn't right. She smirked condescendingly and said ""I'll see what I can do"". We also asked if she could put more ice on the wine so it would chill faster and we told her its not cold. She just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Very weird response. She acted as if she cooked those dishes and we offended her. Once we told her about the scallops she sent the manager over. Good god. I do not know who the hell up in corporate let this man be manager but bless his heart. Just helpless, he kind of added fuel to the fire.... he offered more and more food but there's no way anyone had an appetite at the table, well, maybe just my daughter, who never got her food, but no one else.Update: we went back today and spoke to Brandon the manager (a different one than last night) and he agreed we were not treated properly and apologized and made the wrong right. So thanK you Brandon for taking time out to look into this.",1 star rating,Morgan-Emilee A.

We were told an hour and a half wait, understandable for such a great restaurant right on the beach. The host told us our buzzers would work in the car (it was freezing outside). We came in repeatedly to check on our time just in case. Finally after an hour and 45 we were getting slightly annoyed. The host told us she had been calling us but our buzzers went out of range, even though she was the one who told us we could sit in the car. Then to fix her mistake she tried to sit us in a dark corner table right behind her host stand with no light or heat lamp, plus was just not a warm friendly person in general. Normally idc about that but we waited so long, we wanted a better valentines day experience than that.

For my entree I went with the seafood pasta that had fish, scallops and shrimp. I asked for the pasta not to be too spicy and they made it just perfectly. My bf had the sea bass which I got to taste and it was really good. We were too full for dessert and I even took half of my pasta to go. The food here was excellent and simply delicious. You can't beat the ocean view and the prices super affordable . One appetizer, 2 entrees and two glasses of wine $87 before gratuity. I wish I live closer to this place because I would be coming here every weekend.",5 star rating,Isabel J.

9/18/2019,"Oakland, CA","My family came here as a celebration lunch after my 10k race was over. We were told the view would be incredible and it was, though we were not close to the window. Then again that's the sacrifice you make if you sit in the more comfortable booths. We ordered a number of things, but my review is really about the uni. My parents had never tried it, but my friend (who is Japanese) and I are both fiends about good fresh uni. And it turns out most of the good fresh uni we had tried in the San Francisco Bay Area was shipped over from Santa Barbara. So if we were here we had to get it from the source. We ordered it at The Boathouse, and it was everything we wanted and more. The sea urchin carcass that the insides were carved from sat atop the dish in all its spiky glory, and its buttery foie gras-like innards were partitioned out atop a slice of sea scallop and blood orange. Five pieces was quite an indulgence, and I lapped mine up in one breath. My parents were shockingly not fans, but as I understand it, uni is an acquired taste. To each their own I suppose, but it was definitely an experience I sought and won.",5 star rating,Sheena C.

10/19/2018,"Redlands, CA","I've been vacationing in Santa Barbara since childhood, so I know the area pretty well. But when I needed to know the best place with ocean view dining for my mom's 75th birthday, I turned to Yelp. Never having been to the Boathouse before, I went in entirely on the photos and reviews. Nothing much else to say except that: that have so many 5-star reviews for a reason! Can't beat the view, and the food was delicious! Our Fliet Mignon was done perfectly, melted in my mouth. The lobster was HUGE so we only needed one to split between the two us, and it was light, buttery, and very tasty. A friend had given us a bottle of wine and I was pleased with the very modest corking fee. Reservations are recommended,  and make sure you get there about 15-20 mins before so you have time to find parking, as it can be limited, especially at peak hours. Finally, the service. Everything from making reservations to being greeted, Sat and served was top notch. I have to really commend Sam, out waiter. He was awesome, attentive without being over bearing, and a super cool dude. He made my mom's birthday extra special. I definitely recommend this place and now it is a must-go whenever I'm in town.",5 star rating,Mike A.

The prices were a bit on the higher end, it was about $60 plus tip for 4 of us. But I think based on the quality food and amazing view it is worth the $. I gotta say that this place has an amazing view. We sat outside looking out towards the ocean. If you sit inside you also get to see the amazing view through huge windows.

7/25/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Two Words that changed my life forever: CHOWDER FRIESI asked for a boozy brunch with great food, stiff drinks and beach views and my native SB friend took me to the Boathouse.  We arrive at around 11am on a Sunday without a reservation and the place was packed--it was about an hour wait which was no problem as we were able to squeeze in at the bar to order drinks.The ambiance is stunning.  It's everything I would want in a beachfront restaurant.  They have an outdoor patio that overlooks the beach and is permeated with that unmistakable salty sea breeze.  The indoor seating is bright and airy.  I love the huge windows that showcase the stunning ocean view.  It feels very California and upscale but without pretense.Seafood is the main focus of the menu.  We came for brunch and I was blown away by the choices which all sounded so good. We started with CHOWDER FRIES which are in contention for the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.  The chowder is so creamy, decadent and full of chunks of fresh clams.  The fries are crisp and stand up well to the creamy sauce.  It's like poutine but better.  An honorable mention is the Boathouse Signature Breakfast which is a poached egg on top of a CRAB CAKE.  The crab cakes are legit with huge chunks of snow and rock crabs.Prices are shockingly fair for a beachfront venue with such fresh seafood.  Entrees are mostly under $30 and drinks are in the $10-12 range. I look forward to coming back for dinner.  I imagine a sunset dinner would be magical and I MUST try their lobster truffle mac n cheese.Prices are shockingly fair for a beachfront venue with such fresh seafood.  Breakfast and lunch entrees are mostly under $20 and dinner entrees are mostly under $30 with drinks in the $10-12 range.",5 star rating,Lisa W.

9/2/2019,"Burbank, CA",The best part of this restaurant is the view. It's sits right on a secluded beach. We visited in a busy Sunday night of Labor Day weekend. We were seated within 15 minutes upon arrival. We had a great seat with the view is the ocean. Our waitress was super friendly. My husband ordered the clams appetizer and cioppino for dinner. He was very happy with his choice. I ordered the crab cakes with no sauce. They served them with sauce all over them. They quickly replaced them although the second order wasn't cooked fully. I ate half the order. I also ordered the salmon with white wine sauce and lobster potatoes. The mashed potatoes were great although the salmon was bland. I rarely add salt to my food and had to go make it taste decent. We would recommend this place overall.,4 star rating,Yamel M.
11/11/2017,"Fountain Valley, CA","I've heard good things about this place, so decided to stop by for a Friday lunch date. The parking was free and didn't have too much trouble finding parking, but it was pretty crowded. Went around 2 PM on a Friday, the wait without reservations were around 40-45ish minutes for sitting in the front porch. My date and I was willing to wait and they had a buzzer. So during the wait, we took a nice walk around the beach. Eventually we got seated, and the view is of course great! It was a nice sunny day with clouds, cool ocean breeze, pretty view of the ocean, and chill atmosphere.For drinks, my date ordered the honey comb mojito, while I got the blood orange margarita. The drinks menu was a decent size, and we both liked our drinks. My date got the shrimp taco, since the waitress suggested it over the fish taco. I tried a bit, and it was yummy. I got the steak frites and the steak was pretty good. If I were to go again, I'd go during dinner to try out the filet mignon. The fries that came with my steak were just whatever in my opinion. The portion sizes for everything were just okay. I wouldn't say very generous or small, just okay. I thought the meal + drinks were alright priced, considering it's a nicer restaurant next to the beach. Overall, I enjoyed the view by the beach, the place had a very nice vibe, the food + drinks were not bad, and I would definitely go back for dinner/happy hour next time! I think this is a good place to go with friends or a place to take someone on a date, since it has drinks + good view + good food!",4 star rating,Theodore V.

7/18/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","The service, the food, and especially the STUNNING location makes this place one of the best in town! This beautiful restaurant is located right on the beach, with its own parking lot which is awesome! It has a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Even when sitting indoors you are able to see outside because of the big glass windows that surround the inside seating area.  They have a great selection of breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner options.  I came here with my sister when she was in town about two weeks ago for the first time in awhile. We came in the middle of the day on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We were able to get a seat right at the bar and order food along with our drinks here! For our drinks we had a Bloody Mary & Blackberry Mai Tai! Both were super delicious and not too sweet which we liked! We LOVED that the bloody mary came with bacon with it. Such an awesome great touch! For our food we ordered the steamed black mussels and the fried calamari. Both came out at the same time and were really good!! Even for appetizers the portions were very large. The staff is always so friendly and the drinks along with the food are always great!

1/11/2020,"Isla Vista, CA","I came with a party of 5 around 11:15AM on Saturday and waited 30 mins to be seated. We ordered the Boathouse Signature Breakfast, Pork Belly Benedict, Grilled Tofu, and Seafood Pasta. The signature had two eggs benedict, each on top of a crab cake, it was decent and a classic, but it wasn't anything special. My vegan, vegetable-loving friend hated the veggies on the Grilled Tofu. She said it was tasteless and the sticky rice was actually just mushy, broken rice. Sticky rice is not the same as mushy, overcooked rice. It's a different type of grain. The pork belly benedict wasn't too fatty and the fat was rendered really well. This dish was probably the best our party ordered. The seafood pasta was very fishy and it was obvious it had been sitting in a freezer for a while before it was served to us. The fish was tough and gray and tasted rough and fishy on the tongue. The ""spicy"" marinara was not spicy and they actually burned our garlic bread too. We barely touched it at the end. We let our server know that the fish seemed off and he notified the manager. They told us they would figure out what went wrong and took it off our bill. Overall, the service was great, he was very attentive and patient, and the view of the ocean was beautiful. Taking a stroll on the beach while waiting to be seated made the experience very enjoyable.",3 star rating,Annie B.

8/7/2017,"Northridge, CA","What a cute hidden gem on the beach in Santa Barbara!My lovely daughter and I found this place by mistake. The restaurant is adjacent to the beach and we were pleasantly surprised there was no parking fee, yay! Kind of reminded me of Paradise Cove in Malibu. However, the restaurant lacked in seating us with a miscommunication with their host. He  informed us that we would be seated right away inside but to go wait by their 'fireplace'. We waited and waited and apparently he forgot about us?!! So I had to ask how much longer and he then 'remembered' and sat us----ah ok.We had an ocean view however, their table arrangement is quite odd. I could not enjoy the view since my back was seated away from the view but you had to look straight into the wall mirror, wth?!   I was happy my daughter got to enjoy it though.  Their clam chowder was fairly good but their calamari was over fried and I would have preferred a marinara sauce for dipping instead of the mayo type dressing they served with it. Their wedge salad was fresh and flavorful though. All in all we will probably not be back to dine inside but rather the patio instead. Or we will just opt to come and lay out by the beach and order their food from their take out side instead. In which they offer their clam chowder, corn dogs, ice cream, etc. We also loved the fact this area is dog friendly.",3 star rating,Leese V.

I ordered the crab cakes benedict and my date ordered the Santa Barbara omelette and I was absolutely blown away. The drinks menu was pretty diverse and I particularly enjoyed the bloody mary they have here. Best of all the view of the ocean here is pretty epic, whether you sit on the patio or inside you get a spectacular view of the waves while indulging on some of the best brunch food in the local area. The portions here were very generous and the price point was awesome especially for the fresh ingredients the staff here cook with.

Honestly, the place is picturesque and the perfect spot for brunch. Service is also fantastic.Food: after a few days of Disneyland food, fresh food and good drinks felt like a heavenly intervention. The arugula gimlet and honey mojito were well balanced and refreshing. We had the ahi poke app which had a good amount of pepper and seaweed salad. I had the signature breakfast (crab cakes with poached eggs) and subbed the potatoes with bacon (so healthy).

The menu, while simple and easy to choose from, has some incredible concoctions you will definitely want to try out on ""cheat day.""I came by, myself, on a Tuesday evening right at prime dinner time around 5:00 pm. We had the option of Happy Hour seating outside or ocean front indoors and we chose indoors and it was a little breezy for our liking outside. We were seated in a matter of seconds and approached by a waiter with our waters within a minute. I ordered the Tuna Melt and a Blood Orange Margarita and my boyfriend got the Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese (off the lunch menu). The portions were very generous, the wait staff were extremely kind, the margarita was one of the best I've had, and the overall experience had a great vibe and flow to it. To top it all off, one of the staff knew it was my graduation dinner and they brought me out a surprise Mudd Pie dessert in celebration, and I was overwhelmed with joy!The bathroom was clean and smelled amazing, the wait time was non-existent, the staff all made eye contact, smiled, and helped with our every need, and the ocean view was incomparable.

6/22/2020,"Firebaugh, CA","Amazing view. Unfriendly & rude staff. Booked this restaurant when I was there in person for happy hour with my fiancé for 30 people for a post wedding brunch in January. I called to confirm reservation 2 weeks later and they told me that they don't take reservations on Sundays during the time I booked. Weird, right? Because usually you look at the date requested on your calendar to see what day of the week it is. Anyways, after their mistake they agreed to send me a contract and would make accommodations. I was so grateful and glad that they made it right because I had already invited family and friends to attend. Fast forward to COVID, my fiancé called to talk to the reservation / event manager to see if they had any restrictions and ask for details. THEY HUNG UP ON HIM. He called back and they told him that they had cancelled all contracts and that we no longer had a reservation because of the pandemic. I then called the restaurant to confirm what my fiancé had told me and asked for the same person, and Ana who answered the phone immediately HUNG UP on me too. I called the restaurant 5 times before the finally answered! I asked for the manager and asked why they didn't call or email us to let us know that they cancelled our contract. She said they did but they for sure didn't. I asked her to pull up the email and forward it to me and they wouldn't. This just showed me that they lied and they handled the situation wrong. Long story short, there are many other places with great views... and friendly staff. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Do not waste your time booking any special event here. They are far from accommodating and the team has no idea what's going on or what day it is.",1 star rating,Nicala A.
11/11/2018,"North Hollywood, CA","We traveled north from LA for the day to Santa Barbara just to eat, drink and relax. We chose Boathouse because they had a good happy hour on Sundays that offered $2 oysters. We love oysters!Upon arrival they asked where we would like to sit and we waited approx. 30 minutes so we could sot outside and watch the sunset. We were seated and waited a little while before anyone asked to take an order. To our dismay, we found out that they do not serve happy hour where we were seated. No one said anything about restrictions and it did not say anything on their website about any restrictions other than the days and times it is offered.The pics attached are from their website on the happy hour page. It shows the top and bottom of the page, minus the food offerings in the middle. Nowhere does it say anything about the restricted seating for happy hour.They offered to seat us inside instead, but we did not want to wait any longer as we were very hungry. We skipped the oysters even though that's why we came there and ordered the Boathouse Louie Salad with crab and the Steak Frites. Unfortunately, the steak had no flavor and my salad came out with both shrimp and crab instead of all crab as requested.  We ate our meals, had one drink each, and then left.The staff was friendly, but the food could be better. Also, they need to be more clear about their happy hour seating restrictions to prevent disappointment.  Needless to say, we probably won't be back.",3 star rating,Mmphqueen B.
9/20/2020,"Brooklyn, NY","The setting and service were great but it sort of fizzles out from there. Unfortunately the food was subpar. We started with ahi poke lettuce wraps and seared scallops & pork belly. The wraps were the best item of the evening...fresh, good seasoning, perfect size for a starter. The scallops & pork belly had amazing potential but had zero seasoning. The best part of that dish were the scallops because they were cooked perfectly and as such don't really require anything else. For our mains we had the signature seafood pasta and steak frites. The pasta was sooo bland and swimming in sauce. The steak was really tough and again zero flavor. The white wines were over chilled and tasted as the bottles had been open for some time. I'll potentially give the place a 2nd chance simply because the setting like I mentioned was dreamy, but we'll prob stick to the starters & cocktails over entrees & wines.",3 star rating,Michelle B.

Most dishes contain a twist such as my selection of grilled scallops over creamy crab risotto with spicy tomato basil broth. Due to my sensitive palate I requested the broth on the side.  The server was quite accommodating.

Although there was a lot of wait time the food is worth the wait.As for the food we ordered Santa Barbara Omelette, Boathouse Omelette, Eggs Benedict and cured Salmon Plate. Everything tasted good. The boathouse omelette had lobster, shrimps and spinach- a combination I had never tried before. Really tasty and well cooked. My friends who had the cured salmon really enjoyed the salmon in it. The one who had the Santa Barbara omelette was eggitarian and he too felt the dish was quite filling and tasty.Overall it's a great place to be for enjoying the beach view and great food. Must go place in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Arackal T.
12/9/2018,"San Diego, CA","I love this place! It's a beautiful brunch spot right on the beach with the view of the ocean. The parking lot isn't so big so during peak times, it's hard to look for parking. We ordered almost everything on the menu because we couldn't decide what we wanted. I recommend the Boathouse Signature Breakfast, Chowder Fries, French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, Steamed Mussels, and the Calamari. All of our food came pretty fast and they were all very delicious. The only thing that really bothered was the sand that kept flying into our food and water, but it's expected as the restaurant is right on the beach and it was a very windy morning.

10/1/2017,"San Francisco, CA","I just started my new position at work recently, and my co-workers and I came here to celebrate! I could not have gone anywhere else better than Boathouse.The view is gorgeoussss, and the mirrors create the illusion that the restaurant is huge and more sun-soaked than it really is. I recommend coming here around sunset. You're literally on the beach so you can't ask for a better spot than this.For appetizers, the calamari was crispy and crunchy! But, my favorite was probably the crab crakes. The mac and cheese was a little disappointing. I ordered the filet mignon, and it came with a side of buttery mashed potatoes. The meat had excellent quality - very tender.",4 star rating,Jennifer W.
7/11/2018,"Danville, CA","Sunday Brunch! So excited to share our experience at this restaurant! Located on Cliff Drive in beautiful Santa Barbara with sweeping views of the Pacific while you enjoy your meal. Outside patio is definitely the place to take in their ambience with ample seating with large umbrellas. Lots of indoor dining too! But outside is the bomb! Knowledgeable and friendly waiters that serve up an array of the most mouth watering dishes I've seen in a while! Their Grand Seafood Platters from their Raw Bar looked amazing with ample portions of Oysters on the half shell, Mussels and large Shrimp. Their menu is endless with lunch starters of Manila Clams, Fried Calamari, several local fish, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Kobe Beef Burgers, Fish Tacos, Grilled Tofu and Veggie Burgers and House made Chowders just to name a few! And Boathouse special CIOPPINO! Can't wait to come back and sample more of their great food options! Their cocktail menu is out of this world too with their must have signature Shrimp and Bacon Bloody Mary's! Breakfast in a glass!! Crazy! Blew me away! Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch or Dinner, this place ranks tops in all categories for foodies like us from the Bay Area and so worth the trip! Wished we lived closer but Santa Barbara will always be one of our favorite vacation destinations! We were so pleased with our choices for our Breakfast/Brunch! I had their Boathouse Omelette that included Lobster, Shrimp, Spinach and Gruyere Cheese with delicious Breakfast Potatoes and a homemade biscuit with honey! My husband had their large-cut Corned Beef and Hash with two poached eggs and country potatoes that looked and also tasted so fresh with so many great flavors! Good job! Everything was served just at the right temperature, great presentation and delicious to the last bite! First come first served! Popular not only with locals but travelers like us. Prepare to see a crowd of foodies who are in the know so plan ahead! Ok so now you know where you need to go for great food in Santa Barbara! Ample parking with two lots since this is also a popular dog beach with people and dogs coming and going so be patient because it's so worth it!",5 star rating,Barbara N.
5/10/2018,"Sacramento, CA","** I come to Boathouse at Hendry's Beach quite frequently and I feel like some of the servers take advantage of their customer if they order a lot of drinks but only order a few food items, the servers will then add another charge to your receipt. It's happened to us multiple times. **I really think that Boathouse at Hendry's Beach is one of the better restaurants in Santa Barbara with a minimalist charming beachy vibe and a killer view.THE STAFF- The girls that work up front are very standoffish and pretend to be on the phone when you arrive in beach attire. The servers are very affluent but some need to be more educated on the menu and food and also bring in some personality too I feel (a smile and a ""how are you doing today?"" goes a long way). THE FOOD-Their Chowder fries ($7.95) are everything, consisting of Old Bay dusted fries, topped with New England chowder, and chopped bacon, it's the most savory way to start a pleasant meal. I really enjoyed the crispness of the fries with the almost glazed like texture of the chowder that went on top of them.I shared a California eggs Benedict ($13.95), which consisted of ripened avocado, poached eggs, tomatoes, and red onions over a toasted English muffin, topped with citrus hollandaise sauce, and served with breakfast potatoes. The eggs had a nice bite but I felt it was a little bit more salty than I would have liked. It's definitely not an everyday eggs Benedict you would have at any brunch place; the citrus hollandaise sauce definitely made the dish more unique and enjoyable.----------------------------------------------------------------For a day of absolute American cuisine indulgence, with a view that won't quit, i'd definitely wholeheartedly recommend Boathouse to everyone as the better options for restaurants with magnificent views of the Ocean.",4 star rating,Marina B.

We both had the crab cakes and they were sooooo tasty! Portion was huge, we 100% could have shared. Minus one star: Service was sloooooooooooow.  We got our food before we got our drinks!! That should never happen.  Also, after our waiter dropped our food he never checked in on us.  We had to get up and ask for utensils.   Additionally --there was no real appetizers on the menu?? I would love to see some seafood options: oysters, calamari, ceviche.  Overall -great brunch, would recommend.",4 star rating,Elizabeth J.
10/27/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","A trip to the Boathouse at Hendry's is one of our favorite places to take out of town guests. Brunch after a walk on the beach is the perfect Sunday morning. The atmosphere is hectic and busy, service is attentive, and while the food is not out of this world, it is reasonably priced for the quality and the menu has a nice variety of options. Cocktails are good and not too expensive! They don't take online reservations and the staff are hard to get on the phone so we've never managed to get a sunset dinner reservation, but brunch on the weekends is first come first served and for a small party we've never had to wait too long.",4 star rating,Molly W.
4/10/2017,"Buena Park, CA","The appeal to this restaurant is all about the location. Dramatic views of the beach and sounds of the crashing waves while having a drink is what it's all about! I came by on an off peak time on a Sunday and it was still a 30 mins wait. If you want to try to sit sooner, you can try the bar tables, no guarantees though. Aside from the amazing location, the food does stand on a leg of it's own. The lobster Mac and cheese was creamy and had loads of lobster mixed in! Totally worth all the calories! The shrimp tacos are plentiful too! 4 Large succulent shrimp in a corn tortilla with rice and beans! So so good! They have a great specialty cocktail menu with some options like exotic fruity drinks. Our food came out pretty quickly and our server was checking up on us often, even though the bar area was quite busy.Quite a place to have brunch or any meal for that matter. Check it.",4 star rating,Ada J.

The boathouse is RIGHT on the beach, it's a great view!Ryan got a bloody mary, he said he enjoyed which was obvious since he finished in within 10 minutes!We both got benedicts, pork belly and crab cake. What i really liked was that the benedicts did not come on an english muffin, it came on a bed of their breakfast potatoes.

3/27/2017,"Fresno, CA","I really enjoyed my visit here, for a birthday dinner, but the food didn't live up to my expectations.First off, it's an absolutely gorgeous building and setting. I'd made a reservation for indoors at 8pm but wish we'd come earlier to enjoy the sunset. Though it was dark it was a gorgeous evening and we were happy to sit by the beach for a few minutes until our table was ready.Inside, most of the tables sit along the window, and there are a ton of little nautical details. Someone definitely put a lot of thought into this place. The service was good and it's obviously a very well-run operation, but the food was a little underwhelming. We started with a half dozen oysters and were given 3 options for where they came from, so without having any other context we selected the nearest option, from British Columbia. I've never seen oysters so small - they were about the size of my fingertip. They tasted good but there really wasn't much to them.For mains, I got a seafood risotto which included rock crab, scallops and white fish. I don't know if risotto is just served differently in the US than it is in Europe, but I've yet to have a good one - the broth was too wet. However the fish was perfect, and I contented myself with eating all the protein and leaving some room for dessert. My husband ordered the ciuppino which he enjoyed, though said it wasn't the best he'd had (and I've watched him have religious experiences with ciuppino from places like Tattage Grill in San Francisco). So, pretty good, but not putting it over the top.The desserts were actually kind of terrible. I got a creme brulee which was beautifully presented but pretty flavorless and kind of gritty. My husband got a brownie with ice cream which, again, looked good, which was overdone and dry.At some places we would've probably skipped desserts and just been a tad disappointed about the oysters, but it all really compounded by the end. I can see why this place is popular, and it must be particularly stunning in the daytime and at sunset, but we walked away disappointed by the food, particularly as the bill was around $180 before tip. A shame!",3 star rating,Nicola B.

Which after spending the weekend in SB, I really appreciated... as most places you need to use valet or park in a common area parking lot and walk.... which is fine for me as well. But again a nice and easy way to start my Sunday!Once parked we headed over to put our name on the list and was notified about the 1.5hr wait! Wow! Fortunately, we arrived right as a couple was leaving in the bar area.... which is a first come first serve area! Lucky for sure!The views are amazing! It's ON the beach! I could've just stayed there all day long. It was warm on the outside seating patio area with heaters and a glass enclosure. Really any spot out there would be great for views!They were crowded, but the fellow diners and restaurant overall had a great vibe. The bar was full and all tables inside and out, several families were dining for brunch.We shared the lobster and shrimp omelette, a new one for me and delicious! We also had the French toast with berries(which included strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, AND blueberries) all of the good ones!!! Tip:Generous breakfast portion sizes served here, you can definitely share.

1/5/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I am a consumer advocate and write a lot of reviews both good and bad.  I also work in the finance area and have had auto shops as clients and know how they operate their businesses.  I always look at the one star reviews, weeding out the crazy ones, then focus on the issues at hand which tend to be fairly genuine.  I do the same with the 5 star reviews which on sites like this one are quite often made up reviews from friends and family.  That said, I don't recommend this company for repairing your VW, here's why:1-  I came in about a year ago with my 1981 Vanagon and paid them to do a check out of my car.  The biggest item they called out was to replace all the bushings which had already been replaced just over a year prior.  2-  The other item they seriously called out was a rear end CVS boot.  When I brought it in for replacement, they then called me while on the hoist to suggest I replace the other boot since ""they were already down there.""  I went ahead and had them do it just to keep the peace, but regret that decision.  No old part review as well to show what was wrong.  3- The cable broke on my side door and they said they would get the part and call me back.  Never heard from them so I called and left polite messages, three times, and no call back.  I was confused as to why no call back since I had never complained and paid promptly.  After compromising my standards on item 2, I decided to check into them further.  Cool thing is that the VW Vanagon community is a tight network and people are willing to share info.  What I've learned and from my experience with Cory is that they do have good mechanics, but their business practice appears to me to be short on sound business ethics.  If you are in the group of anal retentive VW Vanagon owners and don't mind opening your pocket book and letting them repair stuff that doesn't need repairing, they are the place for you.  If you are in my category, love your car and want to take care of it, and use and drive it a lot, but don't want to fix stuff that isn't broken or doesn't need it, you might want to shop around.  It's hard to find an honest, competent and ethical VW mechanic in SB.  There are a small handful if you ask around, but this shop is not one of them.",1 star rating,Steve W.

4/18/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Although we came here on an overcast, miserably cold day, the Boathouse at Hendry's Beach was still a gorgeous place to sit, eat and gaze out at the ocean... from the comfort of an inside table of course.It was Good Friday so the restaurant was understandably packed out with bookings running until close. The hostess was extremely helpful and offered us an incredible table as long as we made our stay under an hour and a half.Once we were all seated it did take some time for the waiter to acknowledge our table, about ten minutes or so, but that gave us plenty of time to look at the wine list. We grabbed a bottle of the house Cabernet and it was extremely tasty!I was allergic to the vast majority of the menu so settled on the Ahi Club sandwich, it was very tasty and I loved the sauces they used! The fries were also to die for, I just couldn't stop eating them!I wish that we'd have had more time here and that the service hadn't been as slow because we definitely would have ordered a few more drinks and enjoyed the view a little while longer.

It would have been better if they brought the starter first, let us eat that. Then bring the main dish. The crab cakes were not hot, so I'm sure they sat there until the cippinio was ready.We biked along the coast then walked all over the Douglas  preserve.  After lunch we walked and walked along the ocean right at the beach from this restaurant.

You might see this place and assume they take a lazy approach to food and drink because they can rely solely on their location to attract a crowd -- it really is stunning -- but you'd be wrong. We love their breakfast menu (solid chilaquiles, great eggs Benedict, etc.) and they make a mean Bloody Mary. So good. The only thing keeping my review from 5-star status is the lack of a dog-friendly patio.

The location is right on the beach and the layout inside and outside of the place is magnificent. You can come dressed up or super casual, very comfortable setting. Service: 4/5 the hostess was a little rude when I went up to put my name in, but they were attentive. Our server, Tomas, was nothing short of AMAZING! He spoke Spanish fluently and made my grandparents feel very comfortable and happy. He displayed a lot of patience and accommodation for our big party of 8. It was my cousins bday lunch so he treated us to some mocha flavored ice cream with raspberry and Oreo cookie crumbles. He came to check on us very often and was very friendly and helpful in choosing what to order! I appreciated his honestly and sincerity. Food: 4/5 Everyone at the table really enjoyed the sea food, but for those who ordered the burger said it was a little dry and not very flavorful, but still an okay burger. So I recommend you get seafood! We wanted brunch but they ended it at 1. Chowder fries are a MUST TRY! I'll attach a photo below. I also got the lobster mac and cheese, so cheesy and the lobster substance was great. My aunt ordered the seafood pasta and I've got to say.. WOW!! So tasteful, the sauce was perfect taste and texture and the fish didn't overpower it at all. And the garlic bread... yum!

We ordered ahead of time but still had to wait in line with people actively ordering drinks just to pick up our food and pay. The line took about 25 minutes to get through and our food was sitting on the bar, cold and soggy. The issue here is that there is one line for pickup and togo drinks with only one person taking orders for one group at a time. Also noted, they forgot one of our orders and I was unimpressed by their customer service when we called to correct their mistake. I was told I would be put on hold but instead heard the entire conversation between the host and what seemed to be a manager which was very rude quite frankly and extremely unprofessional. I would never recommend take out from this restaurant if you're something organized and quick as it was the exact opposite.

He came and pointed to the ocean and literally we saw a whale jump out the water and then we saw dolphins !!!!!! YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT! Definitely coming back EVERYTIME we visit grandma !,5 star rating,Cristina C.

8/2/2018,"Louisville, KY","I'm giving it a 5 star rating even though I didn't care for my ceviche.  EVERYTHING else was so fantastic from the pre-meal ""Step in the Right Direction"" vodka cocktail, the awesome beach view, the friendly service, the clean restrooms and the yummy meals everyone else enjoyed.  So what if I make a better ceviche at home, the experience at the Boathouse will bring me back to this little gem the next time I'm visiting family and friends in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Lora C.
7/8/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is literally steps away from the beach with a small crowd.  The beach is fairly small, but is dog friendly.  So after a day on the beach with your pooch, leave them outside in the dog area and have yourself a drink or dinner.  The bar area and outdoor seating has happy hour and the interior dining area is more fine dining.  Try the blood orange margarita as it's their speciality.  Service is great and I am definitely coming back here.",4 star rating,Darylynn D.
9/5/2020,"Little Italy, San Diego, CA","Great view and good drinks, but the hostess was rude and very deceiving with the wait time considering they're not taking reservations. We were told an hour and 2 hours later we finally get a call that a table is ready. Meanwhile an hour into waiting the tables that were seated when we got there still had no food on their table....extremely dissappointing and deceiving service considering the extreme circumstances we are all under. Herds of people were waiting outside for hours waiting to be seated. Just be honest about the wait time and step your service up to accomodate the fact that you are not taking reservations.",2 star rating,Gabriela P.

9/26/2020,"Lombard, IL",My husband and I stopped here to see the beach not even knowing this restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the area. We're almost didn't eat here because there was a 2 hour wait. Then we saw the take out sign. We ordered at the bar. The food was done very quickly. I had the shrimp tacos. They were filled to the brim with shrimp so much so that I had to eat them with a fork as they kept falling out. The sauce was perfectly spicy. My husband had the ahi tuna club. It was fabulous! The wasabi aoili was the best thing we tasted all day. The tuna was fresh. The sourdough was perfectly crispy. The only reason this does not receive 5 stars is because the $13 mojito was watered down and the mint wasn't even muddled. Eat here but go somewhere else for your drinks.,4 star rating,Terri R.
6/12/2019,"Ventura, CA","Other than the ambiance (on the beach) the food was sub par. I was with friends. I ordered ceviche, calamari, and shrimp cocktail. Ceviche is made with rock crab and so you should expect a more crabbie taste. I think it kinda ruins the flavor a bit because there wasn't enough lime, cilantro, jalapeño or any of the other things that make a ceviche great. It was served on a bed of cabbage witching makes it difficult to get to ALL of the ceviche. The calamari was limp and only rings. No crunch to it at all.  The shrimp cocktail had nice size shrimp, but presentation was lousy and untraditional, it was NOT delivered in a cocktail glass. For all dishes the lemon wedges were hard as a rock with zero juice. The server was prompt and courteous when I flagged her down for water, orders, bill, etc. in her defense she was very busy. No benies for check-ins.",3 star rating,Wendy B.

9/6/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I called in an order of oysters for takeout and the lady who took my order was very sweet and helpful. However, when I pulled up to the parking lot, the main lot was closed off. There was a line of cars that wasn't moving and that I hadn't been told about. I called the restaurant regarding how to get my food, just to have my question repeatedly interrupted and told- they know there's a problem with their parking lot, it's not their fault/ problem, be told that I will be able to get my food in the end, and then be hung up on! And they were right! I finally got my order of 1/2 dozen oysters. In addition I got to sit in a parking lot for 30 minutes waiting to park so I can eventually pick up my order (which would take about 5 minutes at any other restaurant). At home I opened the box and found that all of the ice was melted (bc the lot isn't their problem and apparently neither is taking care of the customer's order until they are able to pick it up). The water had gone through the box flooding the bag and the oysters. (I'm not the best at preparing oysters but I'm pretty sure the they aren't supposed to be drowning in fresh water when served). As a local- I will not be returning to or recommending this restaurant.",1 star rating,Katie W.

When we reached here, there was a longggg waiting, but you can order stuff to go and eat right there on the beach, which was good :)The bartenders are knowledgeable and suggest great things to go with your food.All in all, a great place to remember and revisit.",5 star rating,Subha J.
6/25/2019,"Santa Barbara Downtown, Santa Barbara, CA","The location of this restaurant is obviously pretty solid. Ambience, view, music, blah blah, all solid. So what do you order???? So I came here around brunch, and ordered the crab cakes. Never had crab cakes before so I didn't really have anything to compare it to, but it was good; you won't be disappointed if you order this. I also tried their breakfast burrito and it was good I guess too, if you don't eat pork or somethin, you can actually sub it out for a different meat. Also, even if you come during their breakfast hours you can ask for their lunch menu and you can order appetizers off it, but you can't order any entrees. So I got the Manila clams, and they were pretty whatever. Just straight up clams, like what did I expect haha.So overall, I give this place 4 stars. Good vibe and all, but the food is just whatever. It's good don't get me wrong, but the hefty price you pay is for everything else.",4 star rating,Sheck W.

Like being born pretty, being plunked on the edge of the Pacific is (IMHO) about as good as it gets. We arrived just after sunset, and the place was ablaze with tiny white lights crawling up palm trees, and a fire lit the patio along with a host of heaters. The atmosphere was festive; people meeting up after a hard day's work.We ate inside where the ocean theme was dominant. Very cool and chic. My food was perfect. Absolutely perfect.

Imagine, all your seafood is in a nice tomatoeish broth and you are going to put your hands in the dish to crack that claw?! Come on...IF you are on a date, do not get this...RESULT: 2 napkins used to wipe my hands and the claw half eaten as it was not that good.

Met a cool dog outside too, HUGE bonus. Because who doesn't like meeting a nice little buddy while branching with some friends?Came back to SB for a college reunion trip, and had brunch here one of the days. There was about 10 of us, so we waited close to 45 minutes for a table. No biggie, we hung out on the beach and watched the dogs run around.  Started of with their signature Bloody Mary. Boy, was it bloody brilliant! So good!Followed by a dozen oysters for the table and calamari. The oysters were fresh and the calamari was nice and crispy. The chilaquiles were really good! Portion size was pretty big so I wasn't able to finish it. Some of our other guests ordered the eggs Benedict, which I was told was amazing. Would definitely order.

1/12/2018,"Chandler, AZ","My absolute favorite place for brunch.  The view is spectacular... this beach is one of my favorites in Santa Barbara, it was where I began my love affair with the city... but mostly because I am slightly obsessed with all of the roaming puppers on the beach.  Anyway, it's usually pretty packed... you might have to wait a bit for a good spot but it's worth the wait.  When I would drink, their bloody mary was my hands down favorite... they serve it dawned with a freaking shrimp.  Game over.  Brunch doesn't get better than that.  In my keto-friendly life, carbs are the enemy so I usually opt for the pork belly benedict, substitute veggies for the potatoes.  It's an annoying request so I really appreciate them dealing with my low carb ways.  Everything else on the menu looks delicious & everyone I bring here raves about their food, so I feel like it's not just about the view.Service is a little hit or miss for me.  I've had some above & beyond experiences and some pretty mediocre ones as well, but mostly good.  This definitely isn't an every day spot for me.  I end up here for something special.  Parking is pretty horrible so come early, come on a weekday or visit when it's cloudy.  And make sure you walk the beach afterward!  Leave your shoes at the stairs & be on pupper watch.  The views are so gorgeous... I would take this beach over Butterfly Beach any day.",5 star rating,Lindsey P.

French Fries w/Old Bay: stale, chewy, not fresh. Maybe we had a bad batch...but even with ketchup and Old Bay they weren't good. Wasn't worth sending them back for $7 and Lisa was so nice. But if this is the norm for the fries, then don't bother ordering! Nothing spectacular.The best part about this place, other than Lisa, was the view. We were lucky it wasn't crowded and it was post rain, so it was clean, sunny, nice. The drinks were excellent, so was the service and the view.

9/14/2019,"West Covina, CA","We came to Santa Barbara for our 4 year anniversary and I found this place on yelp. We decided to give it a shot because we were craving seafood. First off, the parking takes a while because it's the same area where everyone parks to go to the beach. If you have kids and you're wondering if you should come here it's ok to bring kids, I have two. I had my 6 month old in a stroller so the only thing is you have to leave the stroller in the front, it will be in the way. Some of the booths have a great view, since it's beachfront and with that being said the prices are reasonable. However the experience for us wasn't the best especially for celebrating an anniversary. It's a bit loud in there and super busy. We came around 5 on a Saturday. Oh and if you're wondering, Kids menu is about 11.95 I believe. I didn't like that the place felt a little warm and until I went to the bathroom to change my baby I felt the AC toward the back tables closest to the bathroom. So that's something to consider. They have the little koala station to comfortably change your baby. But it's only in the women's restroom lol. If your baby is small like mine careful with the air dryer for your hands. That thing is beyond noisy and it scared the hell out of my kiddo, he even cried. I did mention it's busy so don't expect to get your food quick. We waited quite a while for ours and the appetizers took a while too. When I finally got my food I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad but it surely wasn't something I would go back to. Sucks because we came from so far (Los Angeles) and I was expecting a different experience. I ordered the sea bass dish with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was just alright. I never really put salt on my food but I had to On this one. My husband ordered the mahi mahi and also it was alright. From the appetizer area we ordered the calamari, which I feel you can never go wrong with. Their dipping sauce was amazing. The ceviche on the other hand was not my favorite. It wasn't the texture I expected and it was a bit dry. I also ordered a Michelada and it was not good at all. I left more than half. The rim of tajin was not even all there and it just didn't look like one (i order these all the time so I can tell when it's a good one). We were contemplating trying their breakfast tomorrow morning since we leave back for LA, but I might pass and give another spot a try and hope for a better experience than this one. The server was great, I just wasn't impressed with the food, and I'm not a picky eater quite frankly.",2 star rating,Veronica L.

This place has ocean views and is more casual than I had expected.  You will absolutely need reservations and parking could be an issue. Even though there is a big lot, parking can be tough since most people are at the beach (which is dog friendly).  I made an 8:30 p.m. reservation (it was all they had) and we just spent the time waiting on the beach. I drank a blood orange margarita ($10) but actually preferred my boyfriend's Moscow Mule.  We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer which was delicious.  I ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon ($29) and my boyfriend had the sea bass. We both loved our dishes and thought they were quite reasonably priced.  For dessert we split some chocolate mud pie type dish ($8), which was alright but not memorable. I would definitely come back here.

We were helped in just a few short minutes and led to a table with a great view of the ocean.  Our server was very friendly and extremely responsive. The view is something that really sets this location apart from others. Eating a delicious meal while peacefully watching the waves crash on the shore was such a killer way to begin the weekend.  My fiancé and I had a really great time not only watching the waves, however the restaurant is located right next to the dog section of the beach.  Tons of amazingly cute dogs of all sizes were running around the sand with the owners and this sight was just to die for. If you are a dog lover, you will DEFINITELY enjoy this.The food was equally as amazing.  We each ordered omelets and I was very happy with my choice.  The food was cooked quickly and it was very savory.  My omelet was loaded with tasty vegetables, just the way I like it! They also had very good mimosas! I started drinking mine before having food, and I have to admit it was making me a little tipsy.

2/15/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","This place does well because of the location. Food and service another story.Last night I met some friends at Boathouse. They had all been there a while so I asked the waitress if I could please have my own check. She agreed.I ordered a New York Steak and a glass of Chardonnay. The steak was very tough and no flavor whatsoever. Most of the people at our cocktail table left and there was just me and one other person who also ordered food and drinks.I gave my server my credit card thinking she would just charge me for mine. But when I looked at the receipt, she had added on the other persons to my bill also . The bill was almost $100. I went to find the server and said ""you added on the other persons food and drinks after I asked for my own check"" she looked at me in a strange way and said really sarcastically ""Oh sorry"" practically rolling her eyes. I was shocked.Then she came back to the table and presented me my new bill and said she had comped the other person at the table giving her free food and drinks. Because ""they like her""It was so catty and inappropriate. But they were ready to charge me.Tom and Adam White I think you need to check on that.

7/26/2020,"Ventura, CA","My hubby and I visited the Boathouse in Santa Barbara for lunch. Although the location is superb, but their food and drinks sucks. For the drinks: they only have a set menu, if you ask them to put together, they don't have it; they won't make it, you have to choose one of their menu drinks. My hubby ordered the lobster roll, on the menu, it says there's mayo. The roll comes with no mayo whatsoever, the lobster is chewy as if it's previously frozen! tastes awful. I ordered cosmopolitan, it didn't taste like it and it tasted awful. My hubby ordered a regular margarita, it tasted awful. For appetizer, we ordered chips and salsa, they gave us only chips and salsa and charged for the whole deal!

Bathroom lineup is weird.  Locals and sorry we won't come back until service and food improves. Maybe we'll try again for a simple breakfast when we're desperate for nice ocean view on a weekday.Also got a Suprise extra charge on a Caesars for anchovies that wasn't mentioned.Maybe just enjoy the beach walk but be prepared for  lots of dogs and loads of tar on your feet or shoes after.

We were sat immediately and the service was top notch.  We had drinks in a matter of minutes from sitting down and had the Mac and cheese and clam chowder for appetizers.   The macs was so outstanding it could be made into a meal all on its own.  Then we had the sea bass and the bacon wrapped filet.  So juicy and tender.  Then banana foster, key lime pie and the raspberry  Cheesecake for desert.  Yes we took two of them home.  It was all so very worth the money.  A must if you enjoy wonderfully tasting foods.    Would recommend and defiantly go there again ! Thank you !",5 star rating,Bob R.

11/12/2017,"Sacramento, CA","The location is one of the best. Situated literally on the beach, there is no bad time to come and no seat is without a view. For dinner, its one of the best restaurants to catch the sunset. The mirrors on the back wall make it so that every seat can catch the view. In the evening, the restaurant is filled with glow of the setting sun. It's also great you can watch the families laughing by the beach, and the kids are running through the waves, adding to the overall joy of the dinning experience. For brunch, you can't come here without ordering the Signature Bloody Mary. If ordering oysters, I recommend the blue point oysters (I think that was the name but 2 bloody mary's in makes it harder to remember). The wait without a reservation was 30 minutes for brunch, but went by fast over a walk on the beach.",4 star rating,Dale D.

We read a lot about their famous bloody mary so decided to try it out, and boy! It was amazing! They had added olives, a strip of bacon and a shrimp on it and it was a really good bloody mary!My husband ordered the boathouse mule and he liked it too. We were blown away by the crab cakes, they were just out of the world. The eggs benedict was also very delicious. We got a side of sausages which were awesome too, overall perfect food. I ordered half stack of chocolate chip pancakes which was good too. The view from the tables was of the ocean! We could see a kite surfer too.

Food is .... okay. Still delivers but I've tried better clam chowder. The rock fish ceviche was very fresh and good, not excellent because it needed a little bit more flavor. Needs a tiny bit more tanginess and spice in the ceviche. Over all very good in taste and service.",4 star rating,Clara T.
11/14/2016,"Chatsworth, CA","After hiking the cliff  our group made a reservation for lunch, then we walked the beach. When we came back to the restaurant they told us to wait another 25 minutes or so. We waited pretty long to get to seat. Like the other reviewer wrote___the food was good but we were just so irritated at how inefficient they are at seating people! There were always empty tables and the hostess would just chat with people .That was our case also. Boathouse located right by the beach, so the view is great. Food was a bit heavy side, but really good. I had kale salad with grilled shrimps. The dressing on kale was super, tasty shrimps alone on salad costed $7! Quite expensive lunch I had.  Service personal was super friendly and fast.Overall a good place to eat by the beach.",4 star rating,Jean Y.

10/7/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Whether you're a local or a tourist- this place is amazing and definitely worth a visit! The food is amazing but the greatest attraction is the view! You're sitting RIGHT on the beach. Not to mention- it's also nice to take a walk after your meal to work off that food.My favorite time to come here is during brunch- I love the eggs Benedict and never forget to order a mimosa (they're pretty generous with the champagne). If you're coming for dinner, I'd recommend the filet mignon or mahi mahi if you're a fish person. They also have vegetarian options (tofu that's actually super yummy) if you or someone in your party doesn't eat meat. The service is great- the waiters are extremely kind and attentive. If you're able, request a table outside- the view as well as the sea breeze and ocean air will make your experience all that much better!",5 star rating,Jordan T.

Not only will you get delicious food and great service, but you'll also enjoy a nice atmosphere, beautiful ocean view and cute dogs nearby because of the dog beach! The bartender was super nice and friendly, which should certainly be more common than it is, but nonetheless it was a great start to our visit. One of my friends ordered the blood orange margarita and another ordered coffee and both were delightful! For brunch we ordered family style and all shared... we got the French Toast with berries, Chilaquiles, Pancakes with Banana and Chocolate Chips on top, Boathouse Omelette (Lobster/Shrimp Omelette) and the Boathouse Signature Breakfast. Let me tell you they were all delectable!! My favorite was the chilaquiles. It had so much flavor, the chips were the perfect consistency, the egg was cooked perfectly and the avocado and cream made a great touch. I am also a huge pancake person and these fluffy delights did not disappoint! The chocolate chips were melty and added a wonderful touch! The signature breakfast (crab cakes under poached eggs topped with chipotle hollandaise served with potatoes) was yummy too and although I'm not really a crab-cake  person it was so flavorful and fresh, a great choice indeed! Our server was also really friendly and overall it was an awesome experience. Also, the prices were very reasonable! I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in SB!",5 star rating,Angela W.

Boathouse has everything you would want for a special evening - a classy (yet by no means stuffy) restaurant with ocean and coastal views, great seafood selection (sea bass was excellent, and the lobster was incredible per my husband), fresh salads and appetizers (the wedge salad in particular was one of the best Cobb/wedge salads I've had, ever), impressive wine and house cocktail list, and friendly, attentive service.The outside ambiance was beautiful - well-lit, comfortable, and there was clear attention to detail on things like the outside fireplace and bar.

8/28/2017,"Simi Valley, CA","This may be my new favorite beach restaurant! It has such a better vibe than the restaurants on the beach near Los Angeles. This cute place is located right on a cool beach with an area for dogs to run so there was plenty of awesome pooch and people watching. And everyone seems so much more relaxed and happy here. First, lots of puppies out front of the restaurant in their puppy area so that's a GREAT way to be greeted anywhere! There was water in a plastic bowl so it wouldn't get too hot - BUT, they really need more SHADE for our furry friends here in this waiting spot! The hostess' were all very nice and knowledgeable. We were seated outside on the patio very quickly for a Sunday afternoon. Our drink order was fast and our server was very knowledgeable on the local beers that they offered - and I mean what they tasted like and not just what the bottle label looked like. It was great to have his expert opinion! The Honeycomb Mojito was just okay though - it came with one of those honey straws but didn't really taste like honey once the straw was added. We pretty much opted for one of everything on the menu LOL! The CHOWDER FRIES were a must! Seasoned skinny fries (crisp on the outside and soft on the inside) were drenched in Clam Chowder and sprinkled with bacon bits on top - I am seriously addicted to these now. I dreamed about them over and over last night.Another stellar option was the pulled pork grilled cheese with grilled Shisito peppers and dipped in Chipolte aioli sauce. Y.U.M. We also tried the Lobster Truffle Mac-N-Cheese - goodness in every bite and lots of sauce and lobsta' chunks. And the Wedge Salad was a surprise not only because they weren't stingy with the toppings but there was a hint of garlic in the freshly made bleu cheese dressing - great addition! Needless to say, we opted for a stroll on the beach rather than dessert ;-) We will most definitely be back again soon! And because the parking lot is shared with the beach access parking, bring your patience and a smile with you as you loop around a couple of times for vacant parking. Good thing is - people are always coming and going here, and there seems to be more parking available as the sun goes down.",5 star rating,Sunny R.

10/23/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","This place is definitely one of those places that you go for the view, atmosphere, or just as a convenience of around beach area, even though I will say food was better than good.  Even though we were there mostly for drinks we did end up eating some small bite.  Teenagers did have breakfast for lunch, which was great for them.  Not many places will keep the breakfast menu.  We arrived around 1:30 thinking lunch crowd would have lessen, we were wrong we did have to wait about 15 minutes (party of 6) but when we arriv d to our table only 5 place setting were set up.  The busboy/ waiter was able to grab another chair, but was a bit awkward waiting while they set up.  After that little mishap we got our menus, friendly waiter came took our drink order, his suggestion was appreciated, I did end up ordering that drink and it was awesome.  Shortly after we got our food order, I had the ceviche, sitting on top of a small tostada surrounded by chips.  I will say it still had a bit of a fish smell, and towards the end of it I found skin of an onion in it.  At first I though it was a plastic, but when I took it out of my mouth realized it was the onion skin.  Prep people would need to be extremely careful about making sure no such things are left behind.  Service was fairly good, since it was a busy time.  Kids did end up getting refill on their drinks, and waiter was on topOf that.

I usually like red sauce over verde but the verde sauce here might have changed my mind. It had bits of pork mixed in with the sauce too which made it that much better. Drinks were strong!

I got the pan seared scallops which were pretty good but the tomato sauce overpowered all the other good flavors in the risotto. Not a bad place considering the location.",3 star rating,Nelly M.

8/26/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","We went here for dinner tonight to celebrate, but so many upsetting things happened that I can't even begin to gather my thoughts to write a full review.  I will probably edit this again later, but I can start by saying that we probably will not be returning anytime soon, if ever. Based on other reviews and photos, I expected a high end dinner.  What I got was disappointing, in comparison.  If this wasn't on the beach, this would be better classified as a locals hang out and dive bar.  It is surprisingly small inside and if you're not sitting at the window, don't expect any view of the beach.The hostess station was not very inviting.  I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.  And we were told we could be seated right away but then were told to awkwardly wait next to the fire pit until another hostess could seat us.  Our two year old daughter was with us.  The hostess asked me if we wanted a child's menu.  Yes.  She is going to eat.  Well $12 for a kids meal is overpriced so nevermind.  She ended up getting a cup of chowder and eating from our plates.  We get seated at the end of the bar and when I asked if we could sit at another empty table nearby, the hostess flippantly said no, those are for reservations.  Rude.  Can I also point out that a spaghetti strap tank top is not appropriate hostess attire?  It wasn't even hot out.  It was in the low 70s.   Also, another waiter was wearing a gray hoodie over his uniform.  Also, not acceptable.  Where we were seated wasn't preferred because it turned into the bro hangout area for the waiters while they were waiting for their drinks to be made by the bartenders.  I don't recommend ordering drinks from the bar either.  It was dirty.  There was trash, dropped ice and a broken glass on the floor so, I can't imagine that the prep area was clean.  The bartenders kept reaching over each other for everything -- bottles, garnish and the register.The waiter quickly managed to get on my nerves.  Do I want anything other than water?  No I guess not because I don't know what else you have.  Coke products?  Pepsi products?  No idea.  He didn't even bother to try to up-sell us on cocktails.  And no for the fourth time, I'm not ready to order, but you can bring me bread.  If I hadn't driven around endlessly to find parking, and thought I could make it to another restaurant without my blood sugar level dropping through the floor I would have left by this point.  Honestly, I never walk out of restaurants.  I should have though.  I wouldn't have saved myself a ton of money and from the trouble of eating below mediocre, overpriced, over-cooked seafood.The rest of the meal didn't get much better.  Don't order the Cioppino.  You'll be disappointed.  EVERY piece of fish was overcooked and rubbery.  The shrimp was also overcooked, but sort of edible.  The shellfish was adhered to the shells, if not missing entirely.  The shell was there, the inside was not.  The broth was decently flavored but the waiter said it had a touch of spice.  Where? The husband said his scallops were good.  Not the best he's ever had but descent.  Not fresh either, kind of seafood-y (so probably from the freezer).  From what I tasted, it was much better than the cioppino.The dessert menu didn't have anything impressive so we skipped it.  Went to State Street for ice cream instead.",2 star rating,Tomoye N.

I ordered the Boathouse Signature Breakfast which was snow and rock crab cakes under poached eggs with a chipotle hollandaise. On the side, served with avocado, salsa, and breakfast potatoes. The freshness of the crab really stood out. I'm a sucker for anything chipotle, so the creaminess of the mayo with the crab and poached eggs worked really well together.

6/14/2017,"Newark, NJ","Took the man up to SB for a romantic getaway and was hoping this would be the perfect romantic brunch for two before heading back to Orange County, working six days a week, and the start of summer school, but...1) Our waiter made us feel very uncomfortable with his ""I don't want to be here"" attitude as he spoke to us with that irritable, ""What do you want,"" voice. The bf and I both work in the hospitality industry so we know that look and that feeling, but don't take it out on the guests.2) The Pork Belly Benedict's pork belly was very dry and my egg was undercooked. The Corned Beef Hash was more like Beef Potato Chunks for stew. It gave my bf a stomach ache.The busser was much more hospitable than our waiter. He was very humble and very polite - even apologized when he didn't have to when we ran out of cream. Cute. We gave him part of our waiter's tip.

The bar scene can be fun too.  This review is regards to the food only and based on suitability for people who don't eat animal products. A tough call perhaps - but as more people are waking up to the cruelty and sustainability and health issues with animal products, let's have a few options for those who opt out.There are two options: a tofu asian inspired dish which I don't think I have tried (at a beach cafe?), and for lunch a mandarin salad, you can request no goat's cheese. It tastes fine, mostly lettuce, not satisfying as a meal and probably cost $20 with tax and tip. I love this locale, let's get a few plant-based options so us those who don't eat animal products can join the fun and not have to eat elsewhere.",2 star rating,Beth P.
7/29/2015,"San Diego, CA","Hunger makes me cranky and full day of conf calls and site visits without eating lunch brought out my worst.  I first enjoyed downtown SB and thought of eating around State St.  It seemed too touristy and busy.  I wanted a place more mellow to nicely slow down the tempo.Glad to have stuck with original plan to go to the Boathouse.  Coming during weekday scored big; parking was a breeze and right in front.  Yes it's right ON the beach and you will feel right at home.  Mostly locals but overheard tourists from NYC (been running into a few since I moved to CA).  The atmosphere is absolutely casual and welcoming, not pretentious as experienced  back in Montecito earlier.  The staff is so welcoming and even though mad busy the staff was the sweetest and accommodating.  I could've gotten a seat immediately behind the hostess but being no view I opted to first try the bar (full) and then asked if possible to have a window seat inside.  It was 30-45 min wait but didn't feel like it; walked the beach, grabbed a strawberry jalapeño cocktail, watched the kitchen and before I knew it I was seated.  My waiter changed to Elias who came around just enough and had time to make small chat.  I ordered ahi tuna poke w lettuce cups, tasted light, yummy and well-presented.  The main entree was local sea bass.  Now at first glance portion looks small but the flavors were explosive!! The fish itself slightly too well done for me but still loved it.    The spinach, asparagus and lemon saffron sauce was cosmic!! and the best part HAD to be the truffle mashed potatoes - slightly chunky which I prefer and if I could I'd have ordered more of them!!Thank you Boathouse for the best way to end a long day!!",5 star rating,Fong L.

5/9/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Virus is causing a lot of anxiety & people are acting out more and more-including my self. I will own it. Loneliness My concern is that while I was in line to distancing  w/ face protection...maybe not the best kind...my mask had gotten wet-so I used a scarf. It was all I had and many do the same.My PTSD is flagging as more & more people are coming to Santa Barbara from cities where beaches and parks...places of Social Community..are on lock down as a result of HIGH Numbers of Reported Cases. I live in Santa Barbara. My family moved here in 1948. I have been on Social Distance and Self Q for 60 days. So when I saw 5 bare faces...huddled at the bar...I felt deep concern & disregard. There is a very clear sign at the entrance-""Please wear a face mask & practice distance. People that do not clearly care need reminding. I tried to talk to  the Manager and he was immediately defensive & rather aggressive. He kept insulting me. He was not shy in his feeling toward me. He repeated insulting words over & over. I tried to tell him my work is in the community & related to the Public Health & Safety. Again doubt & insults I work as an Indy Contractor in Media,Marketing and Fundraising. I am not a Dr or Gov't official. I have no power. I tried to apologize-I realize he is under pressure &my guess is having a hard time. My PTSD got triggered ( Mine is Fight-so I shut down.I try to help. The Senior Gen Pop & At Risk pop are my focus. I saw many people with no shoes and no masks-it is a Valid Concern. My intention was simply to remind him. But he took offense. I was raised in the restaurant business. I get the Daily Fears local businesses are experiencing. A friend officially closed his restaurant Thursday. I want businesses and beaches to stay open. I have suggested carding people at the gate...at least while we wait for Testing, Results & Tracing. I was tested- I will know Sunday. My son is working to keep a restaurant open.He is taking a beating. Acting Out & a Lack Concern for the Community is hard felt. My feeling is that is ""If you cannot follow the rules...you will be reminded"". Cities with High Numbers Of Reported Cases are Ticketing. Parks Rec was on the beach over the weekend & as a Concerned Citizen- I would like to see their presence daily. I honestly do not want forced Closures or Marshall Law.If we could each just follow decent common sense. Remind each other as needed. People are Emotional & Anxious. Me too. We would do better to help each other rather than Bully or Lash Out. I know I am not acting normally. I am under pressure, keeping a 1099 business going. I am not young & -I suffer from complicated challenges. There is no bail out for me. My focus is for firstly my son...his health & well being. We I got tested & I asked the nurse..""what happens if it is positive. Her reply was startling...""nothing"" she replied. ""If you test positive-Contact your Dr. If A Symptomatic...get treated for symptoms.That is all we know right now. I love the Boathouse-they are doing more right than many places. Friday was in fact a weird day. Anxious form the test & a gothically foggy day.People drinking from glass containers on the beach.No leashes etc.Triggering my flags. I feel helpless-not hopeless. I find hope at the beach & I want to keep that hope alive. I am dealing with Grief from deep loss.Loss of Family all at once. I talk to people-more & more I hear about the experience of Grief. Of not ever having this much time off-how to pay for life with nothing coming in.I think we are all experiencing different levels of fear & anxiety.The fear that comes from feeling helpless & lonely. My Son is all I have left. I am doing things like writing my Will.Making an After Life Plan.After losing so much family, a nasty breakup & the loss of a family home - I am grieving. It has been a challenge. My eyesight is now changing. Now categorized as blind. This news has hit me pretty hard. Though I know I am fortunate in so . Almost rediculously lucky. I feel I do not deserve it. I know & daily see people suffering terribly & in visible pain. Mother's Day hits me hard. I am a solo parent & during my pregnancy I was a victim of Aggressive & Threatening Oppression from my sons father. My 1st Mothers day was simply forgotten.My son is being so kind. He sadly knows how I have hurt. People can say they love you & still be extremely dangerous. I am working through it. Kindness will heal. Good food at the Boathouse. Beach walks.

It was pale yellow and dry. Arg. It looked like they cut the raw scallops into 3's to save some money too. Rude. I'd skip this unless you know it's fresh.x Steamed Mussels - I order either clams or mussels if I ever see it on a menu, and these ones were actually ok. I liked the cioppino broth.x Shrimp Tacos - The menu said it was 6 large butterfly shrimps, but they were not large at all! They were like baby shrimps. They overdid it with the mayo sauce too that killed the tacos. I wish I ordered the fish tacos!!I also tried my friends chowder fries which were yummy.

The Sunday brunch is great just expect to have a 1 hour wait... the wait is worth it!There are only a few location where you can spend a day at the beach and also have a great spot for food and drinks. This is a great family and date spot and I'll bet the sunsets are amazing here. We stopped in on a Sunday at 12 and had a 1 hour wait but our table gave us the best view of the ocean - I had the Ahi Tuna club and wife had the French toast with eggs and sausage -the food was great. I would have opted for the eggs Benedict but was already enjoying a cold brew so breakfast was out. I have no doubt that dish was great based on what I saw.

4/15/2015,"Austin, TX","If you can stand the wait on a Sunday for brunch on a sun shiny day without wanting to dabble in cannibalism (eating off someone's limb out of sheer hanger), then Boathouse is a nice retreat from the more populated area of SB. To help curb your insatiable appetite while waiting for a table, get yourself a Bloody Mary (the one with the fatty meets crispy bacon strip and shrimp). It's the perfect way to tide you over for an hour and if you can snag a seat at either side of the bar, then you'll be in heaven.When you finally do get a seat and order, be prepared for the food to come out quick. The kitchen does a phenomenal job of firing out the dishes. The Huevos Hope Ranch was a stellar dish (two fried eggs, crispy tortilla, black beans, avocado, sour cream, queso fresco & Boathouse breakfast potatoes). It was a good lookin' one, too. I also ordered the French toast as an amuse bouche, but would prob skip this next time as there wasn't anything spectacular about it.If you opt to sit outside and the sun is a blazin' and you volunteer yourself for the shadeless seat because you think the brisk SB ocean breeze will cool you down, you will very much regret that decision about 15-30 minutes in. I was definitely feeling the heat half way through my meal and there was nothing the Blood Orange Margarita could do about it...unless I chose to pour it on my body instead of in my mouth, but that didn't seem like the classy Sunday brunch thing to do.",3 star rating,Katie B.

12/24/2018,"Beaverton, OR","Such an amazing meal and location! We had oysters, which were super fresh and tasty. We also had the Ahi Poke, which was AMAZING! Then we had the clam chowder - one of the best I've ever had. And in addition to that, the lobster truffle Mac and Cheese. The truffle was not overpowering, the dish was very unique and not overly decadent. Can't recommend this place enough, it will not disappoint.",5 star rating,Zak G.
12/21/2018,"West Lafayette, IN",Strongly recommend! Food is stunningly fresh and delicious! I ordered Ahi Poke and New England Chowder and was amazed how fresh even the wasabi and seaweeds are!

3/8/2017,"Las Vegas, NV","Amazing beach cove location with fresh seafood! What a find! This place is simply breathtaking!As Bob Marley's ~ waiting in vain played in the background you can still hear the crashing waves right in front of you. The view from our table was heavenly, even in the dark you can see the white froth from the waves. We were lucky enough to show up during happy hour and decided to take advantage of the high top seats under the heat lamps right in front of the ocean. We indulged and the bill came out to under $60! On the beach! What a deal! Here are the details ~Large cocktails: Mai Tai & a Boathouse Punch which is filled with rum, creme de coconut, lime, orange, pineapple & nutmeg. Mahi mahi street tacos: 3 perfect bites of delicate fish, salsa, sautéed peppers and cilantro.Ahi poke: Ahi tuna, ponzu, toasted sesame, avocado, scallions and crispy wonton chips.Steamed clams: Manila clams in white wine, garlic & fresh herbs. Let that garlic bread soak up all that juice! Yes! As if that wasn't enough, we went even further with bananas foster! Every decadent bite was worth it!  Happy Hour is from 3 to close, Sun - Thu and this is really the perfect beach experience for anyone who enjoys fresh seafood. The bonus is the incredible location, right on the beach! Indoor & outdoor seating is available. Service was very friendly and can't wait to come back!",5 star rating,Ania K.

Place was packed on this particular chilly Sunday, but we were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar to wait. Had a specialty drink which was very tasty. Once our table was ready we split the crab claws which I thought was the lowest point of the meal. My husband's salad came out at the same time as mains and waitress offered to comp it. My seafood pasta was really great and had the right amount of kick. Husband really enjoyed his sea bass. Ended the evening with a 15 year Pappy at a bargain price!",4 star rating,Rimma B.

7/10/2017,"Castaic, CA","What an amazing view! Came here for my friends birthday dinner. Couldn't believe how close the restaurant was to the beach. Just a few steps away and you can sink your toes in the amazingly cool and clean water. But enough of that, let's talk food! I ordered the seafood pasta and I have to say one of the best seafood pastas I have had in quite some time. The sauce had a perfect creamy texture and the pasta was loaded with pieces of fish, shrimp, and scallops! Can easily feed two people. My friends got the mahi mahi and chicken. I knocked off 1 star because though I know seafood is expensive, I felt the mahi mahi dish was lacking some more veggies for the price. The dish was so small compared to my dish. As for the chicken, I knocked off 1 star because it was crowded with corn which didn't pair well with the flavors of the dish. Overall, I would still come back just to order that pasta and enjoy the beach!",3 star rating,Rasha H.

7/1/2019,"Albuquerque, NM",This is a restaurant that needs to be avoided. The service was horrible and the management is completely indifferent to any issues. I have contacted the restaurant repeatedly and they have not responded that is why i am writing a negative review.

My parents were very impressed not only with the view (we saw an empty table outside with a perfect view of the beach/shoreline and the waitress seated us there when we asked) but also the food. My dad had the corned beef hash and the meat was so tender; the egg was perfectly poached as well and the potatoes well seasoned. Their biscuit is delicious, crumbly with a light coating of sugar! Definitely different from any other biscuit I've had before. The waitress was very accommodating as well and helped us take a picture with the ocean as the background. Highly recommend this place",4 star rating,Irrek U.

My husband and I came for a late lunch and the service was not great. She wouldn't have come to our table if we didn't flag her down. My husband had a spider in his drink then it took 10 minutes to get a replacement. They ran out of lobster roll and I was looking forward to trying that. Our table cloth was dirty so we had to switch tables, but the girl was nice about it and apologized. My husband ordered the fish and chips; they were okay. I ordered fish tacos that were good. We shared the black mussels and those were delicious. I'm disappointed in this place to say the least. Beautiful view which was the highlight of the experience.",1 star rating,Jacqui A.

4/7/2018,"CA, CA","On our way to Solvang, we stopped here for a bite to eat from seeing other reviews here on yelp. Being a dog lover and knowing the restaurant is located on a dog beach, we just had to check it out. For my entree I chose the grilled tofu. The tofu pieces were largely cut, grilled, and topped with a with a pineapple salsa. It came with asparagus and green beans accompanied with a small mound of mango sticky rice and below a coconut curry sauce. The dish was very tasty but wish it came with a little more curry sauce as tofu is quite bland on its own.  Seating at the restaurant is a bit cramped but the gorgeous view of the ocean and seeing all the four legged friends on the beach compensates for it.",4 star rating,Jennifer C.

6/17/2018,"Santa Maria, CA",We went for Father's Day and our server was just terrible we were waiting for our food and they were taking long and noticed our server was talking to his friends at the bar. It was to the point where another server had to step in and bring us the food and apologized for him. Then after we finished eating we paid and asked for a to go box and waited again to where another server again asked us if we wanted one and told her we've been waving for one and she took the liberty to bring us one because the server we got wasn't getting it. Other than the one server everything else was fine. I'm glad other people stepped in to take over what he couldn't do that shows they care about the restaurant instead of just looking the other way. The food overall was great the view was amazing. We will come back and I hope not to get the same guy who doesn't deserve to work at such a nice restaurant,3 star rating,Isidro B.
8/2/2019,"Pico Rivera, CA","Right on the beach (oceanfront). Good selection and taste, as far as the food is concerned. Natasha, our waitress, was extremely helpful, professional and attentive. I must mention, they have an outside patio, which necessitates leaving the door open for the waiters to carry trays back and forth. This does allow some flies into the restaurant. They mostly attached themselves to the large picture windows and left the guests alone. But some people might be bothered by the sight of the flies.",5 star rating,rhonda r.

Food- just ok. Dessert was yummy! Steak frites - good portion ; fries had great flavor Mahi Mahi salad- fish was good but salad was not the best fit. Drenched in a sweet ginger dressing that overpowered the plate. Grilled Skuna bay Salmon with mashed potatoes- didn't try this one but pictured. They enjoyed it Kids grilled cheese - too much butter on bread. Comes with fries, too much carbs better to replace with fruit next time Birthday dessert - HOMEMADE MACADAMIA NUT MUD PIE- fight for the last bite, good!

7/29/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I came here to celebrate my birthday with three other friends. We tried to hit the happy hour on a Sunday evening, but it was pretty crowded, so we opted to wait for a table. (A slight heads up, if you are dining, you will not be able to order from the happy hour menu). It worked out for the best because we were able to watch all of the fun dogs on the beach while we waited! The service is wonderful, and the view of the ocean from the inside is spectacular. The menu is pretty pricey, but the appetizers are good portions and not as expensive. I recommend ordering appetizers if you do not plan on eating a lot and spending a lot! The happy hour is a good alternative, but I wouldn't count on finding somewhere to sit right away. Overall, wonderful atmosphere and friendly staff.",4 star rating,Jennifer H.
3/10/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","My best friend's boyfriend proposed to her in the morning and booked Hendry's for dinner. His plan was to surprise his bride-to-be with a celebratory dinner with her best friends. He made reservations way ahead of time. This obviously was a special occasion so I thought that the hosts would be more accomodating. He requested a table next to the window so we could have a view of the sunset, but they told us that something at the entrance was the best they could do. Still a nice view, but still not what he had in mind. Other than that small hiccup, everything else was great. Our waiter made up for that little bump on the road because his service was phenomenal. Very attentive, kind, patient, and prompt. Everyone really enjoyed their dishes. I had the blackened sea bass and tried some of my friend's seafood pasta. Great dishes. Hendry's is a lot more casual than we thought (not a bad or good thing, just not what we expected). Its best quality is the BEYOND GORGEOUS view. Parking is TERRIBLE.

5/20/2017,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA","A spontaneous road trip to Santa Barbara on a Thursday gave us and hour and a half (roughly) to look at Yelp reviews and find the perfect place to satisfy our cravings and this place was it. I can definitely skip to the end about how ecstatic we were to arrive to a semi-private restaurant on its own beach with free parking! (Think Paradise Cove in Malibu minus all the bs).The views were amazing, the staff were amazing, because it was midweek we didn't have to wait. The hostess sat us down at a beautiful table right in front of the large window, so my friend and I could enjoy the views. It was a remarkable clear day and beyond perfect to be able to watch the blue ocean wave while we ate and drank.The cocktails can add up at the end of the day, but they make them nice and strong so you can actually enjoy yourself and don't have to waste money on expensive watered-down drinks. We had the blood orange margaritas with extra jalapeños, it definitely was one of the best ones I've ever had!The food was fresh, tasted absolutely delicious, and by the time we were finished with lunch, happy hour started and we could continue drinking and eating on the porch outside by the bar. We watch the sunset, sobered up with some fries, and headed back to LA around 9:30 PM.I absolutely loved my experience there so much, that I took my mother and aunts there for Mother's Day, absolutely guarantee that they had an amazing time just as much as we did the first!

I tried the mushroom and spinach omelette, and the pork belly Benedict. I definitely recommend the pork belly Benedict. On another occasion, I've eaten a salad and a burger and they were solid. You probably can't go wrong with any of the food choices here. The boathouse is an instant winner when you consider the location, sitting right at the oceanfront. It has a great vibe for one to hang out, have something good to eat for all types of eaters, and order as many drinks as one can handle. There is plenty of parking, an outdoor public restroom in addition to the restaurant's restroom, and plenty of shade in the outdoor seating area for a good time on any occasion. The outdoor seating area has a glass wall fixture built around the perimeter with slight openings throughout to allow guests to enjoy a gentle ocean breeze.",4 star rating,Matthew N.

Happy hour is fun and usually a good group around the bar and friendly bartenders.  Great local wines available - last time I had a Brander Sauv Blanc. If you don't have reservations for a meal you might have to wait a little bit, but who would mind?

It was perfect!We had inside seating and enjoyed the view and the sea breeze.Host and wait staff were courteous and friendly. Will definitely go back for breakfast and bring our dogs.

8/16/2019,"San Jose, CA","Beautiful view! Wish we were able to stay in town long enough for their lunch! We were able to have breakfast here and the wait on a Sunday was about 45 minutes around 1030am. They have a large selection of alcohol but the micheladas are watered down and not spiced enough. The corned beef hash is not your typical corn beef hash, they were cubes of ham with onions and bell peppers. We had the lobster/shrimp omelette and that was pretty good but the just put the spinach and stuff inside an egg like a taco instead of scrambling it in. The French toast is tiny, bland and dry. We couldn't eat the crust, only the inside. Our server was sweet and attentive. Only reason why it's 4 stars instead of 3. I like the view and service but food is ok. Lunch/dinner would probably be waaaayyy better!",4 star rating,Andora B.

It's a popular place so make sure to make reservations or you can enjoy yourself at the bar while you wait.Drinks: really good (and strong)!

First impression I walk in and the two blonde hostesses are so disrespectful they didn't even acknowledge me and I had to say something to them. Even then, they were so put out on the fact that they even had to talk to me. Then the busser has the worst attitude ever, he didn't even make eye contact and had a dirty look on his face the whole time. Thank you to the short blonde haired waitress and the red haired food runner for saving this experience, the waitress took great care of us and answered all of our questions.

Even if you aren't seated along the glass, the fresh air and decor on its own is fire. We ordered the raw bar oysters as an appetizer which came to be about $45 for a dozen. For lunch, I got the seafood pasta. My sister ordered the fish tacos and her boyfriend ordered the ahi club. Im not big on seafood but this place definitely converted me. I have a new love and appreciation for seafood. To top it all off, we ordered the banana foster, vanilla bean creme brûlée, and macadamia nut mud pie for dessert.

9/30/2018,"Seattle, WA","We like the Boathouse.  In fact, we are weekend breakfast regulars.  But here's the problem:  the inefficiency with which they turn tables.  They shortened the window for breakfast by an hour, at the same time as it is always at least an hour wait to get in.  So it's frustrating while waiting- hoping for breakfast - to just watch tables sit empty for 20 minutes at a time.  Trust me, I've timed it.  The explanation I got was ""people aren't showing up when I buzz them.""  Suggestion: Get a better system for turning tables.  You are losing money when tables sit empty.  Or maybe you don't care?",3 star rating,Deanna Z.

5/17/2018,"Woodland Hills, CA","Stopped here for lunch during a day trip to Santa Barbara. Our overall experience was okay. I ordered the boathouse punch which was delicious, but waiter left without giving a straw. When I asked she said they didn't give straws unless requested. Thought that was odd because I've never seen anyone drink out of a hurricane glass without a straw before. Clam chowder here is very good. However, everything else left us a little underwhelmed. The mahi mahi salad was bland, but the pulled pork grilled cheese was a joke. There were only a few crumbles of cheese and the supposed caramelized onions were actually still raw. Not sure if it was an off day?",3 star rating,Sheila A.

Kudos & gracias to the Boathouse for doing this.We enjoyed a bowl of chowder new England... could have been heated a little more... the much anticipated crab cakes were very good, however, a bit more time on the flat top for a crust would have been appreciated and also perhaps a small dipping container of the aioli.  The fish tacos ordered were delicious and filling.  Daughter enjoyed the mule and I a simple beer.  I wished the bowl of soup would have been bigger & warmer but thn, this is just an indicator of having enjoyed a good meal!  Service was delightful and we truly experienced wait staff who were good servers who hoped we enjoyed our meal.",4 star rating,Linda K.

We lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant, but parking is tight here so be prepared. Our plan was just to grab lunch and be on our way, but we decided to stay since the restaurant was right on the beach.There was a long line, but the wait was no issue since you get the great view of the beach. Service was fast and food was good. The fish n chips weren't too special, but gets the job done. The seafood pasta was one of the best and very fresh.Overall, a great place to enjoy lunch if you're in the area.

8/16/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","The view is gorgeous. That cocktail and sandwich I had for lunch? *works up Darth Vader voice*, ""Impressive.""The location is beautiful. If you call it ""Arroyo Burro"", clearly you're not from around here. I'm an 8th generation Santa Barbarian, but it doesn't take 230 years of local family history to know this--Hendry's Beach it is. Being able to eat inside or even on the patio is a treat. You see the beach, the ocean, the passers-by, tucked in between cliffs and right along the creek, and you know why the Chumash made this place home, and why so many of us that came after decided to stay. I had the Ahi Club Sandwich and rarely have I had that kind of rich flavor in a sandwich. I could taste the ahi, the bacon, the pineapple, and everything in between. It's a tall, healthy serving of a sandwich, and you might be able to split it, but you also may not want to after taking your first bite. Add in some fries and good conversation, and you've got everything you need for a truly good afternoon. About that drink I mentioned: the Hibiscus Collins is delicious. The color itself makes you want to have two or three, but it's a refreshing midday cocktail that won't have you wincing at a strong taste of alcohol even though it's got plenty in it.  Definitely recommend the Boathouse for lunch, whether you live here, or are just paying us a visit in the City of Saint Barbara.",4 star rating,Chief E.

I use to love bringing my dog to patio to eat breakfast but not allowed anymore. She was always so good an just stayed under my table. However , did have a big dig that was not being watched was inches from taking the bacon right off my plate. Too bad everyone can't control an watch their own dog.

9/4/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","First of all, the view was incredible both inside & outside the restaurant! Also, the beach is dog friendly so it was really awesome being able to pet friendly dogs while waiting to be seated. The wait was really long on a Saturday for brunch, around 45 mins, so I would recommend going earlier if you want to be seated more promptly. They serve the breakfast menu until 2pm, and they start serving lunch at 11:30am. So if you want to be able to choose from both menus, come from 11:30am-2pm. Overall the food was really yummy, though there were some drawbacks. We decided not to order breakfast food and ordered off their lunch menu.Appetizers:The CRAB CAKES were somewhat on the smaller side, but they were not stingy with the amount of crab inside. It wasn't all breading like it is at other restaurants. You could really taste the crab. The CLAM CHOWDER was delicious, but was too rich for my liking because there was too much cream. If you order the bowl, you probably won't be able to finish your main dish as the chowder is really filling.If there's one thing you should order here, it's the LOBSTER TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE. It was HEAVEN ON EARTH. The Panko flakes really enhanced the texture of the dish, and there was a ton of lobster chunks too. You could really taste the truffle in this too! Highly recommend their lobster Mac & cheese. You could even just order this as a main dish instead and have it all for yourself! Main dishes:The CIOPPINO was on the salty side and was a bit too tomato-ey. I've had better cioppinos at other restaurants. With that being said, they were very very generous with the amount of seafood plated. The SEAFOOD PASTA was really delicious, and they were also really generous with the amount of large shrimps they put in there. Their KOBE BURGER was alright, nothing too special, but worth ordering if you're craving for a classic cheeseburger & fries.",4 star rating,Kristen M.

The Shellfish Company specializes in steamed crab, local lobster and ridge back shrimp. In 1999, they opened the Santa Barbara FisHouse on Cabrillo ave, their first venture into the full dining. Now with the Boathouse they have 3 oceanfront seafood restaurants.So of course now we will have to try out the other two! Since they have similar menu items maybe lunch at one and dinner at the other,We had stopped here before for a drink during a ""Yelp Event Christmas Lights bus Tour"" Today we decided to give the breakfast a go so we got a table on the patio with a great view of the ocean. bring on the food!I will always go for the Eggs Bene,and they have like 3 to choose form and the signature breakfast too!Of course as always, we pre taste the hollandaise which was a bit more buttery than most I have had. I don't think this would have worked with well with Canadian bacon, it did however compliment the black forest ham very well.I got the CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT Served on a toasted English muffin, poached eggs, black forest ham, citrus hollandaise & Boathouse breakfast potatoes super amount of flavor and lots of garlic in the taters too.My Partner in crime got the BOATHOUSE SIGNATURE BREAKFAST fresh poached eggs over fatty homemade crab cakes, with a tasty Chipotle hollandaise, fresh avocado, pico de gallo & Boathouse breakfast potatoes. I gotta throw down 4 stars on this one as both of of our plates came out with basically hard boiled eggs and not the normal poached to perfection runny goodness we expect in a poached egg.We summoned our server and she said oh that's not right, then she was quick to take our plates and bring them back with perfect eggs in like 3 minutes.. a big plus leaving no time to stew over the failed eggs.  The whole staff and service was great they all worked well together.",4 star rating,Jim K.

4/26/2018,"Discovery Bay, CA","This is one busy and popular restaurant. Parking is shared with the beach so sometimes an issue in the late afternoon.We had a 6.15 reservation but showed up early and were still given prime seats with ocean views. That changed when we decided on a happy hour menu and were ushered to zero view outdoor seating.Anticipating small plates for happy hour, we ordered fried calamari, fish and chips, ahi tuna and mussels. Big mistake! All of these were regular size dinner meals and we struggled to eat 75% of what was in front of us. Mussels- delicious! Ditto the ahi tuna with avocado. Seaweed and wontons. Fish and chips - nice fish but didn't touch the fries. Deep fried calamari woul be a great starter for two people.With two happy hour drinks, our entire bill was $52 with tax. Very good value and next time we will know better when ordering not to underestimate serving sizes.",4 star rating,Bruce H.

6/6/2019,"SYLMAR, CA","Drove here for lunch from LA yesterday. THE BEST SEAFOOD PASTA EVER!!! Had their garlic bread and England clam chowder, all were tasty. Big portion, the scallops and prawns were cooked perfectly!! I did have to add a bit of salt to my dish, but I prefer it this way than it being too salty. Everything sounds good on the menu, I would definitely come back to try more things here. Hostesses were nice and accommodating. Our waitress, Morgan, was sweet, attentive and professional. Just don't mind the pesky persistent flies flying around since the restaurant is open to the outdoor. I want a fan of the fresh squeezed orange juice.",4 star rating,Alice T.
4/9/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is mosdef my favorite place!! Dominic, Scottie, Billy, Nick, Leslie-- all the bartenders are my biggest fave in this town. ALL the bartenders who've provided me service have been amazing and quite accommodating to picky drinkers like me. FUN FACT: One afternoon during the holidays; I happened to ask Leslie for a spiced cider and it just so happens NOT to be on the menu. She was very kind enough to make it for me given the ingredients that were available AND the drink she made was quite delicious!I will bring my friends here from LA and will never stop talking about how much I love this place!",5 star rating,D O.
4/2/2016,"Alexandria, VA","Came here today with a few friends and was not pleased with the experience. It first seemed pleasant and the ladies in the front were very kind and welcoming. The biggest issue I had was how long it took the server to come to us for anything (i.e., the menus, water/drinks, our food, the check, the change from our check). Someone told me they were understaffed which I totally understand, but how can you possibly say this and have people (who came way after us) get served left and right? I've been waiting to come to this restaurant for a while and although the the view is spectacular, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the service.In addition, the food was not warm when it got to us. If you're willing to have brunch for 2.5 hours (most of it being waiting time), I'd recommend this place. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but I'm just not pleased with my experience.",1 star rating,Jennie K.
7/23/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","The food has improved over the years and the location is unbeatable. We always arrive 1-1.5 hours early to play at the beach beforehand, if we go on the weekends. It is a busy beach, so parking is tight. We love the location and take out of town guests here at every opportunity. The SB Omelette is my favorite because it is delicious with avo and veggies. You can't go wrong with most of the menu items that fit your palette.",3 star rating,Jillian D.
6/4/2016,"Tampa, FL","Great beachside restaurant that's well known for their brunch...although we had just missed it. Awesome patio seating that's dog friendly, indoor seating is really open and feels as if you're sitting outdoors still. Food was delicious and the seafood was especially fresh. We ordered oysters (2of each kind they had), the fish n chips, and the ahi club. Oysters were exceptional, the fish n chips were perfectly fried, and the ahi club was so so good. Served with bacon, avocado, Cole slaw and pineapple slice...which was honestly the kicker. Washed it down with one of their specialty drinks: hibiscus Collins. Delish.  Waiters and staff were very kind and cordial, the view of the beach was amazing, and the food was incredible. What more do you need?",5 star rating,John G.
5/8/2016,"Milwaukee, WI","I was taken here by one of my hosts when in the city on vacation - she told me this is the place she brings all her guests when they come to Santa Barbara, and I can see why! It was a chilly night so we sat inside instead of on the patio, but there are still huge windows and stunning ocean views.Everyone who served our table was very polite and attentive; in fact, the service was so quick that our food got to the table before our waitress had even brought out the bread basket! (We got one a few minutes later.) And when one of our party asked about the bacon/shrimp garnish that was missing from her Bloody Mary, which apparently only comes in the ""signature"" Bloody, our waitress quickly brought out bacon and shrimp for her. She was also very nice about taking a photo of our group before we left.I had the scallops with lobster and crab risotto and broccolini. Scallops are a huge favorite of mine, and these were tender and delicious. Definitely a thumbs up from me. We couldn't agree on a dessert so, of course, we had to get two: bananas foster and a brownie sundae (and an espresso martini, of course). The martini and both desserts were delicious...I'm definitely partial to chocolate, but the bananas foster was also very good.Overall, my visit to the Boathouse scratched the itch I had for a California seafood experience. Great food and great views - who could ask for more?",4 star rating,Jennifer P.
3/27/2019,"Tustin, CA","Came here to come to the dog beach and figured I would order food from this place since I misunderstood and thought this was a dog friendly place. It is technically not. You would have to leave your dog outside while you eat. I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito to go and it was pretty good. Had to ask for hot sauce (tapatio) in a to go container. a bit different that it came with queso fresco on the side which was a nice twist since I'm not used to that. Overall it was a decent breakfast burrito and I was able to order a drink while I waited for my food. Nice views and easy access to the beach and reasonably priced. Although the parking Is a pain.

We had the corned beef hash and the pork belly benedict. Both were really tasty and stood out on their own. Similar in plating but different flavors altogether. Docked a star due to the wait time. Not sure if it was just because it iust opened or whatever but we had a bit of wait between getting a waiter/waitress to getting our bill at the end. Overall I highly recommend the place.

6/27/2016,"Los Angeles, CA",I was torn between 2 or 3 stars on this one. A friend suggested I try this place to celebrate a special birthday. So I made a reservation & drove up with the BF.My experience was disappointing primarily due to how bad my food was. I ordered the mahi mahi with mango sticky rice. BIG mistake. The fish had no flavor & there was nothing mango OR sticky about the rice. I ended up smothering my fish in bbq sauce to get it down. The Calamari appetizer was decent but nothing to write home about. And the special punch tasted like pineapple juice with creme. For the caliber of restaurant with waterfront ambience they really should resolve the fly problem in doors. I needed my own personal fly swatter and the window sill appeared to not have been cleaned in days because dead flies were everywhere. The best thing about this place was the service! Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of our waitress who was super sweet. But Simon was awesome! He pitched in for practically everything & I loved his attentiveness.Next time I might just go back to experience the beach with snacks minus restaurant dining.,2 star rating,Melissa Sharee M.

2/25/2018,"Santa Monica, CA","This was my second visit to the Boathouse as I was celebrating my birthday. The view is hard to beat, however the service was not the best. The server was not as attentive and only came over once with our food but did not make an effort to check on us so I had to repeatedly ask other staff for certain things. The signature breakfast was a hit, the crab cakes were very delicious. On the other hand, the pancakes were rather dry, but were a very large portion. The lobster omelette and pork belly benedict were also very tasty. While the food was decent, it did not live up to its hyped up reputation.",3 star rating,Magda M.
4/29/2018,"Newbury Park, CA","It is kind of a Paradise Cove feel with different food. The atmosphere is great! You don't have to pay to park which is nice but it is pretty packed from all the beach goers, so you will be searching for parking for a bit. The location is sort of tucked away but great spot. Food is great, I enjoyed the lunch chicken salad and the rest of my party had burgers. Reasonably priced for the location. For 2 burgers and fries, one chicken salad, calamari appetizer and two fountain drinks, the order came to about $69 with tax. Servers and other workers are hard workers that are very easy to talk too. We got everything we needed in a timely manner. If you are looking for a great beach location to relax for lunch this is it. Especially if you are in from out of town. Sit outside!!",4 star rating,Cassandra M.

Fried calamari was crispy and well seasoned. Clam chowder was a little watery but flavorful and seafood was fresh. Kids enjoyed their penne pasta, corn dog and fries. Steak was perfectly medium and tender accompanied by yummy spinach. Fish tacos were prepared well with just right amount of kick.Service was spot on and pleasant.

When we made a stink they told us we could have one but we would just need to wait for a table to become available which wouldn't be long. Our 8 O'clock reservation turned into another hour wait. At 10 O'clock we still didn't have our food. By this time we were the only ones left in the restaurant. We spoke to the manager about an update. Instead of simply saying let me go check she rudely told us how we made a big deal about outside seating. She needs to go back to hospitality school.

9/24/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","I am furious.  And seriously disappointed.  I checked into the Boathouse about 1:15 for brunch.  I asked the hostess when breakfast was over being served.  She said, 2 pm.  I said, OK, put me on the waitlist, for 1 (person).  She looked at me a little funny, then said, OK well hoepfully u get in before 2I debated just getting my french toast to go as I was enjoying the beach but my buzzer rang at 1:40.  Great!  I get to the hostess stand and they put me in the most crammed corner on the outdoor patio, way in the back.  I don't mind the back patio, but if i had been any further in the corner I woule have been in the parking lot.  I was next to some weird water heater or restaurant appliance.It was ridiculously obvious they put me in that back corner cause I was a woman that happened to be by herself on a busy Sunday afternoon.  That is flat out discrimination.  And then, on top of that, a different hostess told me I couldn't order breakfast because they stopped serving it at 2 pm.  I was like, it's 1:45!23rd  I literally had to argue with her about it.  Then she goes, well we have last call at 1:50.  I repeated myself again, it's 1:45.  And then i told her, if you are gonna stop serving at 1:45, then you should have had the hostess tell me you stop serving at 1:45 and not have her tell me 2 pm.  It is sad and infuriating that I would have to fight so hard to have a pleasant brunch and that The Boathouse restaurant discriminates against people who decide to (heaven forbid) have brunch by themself.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  I told my server the restaurant was being incredibly rude and I left.",1 star rating,Kimberli W.

7/3/2016,"Orange County, CA","We recently ate dinner at the Boathouse at Hendry's Beach and enjoyed it very much. My husband started it all off with their blood orange margarita, and I chose The Last Word cocktail. Their menu states that the Last Word includes locally-made Cutler Gin, Luxardo Maraschino liquer, Green Chartreuse, and fresh lime juice. They were both tasty cocktails. The Last Word was quite strong, so I would suggest ordering something heavier than the salad I ordered. We sat inside the restaurant as there was a wait for outside seating, but we had great views of the beach and ocean from inside by the window. The atmosphere here is fun and lively, and even the momentary screams of a neighboring table's toddler did not dampen anyone's mood in this upbeat place.  My husband loved his sea bass dinner, and I enjoyed a flavorful chicken caesar salad for my main course.

What a picturesque place...I mean really I don't think there is a restaurant with a view quite like this one.  We must have come at the most perfect timing because we were able to watch the surfers catch some waves before enjoying the unbelievable sunset and enjoying what the restaurant had to offer. Was this the best seafood I have ever had in my life? No. Was it above average? Yup.  Would I come back again if only to enjoy the killer view and some drinks? Absolutely..and heres why... Ambiance: Perfect place with a perfect view.  There is a very cute laid back patio if you want to sit outside and enjoy alfresco or if you want a more upscale casual feel go inside and grab a table.  Every seat in the house offers perfect views that will leave you wanderlust in California living. Total score: 5/5.Service:  Our server was awesome and very attentive. Total score: 5/5Price: Entrees run around $16-$40 so a tad high for a casual place but I get it you also kinda of pay for the view which is totally understandable. Total score: 4/5What was ordered: Cup of house made chowder $5.95: Simple New England style chowder with a creamy base. They did also offer spiced Manhattan chowder but I stuck with the classic. It was ok clam chowder stuffed with lots of clam.Boathouse Seafood Pasta $22.95: Scallops, shrimp, fresh fish, penne pasta with spicy marinara cream sauce and mesquite grilled garlic bread. Though on the pricy side for pasta this serving is HUGE and quite tasty with a touch of spice. Pan Roasted Crab Cakes $14.95: Snow and rock crab cakes with a chipotle hollandaise with house made coleslaw. The crab cakes were great however the cole slaw tasted like it came out of a bag and was overly dressed. Though the food did not blow me away, I will definitely stop by if in the area if anything to grab some appetizers and cocktails because the view here is unreal.

The only reason I am giving four stars is that they really need a reservation system. This place in consistently a 1hr wait on the weekends for brunch.

I ordered the Chicken Salad with chips,  avocado salsa, black beans and tomato basil vinaigrette.  What I received was a bed of mixed greens that were tossed with dressing and chips left to wilt and get soggy then a piece of fatty chicken breast smothered in guacamole to hide the gross piece of chicken.  AAfter waiting 40 minutes to sit and having spotty inattentive service, I was too hungry to return the salad.  The service wasnt great as our plates were dropped off and no one came back to check.  I had to flag down the host to get mustard for my friend's burger.",2 star rating,Sunni V.

The bar area is small and very limited seating for happy hour but we got lucky again and found a table. Their happy hour prices are very affordable for being on the beach that made happy hour happier! Glass of Kalyra Sauvignon blanc was $6.50 and the Strawberry Jalapeño shrub cocktail was tasty. We ordered the calamari and the ahi poke about $10 each. Both were delicious and a good amount on each plate!,5 star rating,Sapphira C.

My husband got the Moscow Mule and I got the ""Step In The Right Direction"" (which was amazing!!). They were both very refreshing and tasted exactly like we hoped, which is hard to find.Thirdly, the food! My husband ordered some oysters, which were fresh and tasty. He ordered the shrimp tacos for his entree and loved them. They were a great light and fresh option if you aren't in the mood for something too heavy. I got the burger and asked to have it lettuce wrapped. It was perfect! Side note: OMG the dipping sauce is like thousand island on steroids. It tasted good on absolutely everything.

We went in for lunch. We ordered the crab cakes as an app - they were ok. I ordered the seafood pasta plus a dry rosé. The seafood pasta came out hot and was so creamy and delicious. A great perk was that it actually had a lot of shrimps unlike other places. My boyfriend ordered the Kobe beef hamburger and he said it was good. What I also loved was the ocean view.

Their oysters were excellent. Their drinks are good as well, I recommend the Bloody Mary. The only down side was that the A/C was broken and it was so hot inside.

Nothing like a late brunch and hot cup of coffee on a warm sunny day overlooking the ocean and who knows you may even spot a few dolphins. Their little dog tie up area under the palapas is great.

The drinks were really tasty and quite potent.My hubby had the shrimp Louie which looked great.  We had the pork belly Benedict, the house Benedict (crab cake) and the Kobe burger.

Also, they have a pet friendly ""tropical island"" with shade, faux grass, and water bowls to tie your pet up while you dine. No pets allowed in the actual restaurant. Makes a great time for dining and then walking your pooch at Hendry's dog-off-leash beach afterward.

We were seated next to the window which overlooked to the ocean and sunset outside the window. The ambience was noisy and the restaurant was packed! Our server was really nice explaining the menu to my mom and me since it was our first time here. We ordered the oysters rockefeller, housemade chowder, and boathouse seafood pasta. The oysters rockefeller was a bit too salty for me, but for my mom she liked it but had better oysters elsewhere. The housemade chowder satisfied my craving! This is one of the most delicious chowders I had in my life. The boathouse seafood pasta BLEW me and my mom AWAY! It is jam PACKED with seafood and the taste was AMAZING and fresh! The ratio with seafood and pasta was just PERFECT! I will definitely remember to make a reservation and come back for the chowder and pasta. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience and food!",5 star rating,Katie C.

However, every time I have gone in the hostess have been rude. Last week when I went, we were seated in the back corner-- and for some reason it smelled terrible. I asked if we could be seated elsewhere. The hostess rudely snarked and said that we would be put on the bottom of the waitlist and we would have to wait an hour to be seated again. As she is saying this I was looking around and there were many open tables. We almost got up and left right then and there due to her attitude. I have never been treated like this and I do not plan to go back anytime soon. No food is worth being treated like that.",2 star rating,Hayley W.

11/30/2015,"Dallas, TX","Talk about prime location! The Boathouse is located directly on the beach, I mean right on there, so you can watch the waves while you eat. And then wander along the sand after your meal. We arrived, a party of six without reservations, on a Friday night around 5:30, and even though the place was hopping we were seated on their beautiful patio within ten minutes. The patio was thick with heat lamps, and we were kept nice and cozy on an otherwise chilly evening. We started the meal with drinks. I had the house margarita, which was delicious. My boyfriend had a Lagunitas, which he enjoyed. Everyone at the table had only good things to say about their beverages. We were also served a basket of warm, delicious sourdough bread with butter, and it was devoured (and immediately replaced). For my entree, I ordered the Local Petrale Sole. As a North Texas resident, a locally caught fish was a treat I couldn't pass up. And this fish was exquisite. It melted in my mouth. It was served in a lemon-caper butter sauce over garlic-roasted fingerling potatoes and market vegetables. It was a lot of food, but I didn't ever want to stop eating it!Other dishes at our table included the Grilled Mahi Mahi, the Spice-Rubbed Grilled Pacific Seabass, the Grilled Ahi Tuna, the Grilled Mahi Mahi Salad and the Beet & Citrus Salad. I can honestly say that we all loved our food--everyone was in seafood heaven!   After dinner, the six of us split two desserts: the Macadamia Nut Mud Pie and the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. The Mud Pie was served in an adorable little mason jar, and it was definitely my favorite dessert of the two. You had to dig deep to get to the crust, but it was worth it. The cheesecake was an adorable little round cake, not a slice, and it was on the less-than-sweet side (I have a serious sweet tooth) but it, too, was yummy. The six of us ate well for around $200, which when you factor in drinks and dessert is not that bad for a swanky place like this one. I highly recommend Boathouse at Hendry's Beach if you're looking for a delicious seafood meal in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Charlotte J.

Typically at a beachside restaurant, you'll pay A LOT for subpar food but that's not the case here. It's a little pricey but the food is outstanding and is justifiable based on the quality of the experience. If you're here for brunch, you must try the Signature Breakfast - crab cakes topped with poached eggs and chipotle aioli. To. Die. For. For dinner, cocktails are great and the mixed seafood pasta.

This seemed like a good idea at the time but once the sun started blaring down at us it became a bit uncomfortable. We asked our water if they had an umbrella and he told us they couldn't move them from the outside dining area. This was a bit disappointing but I guess it was our fault for choosing to sit in that area. The food was very good, my bloody mary was so yummy, and the view is spectacular!

My only criticism is that on saturdays and sundays it can sometimes take 45 mins to an hour to get seated.  They do however give you a buzzer, which allows you to walk around or sit at the bar while you wait.  Food is pretty good!

7/1/2015,"Montreal, Canada",This place is very mediocre and overpriced as you may expect from the only place to get food at Hendry's BeachI asked the waiter which of the fish on the menu were local to which he responded that none were. I find that to be pretty sad for a seafood joint right on the water. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Club which was tiny for $19 and the actual tuna was pretty tastelessMy girlfriend had a pretty nice salad and I enjoyed the passion fruit ice tea. Other than that I'd try to avoid this place,3 star rating,Greg W.

7/28/2018,"Newbury Park, CA","I can't say enough positive things about this place.  First of all, it's located on an off-leash dog beach.  I mean come on.  Every dog owner within 60 miles of this place should make the drive at least once.  After that you'll be hooked.  Let your pooch run on the sand for a while, and then tie him to the hitching post and go in and have a wonderful meal.  I've been here many times for breakfast and dinner.  Best breakfast items are the crab cake benedict, chilaquiles, and Huevos Hope Ranch.  Best dinner items are the ceviche, coconut shrimp, cioppino, and the sea bass.  This place is right on the ocean, so you can watch pelicans and dolphins eat while you eat.  Love love love!!!",5 star rating,Cindi R.

We went on a Saturday morning around 8:00 am and were seated right away. I started with a Bloody Mary. It was strong yet full of spice and flavors with all the works. I am a sucker for bacon in a Bloody Mary! For our meal I had the salmon Benedict and my husband had the signature breakfast. They were both absolutely delicious. Only complaint was that the salmon was more on the saltier side. The signature breakfast was full of flavor and colors. The crab cakes were cooked perfectly with a crispy outer crust. The service was on point. Very attentive and polite. We will definitely be back.,5 star rating,Vaish P.

She would roll her eyes at everything we would say, and kept making rude faces at us. I assume it was because the tip was included in the bill so she didn't care how rude she was. We were nothing but polite while ordering but it seemed like she was taking out all her anger on us. This is unacceptable behavior, she snapped at me for asking her a simple question about one of the items on the menu.

4/27/2017,"San Diego, CA","My parents and I went to The Boathouse for happy hour today. Picturesque views of the Pacific, beautiful afternoon sunshine with a breeze, and lots of happy people (including the staff!). I got the Blackberry Mai Tai which was excellent; strong tropical flavors, great balance with the rum, and even blackberries floating in the drink. I previously got the Boathouse Punch, which is also nice and fruity, but the Blackberry Mai Tai is my new favorite. Speaking of favorites, I was floored by the grilled tofu with mango sticky rice, vegetables, coconut curry, and pineapple salsa. I am not usually a vegetarian eater, but I saw this on their menu and it sounded so good I had to try it. I was not disappointed at all. The tofu was perfectly grilled, striking a balance between the soft tofu inside and a slightly crispy, browned outside. The vegetables were perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper and pan-seared in olive oil, giving them a burst of flavor. The waiter mentioned the coconut curry sauce recipe had recently been revised with extra heat, which is something I enjoy. Even with the extra heat I did not find it overpowering and it really added a nice kick to the meal. The pineapple salsa which topped the tofu tasted fresh, tropical, and actually worked really well with the coconut curry flavors. As you can tell by the fact that I wrote a review simply based on one dish, I really enjoyed my experience here. I'm looking forward to going back and having this dish again, as well as exploring the rest of the menu. My eyes are on you next, pulled-pork grilled cheese sandwich!",5 star rating,Justin H.

Jesse was great! He said that the weather wasn't great, and they weren't too busy, so he would go ahead and take our reservation. That made my day!  They gave us the best table for the view, and we enjoyed every moment sitting and watching all the dogs play! I love how the Boathouse even has ""dog parking!"" It's too cute to watch all the dogs playing and enjoying the beach, and the restaurant with its amazing menu is the perfect vantage point!  Don't miss the Bacon Bloody Mary!  The chowder fries are interesting and fun, and the calamari is really tasty!  We always get the Seafood Omelet Special, and also the Crabs Benedict Special, both are our favorites.  Today I had the neptune salad, too.  We ordered the fruit and granola kids meal and it looked fit for a king! The chocolate chip pancakes rocked, as well. Service was running a little behind today but seriously, who cares in an atmosphere like that with food that is just plain special?  I love that they never rely on their awesome view to compensate for their food... the food is good! The menu is varied, and you won't be disappointed unless you don't like dogs, or can't think of anything else to complain about this week. Great time, and special hat tip to Jesse for giving us grace and letting us make the reservation! It made our family vacation picture perfect!",4 star rating,Gigi L.

They were just giving it away!    Not too unlike their happy hour where they are still kind of giving it away!   Honestly it is one of Santa Barbara's great happy hours!   Good drinks at very good prices and great food deals as well.    Only problem is that it is so popular getting a seat is often difficult!   Can't fault the restaurant for being popular though! If you eat in the dining room or the patio prices are fair.   Considering the spectacular view and the rent that they must be paying they are actually pretty reasonable!    I would call the food good, not fantastic but good.   I have really enjoyed the shrimp tacos (and the lobster tacos).    Last time I was there I had the steak sandwich for lunch ($12.95)  it was good but I could tell that the dish had been sitting in the pass for a while as the fries were not hot.    I think that my only disappointment was the time I ordered the fish and chips.    The fish reminded me of fish sticks.   All very rectangular and uniform.     In all honesty I would say that this restaurant is a VERY solid three star restaurant but with the happy hour specials and the spectacular view it gets four.  (so tempted to knock it back to three because of the parking but again, not their fault!)",4 star rating,Douglas M.
6/8/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Wow, Just WOW boathouse Easiest 5/5 ranking I've ever given. Boathouse is truly an amazing and enjoyable dining experience! We arrived here on a Saturday night around 5:30PM and the dining area was already packed with reservations until 9PM, (luckily for us the hostess was gracious and found us a spot). Definitely make a reservation if you're set on eating here (which you should be).We ended up getting spots at the bar and were greeted by two very handsome attentive bartenders. Not only are they gregarious and kind, they make a SMOKING cocktail, literally... Their cocktail special was 'Smoke & Fire' made with Mastero Dobel SIlver, Petelon Mezal, fresh lime and house made peach habenero shrub. I was in love, definitely a hand crafted cocktail experience, very impressive.On to the wine list... I am a huge wine fan and I had VERY high expectations for the wine list after enjoying their cocktails and.... of course they delivered! They specialize in local small boutique wineries, and had a LOT of amazing red wines by the glass (not just Pinot Noir). Our server was knowledgeable about the wines which helped us make our selections.FOOD TIME! They had the best fresh, wait for it.. SANTA BARBARA UNI! Way to keep it local guys. We also had more 'Ocean To Table' food-  sauteed sea bass served dill lemon butter sauce, market veggies and savory risotto. & Grilled Skuna Bay Salmon with lobster mashed potatoes, leaf spinach, asparagus & white wine butter sauce. 10/10/10 for all of our plates.Thank you Boathouse, your service, food and atmosphere are all A+++",5 star rating,Nicole H.

Also for being in Santa Barbara I thought maybe the prices would be outrageous but pretty normal I thought. My filet mignon, which was quite large by the way, $30 and with potatoes and veggies. Reasonable I thought and it was just an o really fun experience. They were super busy so we did have to wait for food but with having cocktails, the views and good friends I didn't mind at all. We were there about 2 plus hours.  My food was good, not amazing but still good hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

She seemed rude at my request where I would to sit and bra- less. She sat me at another table anyway. The couple next to be seated (which was 15 min later) were directed by the hostess to the table I requested. I felt maybe it was a racial thing or because I was wearing a bra. I spoke to the manager about the situation and given complimentary dessert. My waitress was kind, food was just like any other sea food place in the city, clean atmosphere, and clean restroom.Despite the ungracious treatment by the hostess first impression is the most important.

The hostesses are super nice and friendly too (: Boathouse Signature Breakfast ($17.95)         - This was by far my favorite dish here! It was the perfect amount of hollandaise and the crabcakes were cooked to perfection.          - The bed of potatoes were a plus. It comes with a side of avocado and pico de gallo which complemented the dish very well. California Benedict ($14.95)         - Your typical veggie benedict; nothing remarkable.         - Portions were filling. Santa Barbara Omlette ($13.95)         - Farm fresh vegetables (cauliflower, zucchini) were REALLY good!         - Not enough cheese at all, which was the downside.         - It comes with toast too! By far, the biggest breakfast Ive had here. Chowder         - I love the chowder here! Good amount of stuff inside! Sesame Seared Tuna (DO NOT GET! I'd dock off a star just for this.)        - For $15.95, I felt like I got nothing... portions are nonexistent.        - The salad was overdressed and the seared tuna was medicore.        - Definitely a disappointment thats ruined seared ahi tuna salads for me. Boathouse Seafood Pasta       - Ate some off a friend. The sauce was SO good. I'd recommend!       - Not a huge seafood person so I cant speak for that, but it looked like a good amount of scallops, shrimps, clams(?) I'm coming back to try other dishes!

4/28/2017,"Gilbert, AZ","I give Boathouse a 5 star for location and view, but really a 1 or 2 star for the food and service. The food was seriously lack-luster. We went for brunch and my husband and I both ordered the chilaquiles, and I got a short stack of pancakes on the side because #pregnancy. The chilaquiles were really quite bland, and I do recognize that I'm from Arizona where the mexican food is REAL mexican food, so I might be a bit spoiled, but it really wasn't good in general.The pancakes were ok, but were a bit dry. I did, however, eat them all so I probably can't complain too much.The service was pretty lack-luster. The guy who was supposed to be our server would walk around the tables acting like he was doing something, but then would just walk over to the corner and stand there with a menu in his hand talking to other servers. He made eye contact with us several times before we had even been asked for our drink orders, and it took us literally flagging him down to get him to come over. It also took quite a while for us to get our food - I'm talking like 30-40 minutes. It was a little ridiculous.The view, though, is second to none. If we ever went back, I'd want to sit at the bar so I can get the full view of the ocean and the dog-friendly beach!",3 star rating,Elisabeth I.

Great view, and overall a nice spot. My boyfriend ordered chile breakfast nachos and he definitely didn't get enough chips, ended up like soggy nachos but the taste was definitely present.. I got the salmon plate. What I didn't like was it wasn't put together like the description made it seem, plain bagel with a side of dill cream cheese and pieces of salmon, capers and such.

8/10/2017,"Scottsdale, AZ",Perfect location!!! Right on a beautiful beach with amazing views of the ocean. We came for breakfast and dinner. Suggest reservations for dinner. Bring a blanket and enjoy the beach with a drink while you are waiting!! We got a table by the window and you just cannot beat those views. I would have come back even if food was terrible. Fortunately for us everything was spectacular. One of the best cioppinos I have ever had. Service was amazing! Our server even wrote down a few places we should check out while visiting.,5 star rating,Tammy N.

12/11/2016,"Bakersfield, CA","This is normally our favorite place to eat because of the excellent service, beautiful atmosphere, and delicious food.  Unfortunately we had an awful experience that made us feel like we are never going back to eat another meal at Boathouse again. It was December 1st and my wife and I were celebrating our eleven year anniversary married. This was particularly special because for the last five months I have been working in Santa Barbara and away from my wife and children who live three hours away. We only get to see each other on some weekends and my wife drove all the way to Santa Barbara to surprise me for just a couple hours for our anniversary and then to drive straight home back to our children. When we decided to go to dinner, we didn't even have to have a discussion on where we were going to eat. The Boathouse is my wife's favorite restaurant in SB and we drove straight over to enjoy a nice dinner and to spend time together that we hardly ever get alone. We were lucky because on this particular night the restaurant was mostly empty (just as they had told us on the phone when we called earlier to make a reservation) and we were able to get a good seat outside right by the water. After a few minutes we were seated.  We hung out and after 25 minutes (I know the exact time because we were taking pictures and sending them to our family so we could see the time stamp on the phone) we realized that no one had come to wait on us. My wife walked up to the hostess and let her know that we hadn't seen our waiter yet.  The hostess was kind and apologized stating she would get someone right over to help us. Another 15 passed and still nothing. At this point I walked to the bar and bought a soda for my wife and a beer for myself. Another ten minutes later Lucas the waiter came to our table and gave us a story about how super busy the restaurant was (which wasn't true) for taking so long and thanked us for ""taking swift action and getting our own drinks"".   We informed the waiter of the wait time and that my wife had a long drive home and proceeded to order our food. My wife loves the oysters and ordered a starter of oysters.  My wife was excited to eat at Boathouse because of their specialty oysters. The waiter said he would be right back with some bread and he would make sure to prioritize our order since we had been waiting a while. We thanked him and tried to make the best of our short time together. 20 minutes later (still no bread) I decided to go back to the bar to order another beer and refill my wife's soda since we couldn't find our waiter. Another ten minutes later the main course arrived delivered by another waiter. We asked where our waiter was (I was very frustrated at this time) and the new waiter apologized and said he didn't know where our waiter was. My wife kindly told the new waiter that our oysters had been forgotten and the new waiter went to check. A couple of minutes later our original waiter Lucas came out and said to us that he that he had forgotten about the oysters. My wife told him that at this point to just not bring the oysters out. We were already irritated on our anniversary and began to eat our meal. A little while later Lucas came out again and brought us some bread (as we were finishing our last few bites of dinner). I asked for the bill because we just wanted to leave. Another few minutes later our bill arrived and on our bill, I immediately noticed that we were being charged for the drinks that I had previously paid for at the bar. I showed The waiter my receipt for my drinks. He took my bill (without any apology) and a few moments later brought out a new bill that was correct. We paid for our food and left. On the drive out my wife and I had a discussion about the series of events and we decided that we would most likely never come back to Boathouse again. It's unfortunate. Not once did Lucas make any effort to try and make our bad experience any better. I'm the General Manager of a very big company in Santa Barbara and I would never allow my employees to treat anyone in this way. Customers are what drive a business like Boathouse and the employees are who make the difference. Unfortunately for Lucas, he has a lot to learn about how to treat guests and I hope the Boathouse can give Lucas the training necessary to become a better employee. However I believe at the end of the day, this wasn't a training issue but a ""employees lack of care"" issue.  We have happily spent at least $2,000 at Boathouse over time and we hope the Management staff can correct this employee issue before it affects other customers who may be feeling the same way as us. Great food doesn't keep people coming back. Great employees do.",1 star rating,Alex A.

It's a little more casual at the bar outside, but if you want fancy you can find it on the patio, as well as inside. The seafood is delicious, the service is excellent, and the location is perfect. We ate at the bar a couple of times, had the delicious calamari and a couple of other apps. All great!

My husband ordered the full stack of blueberry pancakes. Although they looked picture perfect they did not taste the same. I kept trying to like them but it just didn't happen.

The worst I have EVER received at any restaurant. Cups were left empty, sides of syrup and salsa came out after half the plates were eaten. 10 minutes after I started eating (50% done) was when the server brought out the salsa I requested.

Had their fish tacos - portion and taste were great! The fresh was really fresh tasting. And I got a Patron Margarita and they were not light handed with that Patron - which is a requirement for me to say good drinks!! It was tasty as well! My date was running a little late due to parking, they sat me and checked in no less than 3 times before he even got there. She was there to check in right away, he needed a few more minutes - but that's service!! And even from inside, in a booth on the back wall I could see the surfers and none of the crowd on the beach - it was kinda perfect. They are extremely dog friendly (but my dog stayed in the Bay Area for my road trip) - allowing dogs to dine in and outside. Steps from the beach, with a good amount of parking is always a plus as well. Definitely worth a visit!!",5 star rating,Claire G.
10/31/2018,"Colorado Springs, CO",I was quite disappointed with the food. My husband and I came here for a romantic dinner. The location is stunning. Right next to the beach and views are amazing. I ordered a blood orange margarita and it didn't taste right. I asked them to put some additional triple spec in it and when they brought it back it tasted like water. I didn't even drink half of it. I ordered the ahi tuna with wonton chips off the happy hour menu. The tuna was good but the wonton chips were not crispy at all! Tasted stale. I asked them about it and the waiter said that they are room temperature and that's how they come! We then ordered a brownie sundae. How could you get this wrong? Brown was crunchy and not fudgey and ice cream tasted more like ice milk. My husband got the steak and he said it was ok. I know I won't go back here.

3/23/2016,"Orange, CA","My husband and I spent part of our 3rd Wedding Anniversary trip in Santa Barbara (one of our very favorite locations in California to be) the end of last summer and had the pleasure of dining here for the second time. Once again we were not disappointed in the slightest with our experience. What does stand out most about this place is its gorgeous location right on the beach with a perfect view of the ocean. So if you're wanting a casual yet nice beach side ambiance for dinner this is certainly the place to dine while visiting this area.We made our reservation online well in advance with a request to be seated out on their patio area with a view of the water so we could watch the sunset, and that request was perfectly met! We had a wonderful table with a gorgeous view right up by the glass on the patio and enjoyed the ocean views well into the evening. We had also let them know when booking the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and we were greeted with well wishes for that and were also given a complimentary dessert at the end of the evening to help us further celebrate the occasion.We got to the restaurant early enough before our reservation time to enjoy their happy hour, where I ordered a blood orange margarita and the lobster and truffle mac and cheese, which were both delicious. All of the bar tenders were very attentive to us and kind enough to take pictures of us as well despite being busy making and serving drinks during that time. Once we were seated at our table we were treated equally very well by our server throughout the course of our evening, with new drink orders being offered and filled promptly and our water glasses remaining filled thanks to a large serving bottle that was left conveniently at our table for refilling, which is always important when you are wanting to just relax, take your time and enjoy yourself without feeling rushed, which we very much wanted to do for the evening.We ordered coconut shrimp and a seasonal salad that included watermelon slices in it (yum!) for our appetizers. For the main course I had the grilled Mahi Mahi while my husband ordered the grilled Skuna Bay Salmon, both were very good and fresh. I especially loved the coconut curry sauce & pineapple salsa that came with mine, it added a nice added element to the flavor. We chose the vanilla bean creme brule for our dessert and we really enjoyed that as well. Afterward we took a nice little stroll down the beach where people were having bonfires and enjoyed the sound of the ocean waves crashing on the shore. It was a very pleasant and perfect evening, we can't wait to return to eat here during another future stay in the area.",4 star rating,Becka A.

You may bring your dogs however, they must stay outside the restaurant. You may not keep them near you even in their outdoor patio area. They have you tether them in a doggie area along the side of the beach entrance which makes me a little uncomfortable when it gets crowded because visibility of that area becomes difficult. The patio bar wraps around so that you may sit inside or outside which is nice. The drinks are decent. They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The wait can be a little long on weekends in the morning but are well worth for the view alone if you have the time.",3 star rating,Bridgette N.
5/12/2018,"San Francisco, CA","This place was a huge disappointment. You would think that a place that has a 4 star rating and over 1,000 reviews could not be so bad, but it was. Me and my partner and our daughter came here for lunch, and waited over 45 minutes. When we check in about our waiting time, they tell us that our buzzer was broken and they buzzed us 6 patrons ago. Now I don't blame them for that exactly, but it wasn't a good start to every thing that followed. Our waitress didn't look very happy and I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, and thought hey she's a college kid, maybe she crammed for a test yesterday, but later I realize she really didn't give a dang, and maybe no one else there did either. We asked for our fresh food (oysters and uni) to come out first, but that didn't happen. Our burnt overcooked hard fish and stale chips came out first. Me and my partner aren't ones to throw a fit when we eat somewhere, but that probably would have been the best time to do it. We ate our fish, but towards the end, one of the fish pieces was so hard, you couldn't break it apart. Our also overcooked fried calamari came next with bland shishito peppers (why even put that together?). Our cup of chowder (probably the best thing we ate) also came out before the fresh food. We finally get our oysters, and as I slurped my three, buy there were so many bits and shell pieces, as if nobody took the took to shuck them properly. Why did I find so many shell pieces in my mouth? And then we asked our waitress if our uni is coming out, and she said we didn't order that, and that they also ran out. I remember my partner ordering uni, and it's hard to miss what he says, because he has a fairly loud voice. Again I really don't understand how that many things can go wrong in one dining experience. As amazing as the view is, and the convenience of being at such a beautiful beach, I would NOT recommend this place.",1 star rating,April D.

3/8/2018,"Gold River, CA","Fun place, reasonable prices for drinks and appetizers. We didn't eat a full meal there. We sat at the bar during happy hour and had cocktails and appetizers. Fun watching the busy bartenders making all kinds of cocktails. The nice thing about this place is it's probably the only place in Santa Barbara where you can watch the sun set as most of the beaches there face south. I got the impression they were many locals there as well as many people cheered as the sun set. Fyi you can only sit at one of the view tables if you're having dinner and there was definitely a wait so be prepared and don't come too hungry !",4 star rating,Debbie J.
12/10/2016,"Arroyo Grande, CA","Great location. We were there for brunch. I'll bet it's amazing at sunset. Three of our 5-top had the special Bloody Mary. Served with celery, shrimp, pickled green bean and a full strip of thick cut bacon. Very good. The first sip takes about 10 seconds to land on the back of your tongue with a zinger. The server was knowledgeable about which items were (or could be) OK for Gluten allergic diners. Eggs Benedict - paper thin English Muffins, thick slab of ham, one egg medium and one egg runny. The tasty Hollandaise was touched with citrus. Tuna Melt - served on thick-cut bread with thick tomato slices, red onions and a small basket of unremarkably OK fries. Corned Beef Hash - Tasty, but not actually ""Hash.""  It's served as separate chunks of Corned Beef and chunks of potato. The ""eggs poached soft"" were on the other side of medium (a tiny dribble of yolk in one and solid in the other). But the Corned Beef was really tasty. Water is brought to the table in tall bottles. There's a massively extensive liquor menu. 15+ different whiskey choices, 10 gins, a dozen good tequila brands. Inside and outside seating. Lots of umbrellas and heaters. We had no trouble parking, but it could get bad during peak season times.",4 star rating,Jim S.

10/9/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA",Bottom line; A nice spot to take in a meal  My wife and I came here for breakfast the other day with our little one and had a nice breakfast.     I had the California Benedict and my wife had the traditional.    It was pretty good but I was hoping for a bit more flavor out of the hollandaise - it was borderline bland IMHO - and the side of potatoes were very good with the grilled onion and peppers but a fairly small portion.      The service was good and the food was good.   Add a little zip to the hollandaise and pile on a couple more potatoes and peppers and this place flirts with five stars!,4 star rating,AJ R.

I always order the Chilaquiles...Slow-cooked pulled pork in tomatillo salsa, over easy eggs, peppers and onions over corn tortilla chips. Topped with avocado, sour cream, salsa fresca and queso fresco. Served with black beans...YUM! Pair that with a mimosa and you're off to a great day. If you're a chilaquiles lover like me, you'll also enjoy Cajun Kitchen's version...tortilla chips smothered with green sauce, jack and cheddar cheese, topped with 2 eggs and hot sausage, avocado and sour cream. The spicy sausage packs some heat, so make sure you pair that with a nice, cold beverage.",5 star rating,Shanee A.
7/21/2014,"Las Vegas, NV","We chose this spot for lunch based primarily on its location (it's literally at the beach) and requested a table on their patio. The patio is situated in front of the restaurant and is enclosed by a tall plexi-glass wall to allow wonderful views of Arroyo Burro Beach (or Hendry's Beach). You still have great views from inside the restaurant due to large windows facing the ocean. We called in a reservation that morning, but there was still a bit of a wait when we arrived (it was a holiday, so it was expected).We got a great table right next to the plexi wall, which meant unblocked views of the water. While waiting for our friends, we ordered Blue Point oysters (raw on the half shell) to start. The daily selection didn't have any of my favorites, so I thought I'd try the popular Blue Point based on the server's recommendation. They were served with fresh lemon and cocktail sauce. I didn't really like the oysters. Much more briny than I prefer. I was worried in the beginning since I'm a huge West Coast oyster fan (WA, BC), but now I know that I don't like the East Coast flavor.I went with the Boathouse Signature Breakfast ($15.95), which is essentially a Crab Cake Benedict. Two Dungeness Crab cakes are topped with two poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise, and served with avocado, pico de gallo, and breakfast potatoes. This is one of the best breakfast dishes I've eaten! The crab cakes were delicious, the eggs were yolk perfection, the pico was fresh, and the chipotle hollandaise really tied it together. Bonus: the potatoes were also tasty. Ruben had the Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla ($12.95): Blackened shrimp, asiago and Jack cheese, roasted tomatoes, and scallions - also yummy.Service was pleasant, the hostesses were nice and accommodating, and it was such a great atmosphere to catch up with old friends while enjoying the weather! I was surprised how much I liked this spot, but that signature breakfast is really great! FYI: parking can be tricky if the beach is busy, but if you're only going to the restaurant, there are a few spaces right in front that are two hours maximum and are avoided by beach-goers.",4 star rating,Amelinda L.

2/18/2015,"Pasadena, CA","This place is nice if you're planning to come to the beach and also want something to eat.  Parking is pretty rough so if beach plans aren't on the agenda it wouldn't be worth it to me.  There might be days where its better or in the AM for breakfast/brunch but the time I went the lot was full, cars waiting on the street to enter, it was insane. Since I drove up from Los Angeles we ended up parking 3 to 4 blocks away and walked there but knowing that I'd probably skip.  The food was nice for a late lunch but I take it where they really shine is brunch or dinner based on others reviews.  The place is nice and a perfect location on the beach.I ordered the Prawn Cocktail and that was pretty good.  I enjoyed that.  I also ordered the Lobster Tacos but I wasn't as impressed with that.  For $17 there wasn't a lot of lobster and the black beans were a little dry.  It wasn't terrible but didn't feel like the value was there.  Service started strong but tapered off quickly.  First they tried to deliver my lunch to my neighbors table and it took a bit to flag down my waiter to get my bill.  The two tables next to me also had this issue including one that was leaving shortly after I arrived, not sure where the communication breakdown was there.  The people clearing the tables were on top of things but outside of a request to refill drinks early on when the appetizers arrived no one came by after.Next time I'm in town I'm going to try Brunch or Dinner and see how that alters my experience.",3 star rating,Matt A.

One downfall is that they have limited table seating for the happy hour prices but you can just stand at the bar and get the happy hour prices. The drinks and food are delicious and the service was excellent. My boyfriend and I even received a free dessert just because it was our first time there! The views of the beach are beautiful. After we were done with happy hour the beach was a few steps away where it was the perfect time to watch the sunset. One other downfall is the parking lot can get very full so you may have to find street parking and walk but it's definitely worth it.Update: I come here all the time and it's so great every time!

4/21/2016,"Moorpark, CA","Started with the Signature Bloody Mary. Not only was it beautiful with the bean, celery, green olive, lime, prawn, and my favorite bacon :) but it was delicious!I almost always go for the traditional Eggs Benedict when it's on the menu, but this time I decided to take a walk on the wild side and have something different. I went for the BOATHOUSE SIGNATURE BREAKFAST: Poached eggs over house made crab cakes, chipotle hollandaise, fresh avocado, pico de gallo & Boathouse breakfast potatoes. Delicious! The crab cakes were fat, soft in the center, crispy on the outside and nicely seasoned, the hollandaise had a nice chipotle bite to it, and the potatoes were seasoned well too with a good amount of garlic (which I like) but not so much that it would be obnoxious. I will so get it again.My other half got CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT: toasted English muffin, poached eggs, black forest ham, citrus hollandaise & Boathouse breakfast potatoesNow I didn't try the finished product of his, but I did try the hollandaise before hand (I am kind of anal about that. We make it from scratch at home so if it's not right it's a no go.) When we tried it we both agreed it was a tad on the citrus side, but he decided to go for it anyway. From what he said and he is pretty fussy because of the flavor of he Black Forrest ham it worked really well and he was SUPER happy :) if it had of been done with a traditional Canadian Bacon it would have been a no go.Now if I could do a 1/2 star I would, but I can't. The only dock in point was the first time both of our eggs came out they were at that weird point of turning hard boiled, but because our server was so on point and attentive as soon as our food came out and she checked on us I showed it to her and she said ""oh that's not right"" took both plates back and in less that 3 minutes we had 2 fresh plates that were perfect.From start to finish it was a great experience. The view was wonderful, the staff was equally as wonderful and the food, oh and the Bloody Mary was great! Will I be back to try something new? Ummm Yes! Maybe lunch next time.",4 star rating,Elizabeth K.

Upon checking in with the hostess we were seated right alway. Although we didn't have an ocean view on the patio it was still pleasant with warm weather and the waves crashing in the background. Our server & food are the reasons for 3 stars. After we ordered our server did not check back with us until we asked for the check. The food runner placed our food down without checking if we needed anything... I would have LOVED ketchup and hot sauce, but instead she rushed off in a hurry.

8/20/2012,"San Francisco, CA","We stopped by here for a brunch before driving back to the Bay Area after a relaxing girls' weekend getaway in Santa Barbara.  Lovely location on the beach.  Unfortunately, the hour long wait wasn't worth it for lukewarm entrees that were served an hour after we ordered.Although our waitress was friendly, something must have went wrong.  All the other tables around us were served their entrees before us; even those tables that had their orders taken after us and those that were seated after us.  We might have enjoyed our brunch a bit more if it hadn't been for the crazy delays.  After all, the clam chowder was truly tasty with a clammy, and smoky bacon flavor.  But, that might be because bacon makes almost everything better.  My entree of Chilaquiles was also well flavored and the tender chunks of pork were braised almost to perfection.  But, it was not as enjoyable as it could have been if it had been served earlier.  It obviously had been sitting on the counter for a while.  The chips were soggy and limp mess and the everything was lukewarm.Next time I'm going to Shoreline Beach Cafe on Leadbetter Beach.  Less fancy overall, but the wait isn't quite as ridiculous, and on balance, the wait is worth it.",2 star rating,Christina L.

The lobster mashed potatoes was good BUT it was served a bit lukewarm compared to the hot salmon and veggies- $27.The seafood pasta was very good and they gave more than fair portions of scallops and fish- according to her/$23.We were very pleased with the food.

6/11/2017,"Berkeley, CA","We don't eat out a lot as my boyfriend is a chef... we've found most of the restaurants around here to be mediocre so we usually prefer to make something at home. However, we wanted to take some friends to dinner last night and decided on boathouse due both to its proximity to our house and the fact that we get free corkage there with my wine club. I'm SO glad we came here. Our server, Tony, was gracious and attentive from start to finish, and the food was better than I was expecting. Tony gladly opened our two bottles of wine, brought us all new glasses when we switched from white to red, and brought us multiple baskets of bread throughout the course of our meal (yowza, their bread and butter is bomb!) We got the grand seafood platter to share (totally worth it, though next time we'd probably skip the raw clams and ask them to double up on shrimp). I had the salmon entree with truffled potatoes and veg, which I loved. Boyfriend has the cioppino which he seemed to enjoy, my friend sent back her Manhattan clam chowder because it wasn't good and tasted like minestrone, but she totally devoured her mahi salad, and her fiancé was raving about his ahi. The only reasons I give 4 and not 5 stars is that I've found the hostesses to be snooty/rude on multiple occasions, last night they weren't so bad but you still get the feeling they hate their jobs, which isn't the most welcoming vibe when you're about to drop 200+ bucks on dinner. Im also bummed that their patio is not dog friendly, and lastly, though dinner seems reasonable for seafood, when we came for brunch was super overpriced (it ended up being about $60 for two entrees and one drink). All in all a good meal, the interior and patio are beautiful and the ambiance is way nicer than when it was the brown pelican many years ago!",4 star rating,Elliot H.

That kind of overshadows the mediocre food and hit-and-miss quality.Even going for breakfast means cold eggs and meh coffee. Dinner has fish that is not too fresh and most of the other entrees (trust me, I've tried plenty of them) are sub-par. However, fhe drinks are pretty decent, so if you're wanting a place with a fantastic view of the ocean (it is literally right on the beach) and you want good drinks, try it out.

I'm a hot sauce person and at most other places I'd have a generous serving of Tapatio/Sriracha/something else with a little kick with every bite. I did ask for Tapatio but only used it with one bite, the omelette was so flavorful on its own that I didn't want to ruin it. The bloody mary was also delicious, as was the OJ, which I could tell from the first sip was freshly squeezed! Though you can't expect to spend $10 bucks here, I spent a very fair price for what I got, and am so very happy I came! Definitely check this place out for a nice weekend breakfast/brunch with friends and family! I can't speak for the lunch or dinner options, but I'm sure they're excellent as well.. I can't wait to try those as well. Until next time! ALSO.. I'm not sure if they take reservations, but there was a bit of a wait during prime weekend brunch hours. However, it wasn't a big deal because by the time we were seated we were hungry enough, had a great view, and experienced fairly quick service. I wish I had a complaint, but I don't. 5 Stars!",5 star rating,Lauren W.

9/5/2016,"Cleveland, OH","Such an excellent meal and experience! We made a reservation for 7pm on a Thursday (we called prior to ask what time sunset was so we wouldn't miss it). When we got there, they were waiting for a table to get up so we had about 15 minutes to wait, which was actually perfect as we were able to take a walk in the beach, which I definitely recommend doing. What a gorgeous view it was of the sunset! Best view in SB! The beach was also so clean and the sand was so soft, a hidden gem. At dinner, we enjoyed the mussels and pork belly/scallop app.. Both were very delicious. Our favorite was the ahi tuna entree.. Wow. I'm still thinking about how tasty and flavorful it was! All for a reasonable price too! The service and staff were great too. Overall, we loved our night out here and would definitely recommend!",5 star rating,Taylor C.

6/24/2016,"Encinitas, CA","Boathouse is one of my go to places in SB. And I intentionally said places rather than restaurants because if it was just for the food, I would not be a patron. The view, ambience, and service make up for the mediocre food. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh because I work at a 5 star seafood restaurant so I'm used to getting great seafood at a discounted rate, but Boathouse just doesn't impress me. So far I've had the lobster roll, seabass, clam chowder, and fish and chips. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things? But then again, these are staples at seafood restaurants so they really shouldn't disappoint.By the way, the fish and chips were breaded instead of beer battered, which was definitely disappointing. I don't remember if it mentioned that on the menu but if you're like me and prefer your fish beer battered, then I definitely would not recommend theirs.Nonetheless, I stop here for happy hour often or when a friend from out of town visits. Can't deny its a beautiful restaurant, with amazing views, and a friendly staff.",4 star rating,Lianne S.

11/5/2018,"Clovis, CA","We were in town for Family Weekend at UCSB. On the parent FB site, this place was highly suggested so I cancelled another reservation I had made and made a reservation here several days in advance. We had not seen our son since september and my husband and I were really looking forward to taking him to a nice dinner. Our reservation was for 5pm. We were seated inside as they ""did not have any tables available outside"". The view was beautiful even though we could not be seated at one of the multiple empty tables near the windows. They were definately not very accommodating on our arrival. We ordered the crab cakes and lobster Mac n cheese for starters, they were very good. I asked what the most popular drink was, and was told it was the Blood Orange Margarita. So I ordered this. It was watered down and awful. I did not even finish it. Our son ordered a ""coke"" from the waiter. After finishing it, the bus boy asked if he wanted another one. He said yes. The bus boy asked what he was drinking, our son stated ""Coke"". The bus boy brought him back an iced tea. When our waiter returned we asked for another coke to replace the used tea. The waiter said ""oh, well we don't have coke, we have Pepsi"". ""Fine, bring Pepsi then, not iced tea!"" He tried to make an excuse for our son getting an iced tea because they don't carry coke"". It was crazy! Should not be that big of deal. I ordered the filet mignon. I asked for medium rare+. This being a fine dining establishment, figured they are familiar with med rare+.  The waiter asked for clarification whether I liked ""all pink"" or small amount pink. I said ""small amount pink"". When the plate came out, the filet sat on top of mashed potatoes. When I cut into it, the meat was completely raw on the inside. Showed it to the waiter and he agreed it was not what I ordered. He holds a small plate out and asks me to put the steak on the plate, which I did. He took it away to the kitchen. So now I'm left with a thin layer of mashed potatoes sitting on my plate getting cold. It was at least 10 min before my steak was brought back. I was expecting it to come back on top of a new bed of mashed potatoes. Nope! He brings me the plate with my steak and says ""here, put this back on your plate"". I was so disappointed! So my mashed potatoes are stone cold now.Well the steak was now a good steak so I ate it. After the margarita fail I decided to just order a glass of wine. We all finished eating and we were just enjoying visiting with our son. I'm undergoing treatment for breast cancer and have been going through chemotherapy. This was the first time our son had seen us since my treatments began. So we were just talking, as I was slowly sipping my wine. Shockingly, all the sudden the manager comes to our table asking if we are done because they need our table for another party. I was speechless! I had about an inch of wine still in my glass! I felt so embarrassed, not knowing what time it was! But when you're asked to leave, you leave! On way out I checked my phone and it was 7pm. We weren't seated and settled in our table til at least 5:15, so now I'm feeling very dissappointed at the way we've been treated this whole time. Across from us there were several tables that had sat empty the whole night! But they needed us to vacate this tiny table for 3? We will never be back again! You don't treat a paying customer like that in a fine dining establishment! So embarrassing!",2 star rating,Sheryl P.

2/5/2018,"Laguna Hills, CA","My daughters and I came to The Boathouse after a nice walk through the Douglas Family Preserve. We all wanted a nice cold drink and a light snack to complete our afternoon of exploring Santa Barbara and this place was recommended by one of the locals. The location is a definite 5 since the restaurant is right on the beach. We ordered fancy cocktails, an iced tea and ahi poke to tie us over until dinner. The cocktails and ahi poke were a solid 4 but the service was a 1 at that.  Service was horrible!  Our server quickly left the table after serving our drinks  without asking if we would like to order any food. We waited around 15 minutes before we had to waive him down to get his attention. We ordered one item, the ahi poke with cabbage leaves and it came out with wonton skins.  The runner was quick to correct this. I then had to waive the server down again for an ice tea refill since he never came to the table to check on us. We would have been more forgiving if they were busy but it was 3pm and the sad part is the restaurant was fairly slow since the lunch crowd had already left and the dinner crowd wasn't due for at least another couple hours. We would not have left a tip at all but ultimately we decided to leave something since the drinks and ahi poke were delicious. We didn't want to be unfair to the bartender and food runner assuming the server tipped them out as he should. The service is a huge reflection of a restaurant. It's a shame it reflected in our overall rating of the Boat House.",3 star rating,Leanne D.

There are also many dogs, as this part of the beach is dog-friendly.It can get crowded, so be prepared to wait for a table. Despite being a perfect setup for a tourist trap, it was not. The wait staff was friendly and professional. They did not necessarily encourage us to linger, as there was still a line for tables, but they were very cool about it. My steak sandwich might have been the best I've had all year. The steak was perfect.

2/19/2014,"Oakland, CA","I always hesitate to rate a restaurant when only ordering one item. So please know that 3 stars is really more like 3 1/2, and further visits might garner more stars. We arrived after driving 5 hours from Oakland and immediately got our buzzer-thingy. Totally expected the wait - it was a beautiful day around 12:30 at the beach. So I think we were told an hour and it was a bit less than that. It didn't matter...we were at the beach and there's plenty of seating around.  We both ordered the fish tacos - daughter had the fish version, I had the lobster version. I will say that I don't really recommend the lobster - not worth the extra $3 as it wasn't all that flavorful. I would also recommend they add more of the crema/salsa to it as it was pretty dry - they only put a squirt on top of the avocado that is on top of the fish/lobster. There's plenty of hot sauces you can add that are sitting on the table, but the crema is specifically made to go with the flavors of the taco, so please just add a bit more - or at the very least, put it on the fish, not on the avocado. Small thing...easily rectified. Atmosphere was lovely - we sat outside but you can't go wrong with either inside or outside as there are HUGE windows that are open inside. Service was lovely. Would definitely go back to try different menu items.",3 star rating,Laurie H.

Do NOT get me wrong, they were not bad but they weren't amazing. The coconut shrimp could use a better sauce or glaze. The lobster could use a bit of a seasoning to enhance the grilled flavor.

But a heads up for those who aren't huge fans of cheese in their chowder. We tried the lobster truffle Mac & Cheese & that was delicious! Truffle provided a nice contrast to the flavors. Warm & buttery, of course. Paired well with a bottle of local Santa Barbara white wine. They were nice enough to provide me with a birthday treat. After, we enjoyed some relaxation time on beach.

9/19/2016,"Burbank, CA","I've been here twice in the last couple of months. The first time I came here was back in mid-August when a girl friend of mine who lives in the area brought me here. I was a little hung over from the night before and ordered the corned beef hash. It hit the spot. The signature bloody marys looked yummy but I was afraid I couldn't keep just the corned beef down. It was a little chilly that day but the view from the high top tables on the patio was beautiful.My most recent visit a few days ago was with other friends who are from the LA area (local to me) and asked me about this place because they saw it online. I told them I really liked it and that the view from the patio was gorgeous. So they decided we'd come here for Friday brunch. I had the Boathouse Louie salad. We tried to add crab but the server came back to tell us they just ran out of crab. Kind of weird because it was only 11am. We were lucky enough to get one of the high top tables on the patio (it's first come, first served over there). I got a cup of New England clam chowder and the signature bloody mary. My one friend got the same thing, and my other friend got a wedge salad with chicken and a Moscow mule. I was bummed about the crab, and the bloody mary could've been better, the clam chowder needed a bit more salt, but overall I was satisfied with the meal because I was enjoying my surroundings, the view and company. After lunch, we walked the beach a little bit and then headed out. It wasn't chilly that day. It was perfect. I would definitely come back and try something else on the menu. There were many things that I might like to try.",4 star rating,Pauline M.
3/12/2016,"Santa Maria, CA",I've had this bookmarked on my Yelp for a while. We decided today we'd give it a try. It really is right on the beach. Prime location. Parking is a challenge but we found a spot. It also is free which is unusual in SB. We checked in with the hostess who notified us it would be an hour wait inside or out. There were four empty tables which struck me odd. It took them about fifteen minutes to fill. We noticed people getting seated from the street that hasn't been on the list and decided to inquire. The hostess had no answer just six parties in front of us. We waited patiently hoping the food was worth it. 15 minutes later we were seated. Our server was wonderful. We ordered the shrimp tacos and pulled pork grilled cheese. The shrimp tacos were probably the best I've had and I've had my fair share. The pulled pork was lacking. The caramelized onions were barely cooked and some of the cheese not melted. I don't think I would recommend or get again. Great idea but poorly executed. I would definitely come back. The hostess station needs attention but service is right on.,4 star rating,Aricka L.

3/9/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is where my wife and I go for romantic dinners in Santa Barbara. The view out the giant windows is simply beautiful. But unlike most of the resturaunts with stellar views in Santa Barbara, the Boathouse doesn't just rest on the view and give you crummy food to go with your beautiful sunset over the ocean. The food at the Boathouse is actually good. The quality is such that I've never felt like I've been ripped off by the high prices, you get food that is worth that much money.As a warning it is frequently crowded, so unless you really don't care where you sit, inside or out, by the ocean view or the view of the parking lot, make a reservation. And give yourself plenty of time before hand because finding parking is a bit difficult. Expect to walk a little to the resturaunt. We mostly end up parked in the overflow lot. The one other negative I can think of is that the menu feels a little small. It's good but there just aren't many choices. So if you go with any frequency the tastes are going to start to feel redundant. But if you treat it as the special place it is, you shouldn't have any problems.",4 star rating,Eben M.
4/8/2019,"Valley Center, CA","This place was incredible! Everything we ordered was delicious and the view cannot be beat. We ordered the fried calamari, clam chowder and crab cakes as appetizer and they were all the best we have every had. For dinner we had the sea bass and one person in our party had the surf and turf and it was out of this world. We tried his lobster and it was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was also wonderful and incredibly attentive. Great experience, great place, a must when in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Lizbeth K.
8/11/2016,"Anaheim, CA","I loved the place. It's right on the beach and the outdoor eating area makes you a part of the beach scene. It inside has these amazingly large windows and so there is not a bad seat in the house. Great menu..my wife had a huge bowl of clam chowder and a ahi poke bowl. I had the fish tacos and the fish was grilled, not fried and the portions were huge. I loved the guacamole and salsa...too bad it was in these little white cups. The chowder was the way I like it...thick, hot and generous portions of clams. The coffee was the best I've had, hot, flavorful and freshly brewed. One of the nicest restaurants in Santa Barbara. Two negatives. The parking could be a problem because you're sharing the parking with the beach crowd. The second is the restrooms, a men/women and a women only restroom. If you want to wash your hands you're in for a long wait. All in all I would recommend this place to some one that loves good seafood.",4 star rating,Gerry O.
8/12/2014,"San Clemente, CA","You can't beat the view and the environment which is fine because I always feel that the hostess and wait staff thinks everyone is a tourist and treats you as such. While the patio is the most popular spot, inside you get a more serene experience. We enjoy coming for the brunch items such as the avocado omelet which we share. Kids meals are good too including the kids breakfast. Bring your pooch and leash up outside then take them for a romp on the dog friendly beach.",3 star rating,Steph G.
3/7/2018,"Gig Harbor, WA","My favorite beach restaurant in Santa Barbara.  I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before.  I've been going for 3 years.  Sitting inside is fine.  If you don't face the windows, there are mirrors and you can still see.  But, sitting outside is the best.  We love to just come for Happy hour.  The drinks are great and the view...  Dinner is awesome also.  Great seafood.  Reasonably priced.  Be prepared to wait.  It's pretty popular.  And parking can be a challenge sometimes.  But, it's worth it.",5 star rating,Michael W.
5/17/2018,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I will give the Boathouse a 4-star for their breakfasts.  However, we came here to celebrate my birthday and I have to say, I was very disappointed in the dinner.  BloodOrange margarita - short glass, lots of ice, could not taste any alcohol, mildly tart but became watered down very quickly.  Beet Salad - 4-star.  Fresh greens, tasty dressing.  Bread - NonDescrip french bread.  Clam chowder - very tasty until you got to the bottom.  Then it was all potato.  I looked hard for any clams.  None found.  Sole -  again, not tasty. Very few capers, no sauce, a slice of lemon on the side helped.  Also - more potatoes!  So many!  Would have enjoyed a balance of the other veggies - literally only three julienne sliced carrots, 2 small cauliflower, 2 small broccoli.  Overall, we were disappointed in the dinner.  Will stick to coming for their breakfasts.  The service, though, was very good!",3 star rating,Jeanne F.

The service is friendly and professional. Just a great place all around.",5 star rating,Richard F.

6/15/2019,"Burbank, CA","Beach view restaurants are a dime a dozen in this area, but the secluded beach section around this restaurant made me want to try it. The small beach area was great, seeing all the dogs play while we waited (1HR for 2 people) made time go by quicker. However, the food was not so great, we started with the ceviche appetizer, which was very tasty, but the tortilla chips are clearly store bought and not fresh. My wife had the Cioppino and I had the seafood pasta. Hers had decent flavor, but I wasn't so lucky. I had bland pasta and shrimp floating in what is described as a ""spicy"" marinara, not even close. After adding salt, parmesan cheese and pepper a few times i got it to a tolerable consistency., but I regretted it shortly after. The prices are fair, which is why I didn't send it back and the waiter was very nice. The view is really why this place got 3 stars, maybe next time I'll stick to something more downtown.",3 star rating,Josias D.

I have only been here for appetizers or a casual drink-nothing fancy or anything where time was a true concern. That being said, they are always quick with the food, which is great! The food (appetizers) has always been great, no issues there. The drinks are great as well. A tad pricy, but mixed drinks anywhere are a couple dollars more. The bartenders are decent, but some are truly great. I've only had one instance where I didn't like my drink and the bartender took it back without issue and made me a new one.

2/29/2016,"Denver, CO","I ate dinner here last Saturday night with my fiance and his grandparents. My fiance and I were in Santa Barbara finalizing our wedding venue decision and while we were in town, he also wanted to show me a few different options he was thinking about for our rehearsal/groom's dinner. His grandparents, who live in Santa Barbara, had taken him to dinner here several times when he was growing up, so the restaurant holds sentimental value to him and his family. I agreed that the memories he shared there, along with the amazing beachfront location, would make Boathouse a perfect choice!Unfortunately, when we put our name in at the hostess stand, we were informed that the wait was over an hour and a half long. We had been busy wedding planning all day and were very hungry, so we decided not to wait that long to eat. And on top the long wait, the hostess also informed us that the restaurant is not able to accommodate large private parties, so it looked like we also wouldn't be able to consider it for our rehearsal dinner, either.However, as we walked back to our car, the manager chased after us and asked if we were the recently engaged couple who inquired about rehearsal dinner options. We said yes, and he immediately escorted us back to the restaurant to a patio table overlooking the ocean! And if that wasn't enough, we were given a round of champagne on the house! It was such an unexpected and unnecessary gesture, especially since the manager apologetically confirmed that they wouldn't be able to accommodate our rehearsal dinner next year. This was just truly an example of impeccable customer service, and we wholeheartedly appreciated it!Our waitress continued to provide us with excellent service throughout the night, and the food was incredible as well. The Grilled Ahi Tuna was one of the best meals I have ever had, and the blood orange margaritas were fantastic too. Portions are very large and well worth the $$$. The location cannot be beat. It was already dark while we were there, but I can only imagine that watching the sunset here would be unreal. We will definitely be back to the Boathouse on our next trip to Santa Barbara. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend for dinner, or even just a drink or two. I can't wait to come back for brunch as well! Thank you again for making our night so special!",5 star rating,Allison F.

Ordered the Signature Bloody Mary and it was to die for!  We asked for spicy and it came with a prawn, thick crispy bacon strip, celery, pickled green bean, pimento olive, lime slice with horseradish and a good amount of alcohol. The food is also perfection, we ordered the Signature Crab Cakes and Poached Eggs with panfried potatoes.  Fabulous drinks, food, service and atmosphere.",5 star rating,Steve G.

We came here on a Sunday for brunch around 10:30 am. It does get crowded and we had to wait an hour because they don't take reservations over the phone but it went by so fast because we still were able to get drinks at the bar and hang out outside on the beach. The drinks were amazing! I got a jalapeno lemon drop martini. The food was also incredible. I got the fish tacos and shared some chowder fries with my friend.

5/5/2016,"Isla Vista, CA","The only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars is because the service was not at all what I had expected. From the looks of the restaurant I would have expected for this to be a 5 star service level. My date had taken me here for a surprise birthday dinner and while the food and view was breathtaking, the lack of service would definitely be something that would prevent me from coming back. Our server, whose name we found out was Justin, from our dinner receipt at the end of the meal, must have been having a bad day or was too exhausted to work. I've never once had someone ask me if I wanted my birthday dessert, that was definitely a shock, especially when it was suppose to be a surprise. We were not greeted with a warm hello and to be quite honest there was less than minimal human interaction with him. I had more interaction with the host throughout my entire meal. The hostess however was exceptional, I never got her name but she was a brunette about 5'6. Honestly I would come back just for her hospitality. We had a reservation for a ocean view table but it wasn't ready at the time so we just sat at a regular table. The hostess however took it upon herself to help move us to the ocean view table as soon as one opened up even after we told her it wasn't necessary. She knew it was my birthday and she definitely did all that she could to make it special and I definitely thank her for it. I wish I could have gave this place the 5 stars it deserves but my experience here this time definitely did not earn it. Although I had a bad experience, the manager Katie offered to invite me back to give them a second chance and was very professional with the conversation that took place the morning after my meal. I'm definitely hoping our next experience will get the 5 stars this place deserved because the food was exceptional, the hostesses were exceptional and the management as well.",3 star rating,Joy N.

There were a lot of ""hostesses"" floating around - semi snooty, semi vapid, not all too helpful. Now on to the good stuff - Boathouse Signature Breakfast...HEAVENLY. The crab cakes were flavorful, creamy and full of crab meat - it went to the next level creaminess when I broke open the egg yolks. NEXT LEVEL! The potatoes were ok - they didn't really join the flavor party but the pico definitely helped cut through the creamy benedict.

So if that has a big factor in your decision making(and it should - sometimes ambiance is more important than the food); then this place hits the mark.Food wise - first big red flag - half of its main courses aren't fish. We're talking about a seafood restaurant on the beach. As for the courses - we had scallops and pork belly - the pork belly tasted old. Like it had been braised 3 days before and pan fried to order. You get this kind of finish from pork or most meats when they linger beyond a day or two. Our two mains were seabass and scallops. Both were solid dishes. Not terrible, but not memorable or even that great. It's like they were striving for mediocre and they hit it soundly. Nothing technically wrong with either dish. The fish was cooked correctly. Sides were reasonable. Portions were ok. It just didn't sing and at a price of 100 bucks between two people; you just expected more. At the end of the day; would I come back? No. Solidly no. But that doesn't make it a bad place depending on what you are looking for.",3 star rating,Ajit K.

7/18/2016,"Houston, TX","Excellent service, excellent view, and delicious food. What more could you ask for? Well, the one hour wait could have been shorter, but that's to be expected anywhere that's a good brunch spot on Sunday! The wait was totally worth it and did not feel that long since you can people watch on the beach, check out the para-sailers in the nearby valley, or watch the dogs play in the water. Our waitress was a sweetheart and let us try the Manhattan style chowder before we committed to ordering it. I'm glad we tasted it first because we didn't care for it. We ended up ordering the 1) shrimp cocktail 2) kale and orange salad 3) signature breakfast (eggs Benedict but on crab cakes instead of English muffins). All were fresh and came out at appropriate temperatures--the shrimp cocktail and salad well chilled; the crab cakes/poached eggs piping hot. The shrimp were huge, plump, sweet, and fresh. They came with a generous helping of horseradish that wasn't mixed into the cocktail sauce so we could make it as spicy as we wanted. It was quite obvious to me that someone is paying a lot of attention to the details and the customer experience here. I can't wait to come back to try some of the heavier options (lobster Mac and cheese, chowder fries (basically poutine but with clam chowder instead of cheese sauce)!",5 star rating,Thao D.

We didn't order anything fancy; just some breakfast burritos and a classic egg/bacon dish and the french toast.  the chorizo in the burrito was very good quality and by far, a great choice.  Everything else was good; the french toast was similar to how I make mine at home. The service was okay.  I think the food runners and busboys (is that still a term?) provided far better service than the wait staff.  I would have preferred to tip those employees over the one taking the order and giving us our check. One knock is that 2 people from our group ordered orange juice and, while a place like that should serve fresh squeezed since they are charging the price of a fresh squeezed, the juice was concentrate (minute maid) and each glass of juice tasted differently and looked different in color.   Neither glass tasted good and was not worth the price. The coffee was strong and good.",4 star rating,Cheryl D.
1/21/2016,"Brea, CA",So beautiful! Definitely recommend sitting outside to enjoy the view and the sound of the ocean. The food was so good! I had the Boathouse breakfast and it tasted so good. The crab cake was amazing and it fit perfectly with the egg and chipotle hollandaise that was on top. The Blood Orange Margarita was delicious and was a great pairing with the dish. I definitely plan to come back when I am in the area.,5 star rating,Amanda F.

I highly recommend checking out HH.",5 star rating,Miranda K.

Lucas, our waiter, offered excellent recommendations for both appetizers and drinks, and kept us thoroughly entertained until our sunset departure.

10/8/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","We were lucky enough to find seats at the bar while waiting (one hour estimate) for a table for four, but luckier yet to be served by Dominic, bartender extraordinaire! Not only were his drinks perfect, he smiled, was personable and appeared in no rush even as he and his co-bartenders were literally bombarded with orders. Of course the view of the beach and ocean were absolutely beautiful as always.  Once seated for dinner, the good service continued. The menu offers a very nice selection and our dinner was delicious. Unfortunately with the views came no cell service for us to get Uber after multiple attempts. With no one at the hostess desk, I walked back into the restaurant to use see if I could use a phone but instead Dominic walked us out to Cliff Drive where he was able to get service and contacted Uber for us! Talk about going above & beyond! The Boathouse has a great employee and PR person. Great evening but Dominic gets a 5 STAR rating from us.  Thank you Dominic.",5 star rating,Margaret S.
1/5/2018,"Thousand Oaks, CA","This place is all about atmosphere because the food is just okay.  But atmosphere is what the Boathouse is all about. Don't need great food when you have the beach at your footsteps, with amazing sunsets and pounding waves, but imagine if they did is all I could think as I eat the fish that just was okay. I've been here several times. I will say their drinks are pretty good!  And the bar is nice as well. Love the dog aspects of the area too.",4 star rating,Mary J.
4/16/2017,"Pasadena, CA","We drove out from L.A. to have an Easter meal at the beautiful location. One star for the gorgeous beach. One star for the lobster mac and cheese. Everything else was just meh. The aforementioned mac and cheese starter was quite yummy. Which is why it would have been nice to have been able to enjoy it before our main dishes arrived at our table, placed to one side because the appetizer plates were still in front of us. Strike one.Fish and chips- bland and flavorless. Didn't eat it. Strike two.Fish tacos. Not exciting, but not bad, so we'll call it a foul ball.Blood orange margaritas. Flavorless again. Strike three.Staff kept trying to take our food away while we were still eating. Waiter didn't offer dessert or coffee or bring us a dessert menu. We were there to celebrate Easter and wanted dessert, and we were NOT lingering too long at our table so no need to rush us out. We were delivered our check while the table next to us (different waiter) were ordering coffee and perusing the dessert menu that THEY had been offered. However, by dessert time strike three had already happened so we didn't push it and left.So sad. Love that beach. Would like to love the Boathouse too.",2 star rating,C C.

Sigh.Bar staff is great. Servers.....ummmmmm. Not soo much. I typically come for breakers and sit at the bar. The view is great as is the service. The ambiance is like, well a boat, albeit a nice one.My menu faves are:Chilaquiles with poached eggs and Ranchero sauce on the side. Everything is fresh.Breakfast burrito is good as well. Sans potatoes  (the horrors)Eggs benny and salmon benny. Again good and fresh.Kids menu is not good or a bargain.The wait for a table on weekends is abhorrent. Pack a lunch if this is your plan.

9/1/2015,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","Great location, good service, decent food, (unsurprisingly) long wait on a summer weekend. We rolled in at 11:30am on a sunny Saturday in August, and were quoted a 2-hour wait for a table. Hostesses seemed like they were uninterested in showing up to work, but weren't exactly rude. We opted to wait a few minutes until two outdoor bar seats became available, and sat for drinks and lunch there.We tried two cocktails - the Step in the Right Direction and the ""Hemmingway"" (sp) Daquiri. The former was nice and refreshing, being made with vodka it was easy to drink, but rather weak, whereas the daquiri was more nicely balanced, with sweet, sour and bitter flavors melded nicely and strained over ice (not a blended daquiri). Being a vegetarian, perhaps it's unfair to review the food at a seafood restaurant, but at least my dining partner ordered the Ahi club and enjoyed it. There were no vegetarian options listed but they are more than happy to accommodate with a vegetarian burger, salad, pasta, or whatever. The bartender asked me what I had in mind; I figured a veggie burger would be simple and good for lunch. With added grilled onions and avocado the burger was good, but not great; I don't think there was any sauce so it just tasted a bit dry. The fries with Old Bay seasoning were ok. Service from our bartender was good, I wish I could recall his name. He carded me, which I thought was funny because I'm 35. Prices are a little high, but to be expected at a location like this. Overall, I liked this restaurant and would likely return because of the location. It would be awesome if they could add a couple appetizing vegetarian choices by then ;)",3 star rating,Jennifer A.

Banana's were old and mushy, didn't have a good taste. Even Baskin Robins has a better banana's for their banana split. It's not an original flambé.

Sorry to say, I thought maybe they spilled some water in it on the way over to our table. It was super watered down. Definitely the worst Bloody Mary I've had. No seasonings and hardly any alcohol. I just ordered a beer and left it alone. My friend ordered California Benedict and really enjoyed it, I had the wedge.

We had a short five minute wait and were seated promptly in a large, cozy booth. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The motif is reminiscent of a nautical theme: whites, blues and wood, with gorgeous ocean views at every angle. We started out with some amazing bloody marys. Our bartender, Randy was phenomenal! He served up the delicious drinks promptly and was very personable. Our eats were incredible! Everyone at the table was satisfied with their meals. I had the Vanilla Bean French Toast. It was complimented perfectly with fresh berries and whipped cream. I also had a bite of the Santa Barbara Omelet, yum! And the El Vaquero was heavenly! It had some kind of smokey, chipotle cream sauce that was to die for. I wanted to bottle it and pour it on everything. This is a must stop if you want to dine how the locals dine in SB.

Why are you taking up a location on the dog beach if you can't be a dog friendly restaurant?? Maybe some other business owner would have taken advantage of the loyalty of customers with dogs especially since they are regulars at this beach but not this restaurant owner.

2/19/2014,"Bay Area, CA","I give this place 3.5 stars :)A friend recommended checking out Boathouse at Hendry's Beach during our weekend trip to Santa Barbara and I couldn't be happier with our decision to check this place out. We weren't able to make a reservation like we had hoped, so we ended up waiting for 45 minutes - definitely not a bad wait time for a Sunday afternoon, I assume. Decided to wait it out; we were sure there'd be a long wait at similar restaurants anyways. We also didn't mind the wait since it gave us time to explore the beach! Gorgeous beach - a great view for those who are able to grab a table that faces it. We made it a point to eat as much seafood as we can down in Santa Barbara, so we ordered, oyster shooters, the cioppino, and lobster tacos, all dishes we were extremely happy with. I've never had raw oysters before, so this was my first oyster shooter. I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I have no complaints about it! Their cocktail sauce was good and oysters were super fresh.The cioppino had a good balance of seafood and sauce. My boyfriend is a huge fan of garlic, so he especially enjoyed his lunch. I personally loved how they grilled the bread that came with the cioppino.The lobster tacos were tasty. Not the best tacos I've had, but it definitely hit the spot. With the prices they charge, I wish they would've included 3 tacos in my order instead of 2. You could tell that including a side Caesar salad tried making up for that missing 3rd taco.If you're looking for something fancier this isn't the place for you. Some dishes seem a little on the pricey side for me personally, but this is a great casual place to grab some drinks, eat some good seafood, and enjoy the view. I highly recommend spending some time exploring the beach before or after your meal!Oh, and bonus points for the cute dog hut you can tie your dog to just outside the restaurant while you eat!",3 star rating,Audrey L.

We all ordered breakfast food (huevos rancheros, chilaquiles, santa barbara omelette). All great but not amazing. Coffee was decent.

So I called at 1:40. Table for 6.5 People. Checked in at arrival for Great Wait. Seated around 3;20pm. Service was mixed. Bartender was very attentive giving my Daughter beer samples and explaining them to her. Waitress was forgetful and slow. Asked at least twice for things like bread - after waiting  2 hours for table with 2 yo it was brutal! Told us Cook was slow slicing it. Portions are 'French sized - in other words small. Clam Chowder was a funky  yellow tinged color and tasted equally funky per my daughter.  Fried Fish on salad was edible but weird - why do you put fish sticks on a salad?! Desserts are small sized now too and Cheesecake was awful! Cream Brûlée tasted like pudding and Mud Pie's 'new presentation is minuscule and weird!  Have to wait crazy amount of time for dessert to   Show up - 'new dessert cook' we were told. Started feeling sorry for waitress - she looked embarrassed. Next time we'll hit up Laxy Acres and eat at picnic benches on Shoreline. Boathouse needs a make over!!!

11/3/2015,"Buena Park, CA","What a gem! One of the best seafood restaurant I've experienced here in Santa Barbara. Parking is convenient and the restaurant is right by the seashore. Seriously, the walk to the beach from the lot or restaurant is so ridiculously close. I came after sunset, so I couldn't really see much of the waves, but the beach was still so hauntingly beautiful, lit by the moon and stars. Plus, your sense of hearing is amplified in the darkness, so that's pretty cool.My thoughts on reading the menu: if this was going to be my last meal on earth, I'd die a happy person. There are so many seafood options, it's really tough deciding. Highlights include truffle or lobster mashed potatoes, cioppoino, the sea bass and well as the delectable banana foster dessert. Yum! Our server Eli was also exceptional. He provided great service and recommendations (we ordered his wine, entree and dessert tips). PLUS he has great hair.This was nice.",5 star rating,Janine D.

10/29/2017,"San Diego, CA","This is the only truly beachside dining location that we found in Santa Barbara. Their Moscow mule was the best I've ever had. Service was good with a nice patio. Seems like they might struggle a bit with parties of 10 or more, especially inside where the dining room is small, so highly recommend you call ahead in these cases. The dining room has the strong smell of a seafood restaurant, which didn't bother me but may bother others who don't care for seafood. But that problem can be solved by sitting outside where you can enjoy sunset views and rolling waves.",4 star rating,Dave D.

4/23/2015,"Oxnard, CA","This is a  popular high-end restaurant in a  beautiful setting on Hendry's Beach near Hope Ranch.There is patio and inside seating, all with a phenomenal view. There si not a bad seat in the house,The service was beyond good, Dominick was pleasant, friendly and always available, a huge improvement from my last visit here. We were here for dinner and did not have to wait for an outside table under a heater at sunset. We had jackets.He listed the draft beers ""from lightest to darkest and gave an informative description of each. They offer a nice selection pf wine and specialty cocktails, as well.. We started with Oysters at 28.00 a dozen, half Blue Point and Half Fanny Bay, they were fresh, sweet, fantastic: served with the traditional  cocktail sauce and horseradish, and red-wine vinegar mignonette.  The Caeasr salad was delicious and huge, a plus for us veggie lovers. We also had a grilled asparagus salad with a panko-crusted fired egg, it was delicious and innovative, the best bite of thel night. We ordered the chef special Pan-Blackened shrimp with cheese grits,  I am a shrimp and grits fan; I have had comparable shrimp at a better price and the grits were dry like couscous, not creamy like polenta. It was served with Brooclini  which paired nicely with the tomato-olive sauce. The entire dish was not as flavorful and Dominic led me to anticipate.Though I would not order it again, we ate very bite The Bananas Foster for desert was indescribably delicious. We shared Oysters, 2 beers, two salads and 2 entrees, $132, without the tip, so we were out the door for way less than 200 dollars for 3 people and we were well fed and treated like royalty.",4 star rating,Kristi N.

12/24/2018,"San Jose, CA","Fantastic food but felt like a racist place. Let's start with the good part. We were a group of three the California eggs Benedict, salmon eggs Benedict and French toast were really yummy! The potatoes were crisp and deliciously flavored, but the reason I give 3 starts is because of the way we were treated. Our server was great, but it was the (host) lady at the reception to get us seated was really rude to us. We politely requested if we could sit at a table near the ocean, she said it's a 45 min wait, so we were ok being seated behind. Before we were even asked for water, 3 tables were free right next to the ocean. We  waited a bit, gave our order and then I went and asked the host if we could be seated at a better place. She made a horrendous face and Said ""yeah I guess"" and still chose not to seat us at 3 the empty tables but at a table in the next row from the ocean. While we left too, she didn't acknowledge us. I wont be coming back here for how we were made to feel less despite the fantastic food.",3 star rating,Mridula K.

Honestly I think their  chilaquiles are the best thing I've had so far. I would not recommend the pulled pork grilled cheese, I don't necessarily regret getting it, but I'll never get it again. Pork, BBQ, and cheese just don't belong. My bf didn't care for their hollandaise on the benedicts, but enjoyed their basic eggs, bacon, potatoes dish the first time we went. We'll go back, definitely worth it for their Boathouse Punch.",4 star rating,Amanda R.
8/11/2015,"Campbell, CA","We went to this restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday on Monday night. It was very busy. We waited about 30 minutes for the table inside. The view from the restaurant is great, however one cannot see the sunset, because it actually takes place behind the big mountain. There is a staircase you can climb on the beach to see the sunset apparently. We waited 45 minutes for calamari and oyster Rockefeller. Manager was nice enough to buy us drinks because of the delay. Our main course came in shortly after. Seabass and lobster mac n cheese were delicious, however steamed clams were very bad. We asked the waiter to take it off the check and she did. Great service and location. Make reservations to avoid the wait.",2 star rating,Tatiana B.

The seats in the booth were all torn and discolored and the water tasted really gross...it was as if they weren't cleaned properly. The food was pretty good, but there were very few vegetarian options. There were about 3-4 vegetarian options for brunch and one for lunch but there were absolutely no vegetarian appetizers, which, is lame.

Caesar salad and clam chowder were great. For my entree I order the ciopino with a side of risotto and they were both excellent. I only wish they could eliminate the view to the waves at night more and add some lights to the parking lot. I will definitely be back and would recommend it to anyone.",4 star rating,Art K.

Over cooked and Greasy porkbelly bland as could be, steak frites undercooked with frozen tasting shoe string fries. Services was poor and place was dirty and once again fly ridden.

10/25/2014,"Corvallis, OR","This review is just for drinks at the tables near the bar.Boathouse is in a great location right on Hendry's/Arroyo Burro beach. Since the beach is a very popular dog beach expect lots of dogs and some difficulty finding a parking spot (though the parking lot is large and free).I came on a Sunday during happy hour and enjoyed the blood orange margarita. The service is good and since it was hot and we were in the sun they kept us filled up on water.If you're vegetarian, you might have a bit more trouble finding things to eat here. One member of our group (a vegan) had french fries and ketchup. We had looked at the menu ahead of time and hoped to get the steakhouse mushrooms at happy hour as a vegetarian appetizer, but those aren't available until dinner at 5 pm.

8/23/2014,"Calgary, Canada","The Boathouse at Hendry's Beach has A LOT going for it. First, it started to win us over by that thing that real estate agents keep telling us is imperative: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. The Boathouse literally looks out onto the water with spectacular views of the beach, and the breaking tide. If that's not enough for you, the food was also OUTSTANDING. I had taco salad with shrimp and let me tell you, that shrimp was grilled to perfection. It was delectable, savoury and all kinds of awesome. Definitely a must-eat place if you're in the area. And if you're not? Maybe you should check it out anyways.",5 star rating,Kristen D.

8/25/2014,"Lakeside, AZ",We went here this past weekend.  We used to love The Brown Pelican and thought we would give this new company a try.  You sure can't be the locale! Gorgeous views and right on the beach.The food was only marginally good.  When it was the Brown Pelican the food was excellent. The service was good then too.  Here we had to flag down our waitress just to get our iced tea refilled.After waiting an hour for a table (after being told it would be 45 minutes) we missed the cut off for the Sunday brunch. The place and parking lot was a zoo.The New England clam chowder was so bad I didn't finish it. I had the ceviche. Nothing special and not spicy. The chips tasted like they were grocery store chips.Hubby had the poblano and mushroom tacos. He also said they had no kick to them and bland.Sorry to say this is the last time we will be going there although it is where my husband and I went on our first date (to the Brown Pelican).,3 star rating,Cindy B.
5/29/2017,"Camarillo, CA","I came here for a date night with my boyfriend after the zoo. There was no wait at all even though we came during happy hour. Our server was amazing and very attentive to our needs and asked us any questions we had. I had gotten the seafood pasta which has an amazing mix of seafood as well as a kick of spice, I am a person who does not like spicy foods so it was just enough for me. I also got the blackberry Mai Tai which was made very well, I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was just enough. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often!",5 star rating,Emily T.
9/10/2014,"Santa Clarita, CA","We visited the Restaurant on 8/28/14First off I will say a few things that you will see in every review posted about this restaurant. 1. The view is amazing for sunset. You get a environmental show with the ocean, sand and then the colors of the sunset on the water. It is beautiful.2. The wait times. I went on a Thursday evening and waited about 35 minutes. So I can imagine on a busier night the wait. But most good restaurants have a wait so this should not surprise anyone.Now getting into the good stuff. The food was outstanding, well cooked, presentation was great and the prices were in the comfortable range. Dining experience had no problems at all. The wine list was very good as well with many locals wineries making it on to the list. All of the things above would have earned The Boathouse a 4 star review. But the waitress Bryanne, made the whole night over the top. A GOOD waitress is not giving her enough credit. She was always around when you needed something, but not over the top. She would make honest recommendations about food and wine. Her smile was warm and genuine. She would stay and talk about the everything and nothing, with me and my wife, like a host or friend would do, more than a waitress. I hope that management read this and know that she was the best part of the night.",5 star rating,Mike S.

9/26/2016,"San Francisco, CA","It is rare to find a place with a spectacular location/view that has such delicious food, exceptional service, reasonable prices and great parking. But this place has it all. In fact it was so good that after eating here for breakfast we returned for dinner in the same day! In town for a family event, our large party of 8 arrived without a reservation for Sunday breakfast. We were quickly seated on the patio in 15 minutes. We had a similarly short wait for an inside table at our early dinner. Even though the place was packed inside and out at both seatings, the staff was always super attentive and genuinely pleasant. The waiters made great suggestions and the supportive bus staff kept our drinks full, umbrellas and heaters and window shades adjusted, whatever we needed was anticipated and/or if asked for was brought without a wait. The cocktails were well balanced. The food was fresh, high quality and yummy. The wide range of dishes we had pleased everyone - not an easy task! If I had to find a flaw, the Cesar salad dressing was bland and the chowder fries were a miss (although the plain fries were perfect). This place is really wonderful. I hope the Boathouse owners appreciate and reward its very impressive front and back-house staff who together made our experience so great.",5 star rating,R. G.

I went in here expecting a great view, mediocre food and service with an attitude, and was wondering why my daughter had even made a reservation at only a 3.5 star restaurant.Totally wrong! This place is great! Yes, the view is pleasant, but it's not spectacular. I'm a beach boy, and I've enjoyed many better beach scenes. The food, however, was really good. There were four of us, and we each ordered something different. Each one of us was very pleased with our choices.And the service was excellent! I was very pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the attention and expertise of each of the 3 or 4 staff members who attended to us. No exceptions. Maybe a few people who once worked here gave this place a bad rap, but I sure didn't find that now.

The clam chowder and Ahi poke are fantastic, but as I noted previously the entrees might not be the best.I would also suggest sitting outside because it is more enjoyable and the service seems to be a lot better.

5/12/2018,"San Jose, CA","I never ever write reviews but this is literally the first thing I did when I got home. I really thought I would love this place, however this was probably the worst brunch experience I've ever had. I came with a group of seven on a Saturday morning and waited over an hour to be seated. Given that it was Mother's Day weekend, we understood there would be a long wait. The brunch was really subpar for what we paid. But that isn't the point of this review, the bartenders and cooks did very well at delivering fast food/drink service. The customer service needs to be improved. It took over an hour for us to be seated, we shouldn't have to wait over 30 minutes to get our bill situated so that we could leave. We literally have to flag down our waiter to get a response as to why it was taking so long. All she said was there's a new system and then left. Since we had a group of 7 and the gratuity was already included, she didn't even stop to explain anything else and left us confused to wait on her other tables. We had to flag down another server to have him explain what's happening with our credit cards. He finally explained that the manager was coming over to help us split the bill. If they had just explained that their new system couldn't split checks, we could've just put it all on one bill -- which we did within the first second of the manager coming to talk to us. There was no communication of anything at all, which to be honest left a horrible impression. The manager really didn't do anything to help us and kinda was just trying to push us out. It felt like just because we were college students that they could just give us shitty service with no consequence. Not acceptable at all, I've never had worse service. Figure out the kinks in your new system before using it on a busy weekend like this. If you can't split bills, maybe just tell us right away instead of making us wait over 30 minutes? We already waited so long to get into the restaurant, we shouldn't have wait so long to leave.I work in a restaurant also so I'm very understanding when it comes to service but this was just ridiculous. The one star goes to the nice hosts, great views, and fast food delivery. Other than that, everything before and after was horrible. We're definitely not coming back.",1 star rating,Jessica D.

However, some inconsiderate customers bring dogs that cannot be left alone without yelping and crying in the dog wait area, disturbing the rest of the guests enjoyment. Food was fine.

3/15/2014,"Goleta, CA","I'm a local and I've been here dozens of times, and likely will keep coming back for the view, but not the food.A few tips: call ahead (5 mins) before you arrive to get your name on the waitlist. They don't take reservations so don't try and ask otherwise. Yes, the wait will be long - proportional to the weather outside. If you don't mind sitting inside most of the tables have a great view (but avoid the table in the back by the bathroom.)The good: the view and setting is fantastic. Gorgeous view of the surrounding bluffs, beach, and surf. It's the it-spot for sunset.The bad: the food is overpriced for the relative low quality you're getting (ie: the Calamari was rubbery and tasteless). Skip their mixed drinks and go for a beer. The service isn't particularly great, however I feel a bit for them in that they're all clearly very overworked. You may want to linger at your table and enjoy the view (it won't be your food), you'll start to get the stink eye from staff at about the hour mark.Bottomline: You're paying for a spectacular view, not amazing food. If you're ok with that, go for it.",3 star rating,Trent B.
12/25/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm from LA and anything by the water is a dream. The location is amazing. I came to visit my sister for Christmas and lucky for us, she lives right up the hill. We made it for happy hour just in time to see the sunset. I ordered the calamari and an ipa. The beer (I can't remember the name) was strong and true to its kind. The dish was good, but also a bit spicy garnished with a jalapeno, cooked onions and a spicy aioli. It wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, but it did the job. I didn't go inside because I was enthralled with the outdoor ambiance. I stuck out like a sore thumb, seated next to older wealthier caucasian couples but everyone was nice. Overall, I will definitely come back for the sunset and drink specials. P.s it gets pretty packed so make sure to get a seat before the rush!",4 star rating,Aysia N.
7/13/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I've eaten here many times and the food is good and the location stellar.  The Boathouse gets two starts instead of one for that.  Yesterday, a Friday evening, we waited for an hour and a half with our out of town and starving guests.  We expected a wait and were originally told it would be 45 minutes.  Many folks who came in after us got seated and we just never moved up on the list.  We finally left at 8:30 to find FOOD somewhere, although many restaurants were closing at 9:00 by that point.    Mesa Thai was so nice to us--prepared take out for us at 9:00 pm (their closing time) and served us delicious appetizers while we waited.  For some reason I truly believe, the Boathouse did not want to seat us.  I would never go there again without a reservation and sometimes (like yesterday) that just wasn't possible as we didn't know when our guests would be arriving.  I guess they can get away with this bad behavior because of their location.",2 star rating,Sue P.

7/30/2014,"Palm Springs, CA","Amazing location and restaurant! Found this place while making a wrong turn. Ate here on a busy Friday night, put in our name and was asked if we would like to go to the bar area while we waited.....Mark the manager came over to us right away and brought us drink/wine menus, took our drink order and in 10 min we had wonderful drinks in hand. Great service. This place was very busy, but you could tell that all the staff was working hard and making all the guest feel welcome and well taken care of. When are drinks where empty but a minute, Mark came by again and took our 2nd order and again bri=ought us our drinks right away. We where seated in about 25 min, which seemed to go by quickly. Got a wonderful table inside with amazing views of the ocean. Most every table has one! Our server was excellent as well, she took our order, I got the Mesquite steak and prawns and my wife got the Filet Mignon and prawns.  She usually likes it med. to well done, it was more rare than she usually likes, but the meat was of such high quality she loved it! I love mine as well and the prawns where excellent. Our server again was great and we never wanted for anything.We met a few locals while we where waiting and they told us we where lucky to have ""stumbled"" upon this place....and I could not agree more. Upon leaving I stopped and talked to Mark (I hope I remembered your name correctly) and told him how great our dinning experience was and that we where celebrating our 33year wedding anniversary and where very happy to have come here. He was happy to hear our experience and blessed us with a nice gift !i could not recommend this place more highly.... so much so we came back 2 nights later and had another great time.Thanks Mark and all the hard working staff at the Boat House!",5 star rating,K M.

3/21/2012,"Minato, Japan","Honestly, I'm fond of this place.  I have seen the parking get horrendous here, but I don't mind a nice walk in warm, ocean air.  More than a year ago, my sister and I were chatting out on the patio about how we had never seen a whale in the wild.  Yup.  Beach living for decades, and never a whale sighting to speak of.  Less than 15 seconds after we changed the subject, two whales breach the water.  We were then given quite the show, highlighted by thunderous tail-slapping and 10 meter tall spray jets.  The whales were so large and magnificent, it felt like they were less than 100 meters away.Since that amazing moment, I've associated the Boathouse with the magic and magnificence of Mother Nature and continue to return here for strong mimosas and delicious brunches when I'm in the area.  What a memory making experience.",4 star rating,Elizabeth H.

They gave each of us one tiny 1/2 oz of bag of oyster crackers. 4) The caesar salad had no parmesan cheese and the romaine lettuce was yellow. 5) On the bottom of the shrimp salad bowl was somebody's strands of hair.

We asked to get separate checks and were told we were unable to. Even though there were 10 of us. Food was very bland and very small portions. When we received check they charged my husband for three glasses of wine even though he was served 2 glasses.

1/20/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","I had been to the Boathouse many times and if it weren't for the amazing location, it wouldn't be that special. However, I feel as though my last experience here warranted a review of their customer service: So last Friday night, my date and I came here to grab a couple of drinks and watch the sunset. One drink turned into many and by the end of the night it was finally time to close our tab out. I informed the server that my card was already at the bar and she said she's grab it. About 20 minutes later the server came back to the table, asked what my name was and the type/color of card. I gave her the details and another 20 minutes passed. The server regretfully informed me that the bartender had mistakenly gave my card to another patron -- a frequent one they said. Luckily for them, I was on a first date and as such, kept my demeanor in check. So how did the Boathouse attempt to rectify the situation: 1. They spent over 20-minutes attempting to contact Bank of America at 9:30 PM to straighten the situation out. The thought was that maybe BofA could call the other cardholder and have him bring mine back -- this didn't work. Unfortunately, you can't really do much in this regard at 9:30 PM. 2. The manager then comp'd my entire bill (about $80.00 worth) and provided me with a $50.00 gift card.3. The next day (Saturday), the manager spent his own personal time to visit the local BofA branch, where they were able to leave a voicemail for the other cardholder. Unfortunately, the cardholder never called back -- all day! Can you believe that?Finally by Sunday morning (two days later), I noticed that the cardholder was in fact using my card and had racked up a few hundred dollars in charges -- ughh. So at this point I was forced to cancel the card and move on. Sunday night the Boathouse calls and tells me that the other guy brought my card back, but at this point it was too late. I gave them 4-stars (not 5) because they created the situation that was easily avoidable by reading the name on the card. The rest of the rating is because they did everything they could to rectify the bartenders gross error.",4 star rating,Louie F.
3/13/2017,"Chicago, IL","When visiting SB, Hendry's was recommended, mostly for its spot on the beach and atmosphere. My friends and I truly enjoyed sitting outside in the sunshine, but I was disappointed in my food selection. As they had a varied raw bar and seafood menu I opted for crab cakes and the ahi poke. The crab cakes had a lot of breading and little crab. The ahi poke was flavorless and served with fried wonton chips like you'd get at a Chinese restaurant. Both looked very good on paper but were disappointing in the end. The scenery is beautiful but I would definitely recommend sticking to basic American fare.",3 star rating,Meg L.

3/11/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Positives:The views of the ocean through the large glass windows are absolutely breath taking! Great place to go after or before a beach walk! Magical to go for a moonlight walk after dinner or a glass of wine and appetizer. Great appetizers, lunch and dinner. Fun, high energy happy hour (if you dont mind big loud groups of people and sometimes not being able to sit). Its very special to go during the sunset...go early and get a spot by the windows if you want an extra special experience. THE VIEWS ARE AMAZING and you can smell the fresh salty sea air!  Down sides:The wait can be 45 min and up to 2 hours on weekends. Happy Hour can be extremely jammed with tuns of sweaty drunk, loud 20~30 something crowd. It can have an overly LOUD and a very distracting ""bar like"" feel if you get seated by the Happy Hour section. If possible...wait to sit a safe distance from the crazy Happy Hour section and your experience will be positive. Breakfast is overpriced and oily. Also I noticed VERY expensive (up to $300) bottles of wine sitting in a hot window with only a thin plastic pull down curtain... I felt the glass of the wine cabinet on several occasions...and its usually very warm!! I feel sorry for the customers who buy expensive bottles of wine that have been sitting in the sunshine for weeks or months. Wine should never be stored in the backing hot sun...and wine over $100 should be kept at a very specific temp (in a special wine cooler) or it will damage the wine. The owner owes it to his costumers to buy a wine cooler for his high end wine...its unfair to let $300 wine back in the sun....",3 star rating,Trish D.
11/21/2013,"Portland, OR","I've come here many many times. I live and work nearby and my dog loves the beach so the location sure helps with the review.The bartenders deserve 5 stars. They are all professional and quick to get you what you want. The happy hour here is amazing. Most days 3pm-close. I usually get a $5 blood orange margarita and either clams or a burger. Their burger is extremely juicy and full of flavor. Do not however sit in the happy hour cocktail section. The service there is bad. The blonde cocktail waitress that is always in there has been rude to me several times and always messes up my order with no apology. I'm a server and understand mistakes. Please just apologize and fix it and then it's done. Happy hour, it's worth it to wait to sit at the bar. Say hello to Scotty!Non happy hour food is also pretty yummy! The wet breakfast burrito is huge and so good!! I do wish they would serve it with some sour cream though. The lobsters tacos and fish tacos are awesome for lunch too.Waitstaff here is hard to get a hold of especially during brunch hours. They are no where near the level of service the bartenders bring. Many of them are young so they might just be inexperienced and not used to rushes. I would give the waitstaff 3 stars but the food/bartenders/atmosphere deserve more.",4 star rating,Ally P.

8/18/2016,"Sacramento, CA","My parents recommended that my boyfriend & I enjoy brunch at the Boathouse while in Santa Barbara celebrating my birthday. We arrived at 11:30 on a Monday morning & opted to sit outside at a bar table. Our server arrived promptly. I ordered the classic breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, & an English muffin with a biscuit on the side. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. My meal was wonderful. The eggs were light, the potatoes were extraordinarily flavorful, and that was the thickest cut of bacon I've ever been served! I was disappointed by the biscuit--it lacked flavor and was quite dry. My boyfriend enjoyed his burrito but said it was maybe a little too wet. Overall, brunch at the Boathouse was a pleasure. The food was generously portioned and tasty, the service was attentive, & the location right on the beach was beautiful. I was happy to spend the first meal of my birthday there!",4 star rating,Mia-Aurelia A.

The first day it was totally packed, so we could only stand in the bar area for a couple of beers. It was next to a nice beach for walking, and lots of puppy watching! The next day we decided to try here for dinner... and it was so delicious! The food was expensive, but totally worth it for the lobster Mac and Cheese. Free parking- but recommend parking in the far left lot. Pretty tricky to snag a parking space up close.",4 star rating,Victoria G.

We remained extremely patient with our server, who took 20 minutes to take our drink order and at least 45 minutes to get our food order. She managed to disappear for 45 minutes while we were left wondering if we were going to get our food. We did, she said the kitchen was being slow-- we got our plates, cold food. I think our food was sitting there. It was good, however steer clear during brunch, it's just not worth the efforts. I'll probably never return, the attitude from everyone in the place really killed it.",1 star rating,Nita B.
6/22/2012,"Durham, NC","Chilaquiles--why don't you grace me with your presence more often? You are on  the  boathouse menu for their breakfast when you need to be in my belly every day instead!Well okay--that can't happen because I would probably gain so many calories I would turn into chilaquiles, especially since these chilaquiles were smothered in tasty tomatillo sauce and slow cooked pork.....Don't forget about the queso fresco too. Wow. It was just so so good and worth every little calorie I ate in each bite. Pairing that with the view you get sitting on their large outdoor patio that sits literally on the sand of the ocean, this was a perfect way to end my trip down to Santa Barbara. My mom agreed too--she got one of their large omelets and loved every bit of it. Their coffee was also pretty tasty and we found ourselves having to be good and say no to our 4th refill since we did have a long drive ahead of us back up to Sacramento. And if you are into people watching like we are, coming here on a weekday morning is awesome. All kinds of awkward business meetings to pry into, so you even get breakfast time entertainment!",4 star rating,Sarah G.

5/28/2017,"Atascadero, CA",My husband and I decided to take a day trip down to Santa Barbara and chose to have lunch with Boathouse. Probably the best restaurant experience we have had in a long while. It was really busy so my husband dropped me off to put our name in while he found a spot to park. I waited about 5 min. Before they had a table out on the patio for us. The wait staff was on point making sure we had what we needed without being to much. THE FOOD.....We started out with deep fried calamari which was so fresh and lightly battered. My husband had the seafood pasta that was amazing. The sauce was so good with lots of fresh fish. I had the fish and chips which were encridabley flakey and tender. The waitress noticed my husbands shirt that had a band name that she recognized and we struck up a fast convo. About them. All around a great experience. We will be back and will pass on the good word about an amazing spot to enjoy. Thank you Boathouse!,5 star rating,Jennifer M.
5/27/2017,"Poughkeepsie, NY","Beautiful location, breath taking and beach front. Outdoor and indoor seating, outdoor seating has a glass wall so the wind won't be an issue. Food is spectacular.

2/10/2017,"Chino Hills, CA","Where to begin?!! The gorgeous outdoor patio seating was fantastic and they moved an umbrella for us upon request. We came for brunch and were blown away! The crab cake breakfast special was to die for and we split a dozen oysters. Let me pause here because OMG those were the best oysters of my life!!!! FRESH! Delicious! I could go on and on! Definitely the highlight of the meal. We scarfed down the oysters and sipped on some Bloody Mary's. The Bloodys could have been a little thicker in my opinion, kinda watery....nothing to write home about let alone order again. Will definitely go for champagne next time. The crab cakes were moist and flavorful, wow I am craving them right now! Over all, this was a 4 star meal, only losing 1 star over that watery Bloody Mary. I rave about this place to anyone passing through Santa Barbra. Gorgeous beach, great view, excellent service and the freshest oysters I've ever had!

However the food was still good & service was excellent. We had the lobster tacos & the cioppino, both very good. Another cool thing is that if you come with your pooch on the beach they have a small area at the entrance that is shaded where you can leave your pooch chilling in the shade...nice!",4 star rating,Crystal W.

1/5/2016,"Beverly Hills, CA","The food and service are decent. We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon after walking our dogs along Hendrys Beach. The patio out front was filled with anxious, barking dogs waiting for their owners, so we decided to leave the dogs in the car (hey it's early January!) and we waited about 10-20 minutes for a table. The place was packed but we got a table next to the window, which was great because the restaurant is with the visit mainly for its view. We got the Seafood Pasta ($18.50) and a Lobster Roll (~$16-18). The pasta was delicious but came with a side of bread that was half burnt, and pretty oily, which I was not a fan of. The lobster roll was average size, topped with sliced avocado. The lobster was mixed with several different ingredients so it wasn't purely lobster, which was alright but not preferable. Overall the atmosphere and the service are good enough, and the food is above average. A good place for brunch or a laid back meal after walking along the beach, or somewhere to take your parents.",3 star rating,Felicia H.

9/10/2015,"Irvine, CA","I came here to have my birthday dinner and the food was delicious. The restaurant itself is located right on the beach which is super quaint. Everyone there was super friendly and my party even conversed with neighboring groups trading food recommendations and suggestions. This restaurant definitely has an inviting local vibe to it while remaining upscale. We ordered the cioppino, grilled skuna bay salmon, clam chowder and crispy pork belly with sea scallops. The cioppino was very good but had a bit too much old bay seasoning and would've been perfect had there been less of it. The salmon was moist and butter and just melted in my mouth, this was my favorite dish of the evening. The crispy pork belly was under seasoned and not really crispy enough for my liking but the scallops were goof but the overall dish would been so much better had there been more saltiness or some type of seasoning on the pork belly. The clam chowder was good but not something super special and notable. The staff were friendly and attentive.",4 star rating,Claudia I.

After playing in the sand on Hendry's Beach, our 4 year old daughter needed a good rinsing off under the shower which you can find at most public beaches in the area these days. After taking all her clothes off at the car, we thought it would be a quick jaunt over to the showers. We didn't realize until it was way too late that showers were only accessible by going in front of the restaurant in full view of all those seated outside as well as past the expansive windows overlooking the ocean. I wasn't able to catch up with the towel until the show was already over.

4/14/2014,"North Andover, MA","""Dinner with a view"" is taken to a new level here.  The restaurant is located as close to the beach as it gets, and the view is beautiful.  I was lucky enough to come here for dinner while I was visiting the area on a trip, and we had a table outside on the patio.  It was very crowded and the staff had to squeeze their way between closely placed tables and chairs which made for some slightly awkward encounters.The food was very good, although I thought it was a bit expensive.  The portions were decently sized and everything tasted really fresh. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share (oysters Rockefeller, tuna tartare, calamari, mushrooms) and I ordered a mahi special with a vanilla risotto which was delicious. We had to wait a bit for our table, even though we called ahead for a large party, but I can't complain about a wait when we were steps away from the beach at sunset.  Overall, it was a very pleasant dinner experience!",4 star rating,Alyson C.
2/18/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","The reason anybody goes to the boathouse restaurant is of course the wonderful atmosphere, getting to sit right on the ocean at hendrys beach. So it was very, very disappointing when at 4 PM we decided to go for an early dinner and were told that we could only sit on the back side of the restaurant even though there were numerous empty tables on the patio and inside. We were told that everyone would have to order entrées if we sat either on the patio or inside the restaurant. Three out of five of us were ordering entrées, the others were having drinks and appetizers. I think this was very poor judgement on the managers part to treat us this way. We had two out of town guests with us and we were all very very disappointed needless to say. Since when do managers/restaurants require you to order entrées to sit in certain parts of the restaurant? Especially in between the lunch and dinner hour?! Isn't enough that more than half the table were ordering entrees? Sadly this review probably won't make any difference in their policy.  I am a long-time Santa Barbara resident and I was very disappointed with the way we were treated. They need some new management/new policies around this.",2 star rating,Suzy G.

While I do find things I enjoy on their menu like the ahi appetizer and shrimp cocktail and the fish is always fresh, I just feel it could use a little more uniqueness in their dishes. I do love the drinks here and the staff is friendly and accommodating even at busy times. Sometimes you have to wait for a table at this busy spot, but it's never too long.

1/2/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","I'm in the minority re quality of the food, it seems. Either our tastes are more refined than others', or we had bad luck.  Granted it was New Years Day, and the restaurant was teeming.The chowder was thick as cement, and while I've never tasted cement, I suspect that's how it tastes. My calamari ( I'm of Italian descent ) wre unforgivingly soggy, served with spicy relish ( shocking !!!! ), and little peppers which looked like they'd already been chewed on.My friend had fish and chips.... The fish came in 3 small cigar-like rolls of too-spicy batter, with miniscule amounts of fish inside, accompanied by thin dried up somethings which might have been the restaurant's  idea of "" chips ""??  Don't know.Perhaps it was the cook's day off.The ambience of the place was cheerful; everyone was having a good time.  The views and interior reflections of same....very beautiful!

ON. THE.

The Crab and Artichoke dish was delicious, the spicy Mussels were great too! Flavourful enough without taking away from the fresh taste of the Mussels.

So I said we will sit outside. We decided to wait in the bar had a few drinks and appetizers.Closed the tab of about $100 and than waited by the beach.  After an hr they called us in and gave us a table right by the entrance . No beach view. We said can we please sit at one of your other tables that are empty. The manager (Adam) told us those are for reservation, If you want to sit closer to the beach you would have to wait an extra hour.If they told us we were going to sit by the entrance after waiting for an hr, we would just sit somewhere and leave.After sitting in front of the entrance waiting for food , I saw a party of 4 waiting less than we did and get the best table/view . I'm sure they didn't have a reservation because they had the little light thing that lights up when your table is ready.Overall bad experience from the beginning.Brought my mood down.",1 star rating,Jack J.
12/7/2011,"Portland, OR","This happens to be one of my favorite of all places in Santa Barbara.  I recently sold my home there and moved up to Portland, OR however, the last place I wanted to visit was here.  The location says it all but actually this time the food and service was pretty good too.  This is one of the ONLY places in SB that you can sit on the beach, have a nice meal and watch the surfers and the sunset.  Our server was friendly is not a little confused at first.  They had a list of specially discounted bottles of wine and the one we ordered from their list somehow was not available.  I wanted the manager to give us a comparable wine at that discounted price. It took a while for them to grasp what I was requesting and miraculously they found a bottle of the discounted wine.  A small snafu to start off the evening but after that it was lovely.  We both had the Maine Lobster special.  How can you beat it? A lobster dinner with salad and sides for only 24.99!  The lobster was cooked well although I've had sweeter. One thing they could have brought was a wet nap or wet towel since eating lobster can get quite messy.  Otherwise, it was a wonderful evening and I will miss sitting on the beach in SB.",5 star rating,Wendy S.

We waited 30 mins for a waiter or waitress and eventually had to get up ourselves and walk up to the bar window and order our food. We asked  a server walking by who was appointed to our table and he said ""no one, we don't use this table to serve guests."" When we told him that we were seated here by the hostess and we had been waiting for about half an hour his response was, ""Sorry there is nothing I can really do.

I'm more about the atmosphere & the company & having something healthy.  We've had lunch/dinner & happy hour. I must say our last party of 7 was a bit uncomfortable the clients brought their twin 9 year olds 2 dinner & the waitress really was not very patience with them. the children ordered 3 appetizers 2 dinners  each actually due 2 they didn't like the 1st ones & 2 desserts in addition 2 what the grownups ordered which included serveral cocktails 2 bottles of wine & desserts making her tip very nice even though not really deserved.

10/16/2016,"Ventura, CA","We generally have had good experience here. However, this last one was not. We had a family member visiting from out of town. Our guest wanted us to take her to a place on the beach to have a drink and relax for a bit. We had 2 small children with us as well so thought immediately of the Boathouse. To our surprise there was a table in the self seating outside area. There were 3 partial gone drinks so we asked the hostess if the table was available. She said if nobody is sitting there the table is yours. We sit down, get the children all situated, waited for about 5 minutes after that to finally have a server come over to tell us that there is a party at that table. They wanted to go down to the beach and the server was holding there table. We had to leave. Funny, I thought you could either sit a table at the Boathouse OR visit the beach but not both at the same time? Now I know. I will get my table, order my drinks, and then go back and forth from my table to the beach. We were treated disrespectfully, rudely, and the overall policy of seat yourself and first come first serve was not upheld. Thanks for embarrassing us in front of our out of town guest Boathouse.

4/2/2015,"Toluca Terrace, CA","I don't know why I'm surprised. Another bad food experience here. Always friendly enough service and kind manager, very nice runners. However, the only thing that keeps this place going is their incredible prime real estate. Great views and convenient after an afternoon of playing on the beach with your dog. The little dog ""cabana"" they have set up so you can tie your pup up in some shade, is great and very considerate. But I'm judging based on what a restaurant experience typically encompasses - food and service. This restaurant is on the beach, in Santa Barbara CA...you would probably expect some pretty great seafood! Nope. They can't even get lobster right. On every occasion, no matter when or who ordered it - it's sinfully overlooked. I do, however, have a weird friend who loves tough lobster and loves to chew it for ages...probably since he's given up chewing tobacco, so that works out pretty well. The food is just whatever/bad. Everybody's entrées came to the table at different times, with huge gaps in between...one person finishing the last few bites...another persons dish arriving. By the way, what's the point of putting a child's order in immediately after being seated - for it to a) come out completely wrong and b) arriving during the same broad, scattered time period as everybody else's? In fact actually, the most recent visit - 90% of the tables orders were wrong. We had to get up numerous times to track down every order of beer...after waiting politely and asking about it again, for 20 minutes, each time. Service is bad. Not rude, just bad. As bad as it gets. Each time. But hey, at least they're consistent! A very important quality in a restaurant. At the end of the last visit, they took some things off the bill, so they do have proper decorum when it comes to manners...at the very end, as you're about to leave. Would've loved to see that from the start. It is a very alluring place, very romantic setting. But if you're looking for a dining experience and if you have an interest in using your taste buds, I highly suggest elsewhere. Another tid bit - a while ago we tried the fish house downtown...horrible. They have the nerve to call themselves ""FISH house?!"" But then we learned they own the boat house as well...comedy. I love comedy! Two stars!! Anyway boat house, you guys are nice but nice and good are not the same thing. Some properly seasoned or talented chefs and better management could do wonders for this painted pig.",2 star rating,Laura C.
2/27/2013,"ID, ID","How have I lived here for 2 years and not eaten here yet?Sunday night was my first time - and it most definitely will not be my last. First of all, the location could be everything - it is so beautiful sitting right on the beach where you get amazing views of the sunset, the water, and just everything that makes Hendry's glorious.The food was fantastic! Absolutely delicious. I had the Pork Sliders that were on Hawaiin rolls and had smoked Gouda  - shamefully my date only had a BITE! The rest were all mine and they were delicious. Date had some type of crab ceviche type dish that he loved. YUM! Then we moved onto wedge salads, clam chowder and both did the Kobe burger for main course (it was just one of those nights - we planned on filet mignon, but got there and the table next to us had burgers so we flipped) - it was all so tasty. Portions were great and satisfying. Seasoned to perfection, and everything was delicious!The service was GREAT! They have really upbeat, and accomodating hostesses (a beautiful, younger girl was working Sunday night and she was fantastic!) that were totally understanding that we really wanted to sit by THE FIREPLACE! It's so neat; it has sand instead of wood and it's so warm and worth waiting extra time for. The hostess was REALLY kind about it - we've been places with a seat request and get total stink eye over it. Not here.The server was great too! Very charismatic and fast!Let me tell you - the prices were SHOCKING - we couldn't believe that it was so well priced for the location, the food and just were expecting to really break the bank on this date night. Not at all! A few of the items we ordered even coincidentally ended up on the 'Happy Hour' menu - so that was the sliders, beers, and burgers and we had no idea! GREAT prices. Even GREATER food, and yeah just this location is something else!",5 star rating,Danielle E R.
2/28/2017,"Los Angeles, CA",I genuinely hate leaving bad reviews....but I feel this one is needed. We came in as a group of 6 on a Sunday for brunch. It was a little busy. We were seated and our drink orders were taken. The server came out to take our food orders once our drinks came out. Once we got our food he disappeared. :/ We asked several different servers to call ours over and no one ever did. The frustrating part was surrounding tables were being taken care of in a timely manner. We finally called the manager over and he said he would take off the mandatory gratuity from our bill. We didn't want to leave him a $0 tip so we did leave some cash behind.....despite the terrible service. We left the restaurant and went  down to the beach. We had to have been down there for at least 15 minutes. We had to walk by the restaurant to get to our calls. A server that wasn't ours pointed us out so our server could run out and hand us our tip money back. This was absolutely uncalled for. I felt this was done solely to try and embarrass us. I don't understand how there was time to wait and then run out after us but we were forgotten when we will still patrons in the restaurant. This was ridiculous and we won't be back. Overall bad experience.,1 star rating,Gladys G.
7/1/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Long wait for an outside table, but it was worth it for the view - beautiful seaside location. One thing to note: depending on the time of year and position of the sun, the sunset itself may not be visible from your table. That was the case when we were there in June, but the atmosphere was great nonetheless.Very friendly bartender, great drinks, and good appetizers (try the chicken tostada-like things!). I had blackened ahi tuna with a mango pico de gallo and mashed potatoes (it was the daily special) and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. Cute, friendly and attentive waitress to top it all off.If you're looking for a place to have an oceanside dinner in Santa Barbara, look no further.",4 star rating,Zach S.
1/31/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Amazing!  Excellent food, fantastic setting. I recently visited the Boathouse for the second time. I had forgotten how great the food is!  Sitting near the ocean is spellbinding and you cannot get closer to the ocean than this restaurant.  The food and staff were incredible, too.  I will return to the Boathouse soon as it is now on my list of favorite restaurants.",5 star rating,Lee C.
4/4/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Some of the best food in Santa Barbara! The fish is always fresh (try the mussels!). The service is great. If it's just two of you skip the tables and go sit in the bar. Look for our favorite server, Alex, she is amazing!!! She is attentive, caring and all-over taking care of her guests. One of the best servers we have ever had, anywhere! The location and ambiance can not be matched in Santa Barbara. Trust us, my wife and I are true locals, born and raised in this amazing city. You HAVE to visit the Boat House!",5 star rating,Mitch G.
1/31/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Boathouse is one of my favorite places to grab an early afternoon drink in Santa Barbara. The location is perfection. Nestled away from State Street on Arroyo Burro Beach (aka Hendry's Beach), Boathouse offers a magnificent view of the ocean. If you can go for the sunset, you will not be disappointed. The atmosphere reminds me of the bars in Hawaii, relaxed & worry free.  The staff is fun & friendly. I'm not a fan of seafood, however, I've never had dish that I didn't enjoy at Boathouse. The drinks, of course, are my favorite (give the Boathouse Punch a try). Parking can be an issue and reservations are not accepted. Go early if you plan to visit during peak times.",4 star rating,Sarah H.
4/1/2016,"Yucaipa, CA",Food is always good here. The ambiance is great! It is located right off the water. Amazing views! I ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon and it was delicious! For dessert I had the brownie Sunday and the bananas foster. Both were great.   I went there on a weekday and had an hour long wait... I recommend making reservations.,5 star rating,Laticha N.

Sure the location is great, and the place is real nice, but the food was below average.Four of us ordered four different items and they we all below grade.

12/3/2018,"East Palo Alto, CA","This has been one of my favorite places to eat since I moved to Santa Barbara. The food is delicious! The ambiance is very fitting with the beach view so I never mind waiting about an hour for a table outside by the edge of the restaurant. This place definitely deserves a five star review, but the service needs to be improved significantly. Every time I go, I notice certain people are treated more welcomingly than others. There is a discrepancy between the interactions of some guests over others. For example, I was not greeted with a smile or directed towards my seat while other guests were chatted up as they were directed towards their seats by the two hostesses. Additionally, the best service I received was by Luis who checked up on my table and asked if everything was going okay with our meal. Our server on the other hand, only checked up on our table once towards the end of our meal to see if anything else was needed. There was another table near us and they were also not walked over to their table and they waited about 10 minutes before someone came by and finally greeted them. Their server had walked over to a table next to them without so much as a glance in their direction, left, and came back a few minutes later to take their order and offer water. This is upsetting because it seems this happens every time I go to Hendry's. I love the food so I continue to go, but when I think of hendry's I don't think about a well rounded, positive experience. I simply think, good food. I hope their service improves and would happily change my review to five stars.",3 star rating,Monica V.

7/21/2017,"West Covina, CA","My amazing bride squad took me here for the last brunch of my awesome bachelorette party. I really wish they had valet here but there was parking in the next lot which wasn't much of a walk. We waited for about 30 min to be seated and in the mean time we walked down to the water. What a nice little beach! We then were seated inside. We were hoping for outdoor seating but we were so hungry and on a time crunch so we took whatever came up first. The indoor seating was stunning! The view inside is just as good! The seatbelt strap seats were actually comfy too. Now onto the food!!! We ordered a bunch of appetizers and few breakfast plates. The ones that stuck out were the lobster man n cheese and calamari. Our breakfast plate of the crab cake Benedict was huge and quite delicious. The only thing I was completely satisfied with was the fish ceviche. It didn't taste fresh to me at all which is why I deducted the star. I'd definitely like to go back for sunset, drinks and appetizers.",4 star rating,Cat C.

My boyfriend and I had lunch here yesterday, and we had made reservations ahead of time (they only take reservations over the phone). We got there about fifteen minutes early, and the hostess already had an outside table ready for us! Bonus points for that.The food was average- I had the kobe beef cheeseburger and the bf had the shrimp and chips. They were good.. but pricey for what we got. I also tried their honey mojito, which wasn't anything special. The service was also average, nothing remarkable. Definitely go for the view and to take a stroll along the beach afterwards!",4 star rating,Alyssa A.

If it wasn't for the Manager being so helpful and our waiters being very attentive, it wouldn't have been a decent experience. I hope that they learn to accommodate larger groups without doing one card per table of 10-12 people.

7/11/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","The only really perk about this place is the location. Yes, the local is definitely romantic. But the food... not so much. My sea bass was DRY and bland; but their mixed green salad with tomato-basil vinaigrette was awesome. For the price, I expected much more. The waiter definitely tapped our table just enough so we could enjoy our dry fish and not feel badgered. So in short food is okay for the price.... and service was ok.  It was an OKAY experience.",3 star rating,Juliana L.

3/29/2016,"Cypress, CA","The last  time I went, I got  the clam chowder and the spoon I was given had obviously not been washed because it tasted and smelled like very bad HALITOSIS!Aside from that, my experience has been mediocre.  The food and drinks are overpriced for what you get.I've tried several menu items (mac n' cheese, sauteed filet mignon with mushrooms, salmon, clam chowder, pasta with clams, countless drinks) and everything has been alright, but not particularly great, with one exception.The pork sliders at happy hour leave me craving more the next day.  They are delicious!!!If it wasn't for that disgusting experience, I would probably give this place about a 3.5 (because of the attentive wait staff and nice atmosphere, not necessarily the food).",2 star rating,TJ Y.
8/17/2017,"Goleta, CA","I like this place because I can take my dog for a walk on the beach when I wait for my table. They even have a little area where you can tie your dog to when you're eating. However the servers were a little lacking didn't really come to check on us even though it was not that crowed, I noticed them talking to each other on the side. Though I would go again because there food was great. I like their lunch menu a little bit better than their breakfast menu. Also there view is awesome from the restaurant.",3 star rating,Linda T.

3/1/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Always a great stop-over if you're driving through Santa Barbara. It's got amazing ocean-views, moreover, the beach is very dog-friendly. We travel with our dogs quite a bit so this is an amazing treat. You should get your name on their list right away, there's always a 40-50 minute wait for a table. Unless you can squeeze in the bar area. The food is not bad, not the best. But it's the atmosphere that's going to get you. Paired with a glass of blood orange margarita... LIFE IS GOOD. I heard their bloody mary is really famous. My only negative remark is on their service. When I had told my server that I found 2 thin strands of hair in my ahi poke, he just looked at it and said he'll let them know (not sure who ""them"" is). That's it :D Am I expecting too much for wanting some kind of a consolation for almost eating someone else's hair in my food?",3 star rating,Valerie S.

I can't stop myself from having the chilaquiles almost every time, but the Signature Breakfast is also amazing.

Their Bloody Marys are glorious, kind of like a snack BOWL because you get bacon, asparagus, and a lil shrimpy. I decided to go HXC balls to the wall and order oysties  on the half shell all for myself like a champ.

Words of wisdom: Even with the heaters, if you want to sit outside during the winter to watch the sunset (the best time, pink clouds!) bundle up! You'll be glad you did!Its a great place to bring outta towners, hendry's is one of my favorite beaches here in sb, so its a two-for, walk off your dinner or work up an appetite on the beach!

No other businesses here and a perfect shore-walking beach in front of it. After an hour walk, we checked in early. They squeezed us in early even though there was a wait. We got sat next to the glass so we were able to enjoy the glow of the sunset for our whole meal. Dominick...I don't remember names well but this guy was flawless. Quick to greet, recommended what had to be the best dish in the house...the halibut with light crust. I got the bacon-wrapped filet with jumbo prawns. Medium rare was my temp and almost every restaurant gets it to me medium. As soon as I put a fork in it, I knew I didn't need the knife! I had a couple of blood orange margaritas and my wife tried a not so stellar mojito and settled for a great cab.  Had a mud pie for dessert and loved how mild the coffee flavor was. As perfect as the food and staff were, Dominick made our night. Love this place, we will be back!",5 star rating,Dan L.

8/19/2012,"Campbell, CA","I was looking for a nice place for brunch on the way back to the Bay Area after picking up my daughter from UCLA.  I read the Yelp reviews and decided that the view here would be worth going through the potential service issues, especially since others said the food was good. We got just about exactly what we expected.  They have the view, so they don't have to really care about making their customers feel welcome. When we were called to be seated, the hostess waved us to the ONLY table on the patio that had no shade from the sea of umbrellas.  It was very not, so I asked her if there wasn't a way to get more shade and she said there were no other tables available.  My husband asked if we could at least have an umbrella moved closer to our table and she turned and walked away muttering something.  We weren't sure if she was going to check or what, so we stood by the table waiting for her to come back (it was right next to the hostess stand).  She saw us standing, looked surprised and came back over.  We asked if the umbrella from the next table could be moved closer.  She seemed really annoyed with us. She went to get a bus boy and said ""can you just do SOMETHING about this?"" he moved the umbrella about a foot over from the next table and it made all the difference.  How hard is that?Our drink order got lost on top of that - and my blood orange margarita was pretty uninteresting.  BUT, the waiter was fine, and the food really was good.  yes, they were busy... But it's their JOB, and my guess is that they are always busy on summer weekends so they should figure out how to manage it.  If you go, you might as well sit inside where you'll actually have a better view than on the patio, unless you're lucky enough to get a table right by the ocean.  I do recommend the boathouse signature breakfast, poached eggs over crab cakes and potatoes.",3 star rating,Bev B.

My husband and I both had oyster shooters, we shared the scallop appetizer which was so amazing! And we both had the lobster! The bananas foster was good except the rum was a little overpowering. The downfall to our visit was the service. When we arrived the host stand was blocked completely by a party. Later on I realized that inconsiderate party was in fact employees there on their days off. Our server was just okay. We weren't completely neglected but she certainly was paying more attention to the table of employees and the other table next to us which was a man who was obviously a regular and his two ""girlfriends"".

12/16/2014,"El Cerrito, CA","I was all revved up to go to the Boathouse with my significant other last night. I went onto yelp's website of the Boathouse to make sure that it was listed as open on Monday night. I even did my research beforehand on the Boathouse's website and boy, oh boy, was I ready to order me some halibut. My significant other and I braved the Alaska storm that hit Santa Barbara County and approached the Boathouse from Cliffhouse Drive. We saw that the main parking lot was closed and we thought, hmmm, that's odd, let's park at the adjacent lot. Then, we talked through the rain to the entrance. We saw that the lights were on, and I was ready to get my grub on.Then, the busboy, a nice man in fact, told us that the restaurant was closed. We finally noticed on the front door a sign that said that they were hosting their staff holiday party the night of Dec. 15 at 7 PM.I fully appreciate that the restaurant needs to show their staff some love but gosh darnit, the only way we would have known if the restaurant was closed was if we had come here earlier this month and seen the pitiful printed paper that gave notice that the restaurant was going to be closed.I'm a little bummed that it was closed, but I recognize that establishments should close for holiday parties for their staff.  But more than that, I don't understand why the Boathouse could not have updated their website stating that they would be closed for a holiday party on this particular night. I think it's unreasonable to turn hungry patrons away when they could have provided other means of communicating their holiday party other than a piece of paper on the door. The Internet was made for information (despite what Avenue Q says), and some notification would have avoided this unnecessary heartbreak, not to mention time and energy.Overall sad face.",2 star rating,Andrew J.

I never had them before here, I didn't order them, but my girlfriend shared them, and then let me finish them as I couldn't believe how tasty they were, she is incredible btw. I've been back 4 more times in 6 months (not bad for being 90 minutes away).  Every time since I savor the taste.  She has tried some other menu items. Most recently the BC oysters were top notch.

3/29/2012,"Atlanta, GA","I would recommend this place for a couple of reasons. I'm going to make this short and sweet. They're right on the beach, apparently the south is dead and hospitality made it's way out west (sorry but the service industry in Atlanta could learn a thing or two from the ones I came across in Santa Barbara. Don't get me wrong because people are awesome in Atlanta but they went above and beyond here. If you don't like your job get a new one!) and although I would consider their prices to be a little on the middle to high range the food was definitely tastey. * Service was friendly but yes, sometimes a little slow. Everyone that I spoke with though that worked here was super nice so I was content being patient. * There is parking right next door but get to the beach early if you want to snag a spot. Otherwise good luck. * They're located right on the beach. Beautiful view but most importantly there's access to food, beverages, and here's the kicker.....bathrooms. :D If you go to most of the other beaches in SB you are not going to find a bathroom. I'm not a dude. I can't just go by a tree. lol * The food is tastey. You've got sandwiches, pastas, seafood....it's quite nice and I like the selection. * The place is really cute. White walls, bar that opens into the restaurant and outdoors, clean bathrooms, great view.... what you would probably imagine a nice beach restaurant would look like. It's not Panama City all wood bar, slingin' shots of whiskey kind of place. It's a step up but very chill. :)",4 star rating,Alicia W.

But it's a pleasant locale to have a Sunset cocktail and as such is very nice, just don't be excited by the atmosphere and view and order anything that it isn't very simple and really hard to mess up if you get hungry. The help is generally well-meaning, but frequently inadequately trained, and slow--sometimes you can wait an awfully long time for the food.

2/17/2014,"Carlsbad, CA","My husband and I heard good things about this place, so we decided to have dinner here on a recent trip to Santa Barbara. The location was a bit far away from our hotel and the main drag (about a ten minute drive) but we were hoping that the food, service and atmosphere would make up for it. It did not. When we arrived for dinner around eight on a Sunday, we drove into a dark parking lot near the beach. The lack of street lights and signage made it a hard to find since we were unfamiliar with the area. We were greeted by friendly hostesses and seated inside right away. But then we waited for about ten minutes before a frazzled waitress came to our table and asked if we wanted drinks. It seems she was doing her side work and maybe wasn't expecting more tables? We ordered ice waters, appetizers and an entree to split as she hurried off, avoiding eye contact, to finish her work in the back. We saw her putting condiments in a rack and working with the busser while we waited for service.About 15 minutes passed when we were served our seared ahi and shrimp cocktail by a different server. We still had no waters. The server rushed off before we could ask her for some. We waited to see if anyone would come by to check on us, or bring us water, but we were hungry so we dug in. The Ahi portion was incredibly small for the price but flavorful and good quality. The shrimp cocktail was good size but very bland, the shrimp had zero flavor and no seasoning whatsoever. It would have been great if they tossed it in a little salt, pepper and lemon juice before bringing it to us.We also tried the clam chowder, it had big chunks of clam and potato, but also very very bland, it needed tons of salt and pepper so we loaded it up with Tabasco.A couple was seated next to us and we overheard the waitress's telling them the specials and offering bread- we weren't offered either. Bread would have been nice with our chowder.We shared the Macadamia crusted mahi for dinner my first bite was hot, but second bite was cold and mushy and the Mac crust was soggy. I didnt eat the rest of it. We piled our plates on the edge of the table and waited for someone to bring our check. We gave this restaurant two stars because the service was mostly friendly but terribly unattentive and the food was overpriced and mediocre. When I pay over ten dollars each for two small apps and over twenty bucks for a dinner, I expect it to be prepared with more skill than a dinner I cook at home.",2 star rating,Tessa N.

The trees, cliffs, and ocean are beautiful sights to enjoy outside. The outside is such a fun place to eat dinner and they have an interesting fire pit to keep you warm. The inside is just as amazing as well. The windows are large and give inside patrons a great view of the cliff and the ocean as well. I can't describe the view other than breathtaking.The bar area is a bit crowded and right in front of the entrance. Perhaps a better location of the bar for patrons to sit and chat would make for a better flow of people moving in and out of the restaurant.The food was good. I had the clam linguini and it was delicious. My friend had the sea bass, but for some reason she wasn't too impressed by it. The coffee came out pretty warm, which was not as bad, but a hot coffee would've been better for the ocean breeze. The waiter also seemed to be totally adrift during our dinner and wasn't very attentive, but he might have had a rough day so I can't get mad at him too much. The place was very solid.

Just thought I could help you out so that your review is more accurate.My reply: Interesting - the waitress didn't mention the 3-6 part (and we were there between 5 and 6), and happy hour was only in the small bar area and the seating in the very back of the patio. Both areas were packed, so we had to sit in the patio dining area and wouldn't have been able to take advantage of the happy hour pricing anyway.

It was sweet yet tart , perfect for my palette! (free refills). My friend ordered the boathouse signature dish! I thought it was good. It took about 30 min for it to come out. I liked the crabcakes but not the egg. I ordered the mahi mahi salad. After tasting a bit of the signature dish, my salad was sub-par. But, I still enjoyed it.

You sit nearly on the sand, but behind clean glass panels that keep the wind and cold out, mostly. Or inside of you prefer. I have been coming to this location for decades, but when the Boathouse took over, it became all it should have been. The young waitstaff is actually well trained and managed (not usual in SB), the food, while not fancy is just great, and the experience is relaxing and fun.

First and foremost, the restaurant sits right on a DOG beach. There is NO parking in their parking lot as the beach is packed with dogs and their owners. It also seems like the spot to hang out if you're a college student. The restaurant itself is super, super casual, think shorts & a t-shirt. I ordered an appetizer (coconut shrimp) which was very good. I also ordered the seafood pasta dish which was enormous. It literally could have fed 2-3 people no problem. The portions are just so big. Considering this restaurant hosts lots of tourists, they may want to consider cutting down on their portion size or offer half size entrees as we can't box up the leftovers. I'm sure they throw away hundreds of pounds of food a day. Not sure I'd recommend this restaurant. It's very mediocre.",2 star rating,Noelle B.

Not too shabby at all.I love a good Boathouse brunch as well, great mimosa and bloody mary. They used to have the best Chilequilles in SB but the recipe has recently changed and I no longer feel so strongly about them.

I tried to reserve the specific table 6 months in advance and was told I was too early so I tried again a month in advance and was told an Oceanside table was fine but when I got there they placed my table in the back saying nothing was guaranteed.

He is racist 100% and when I called him out on it he denied it.",1 star rating,Danielle R.
4/2/2014,"WA, WA","Love this place. The eggs benedict are really good and with the view of the ocean you can't beat this for a Sunday Brunch. Take your dog too because it's a dog friendly beach. Last time I was in Santa Barbara I also went back a second time in the same day for their Lobster dinner special.Can't beat the price and the sunset was awesome! Good wine list and bar drinks make it a great stopping place. We used to hang out at this beach growing up, but then there was only a hot dog stand. Now you can enjoy the beach with an adult beverage and a good meal!",4 star rating,Judith C.
2/28/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I've been here several times. The food is great (I usually get the steak and my wife gets ciopino or some other seafood dish), the service is excellent, the views spectacular. The last time I went was on my birthday, and I was carded when I ordered a beer. The wife and I joked about me getting carded on my birthday and the waiter heard and we all had a good laugh. The lobster dinner was excellent. At the end of the meal they brought us a huge slice of mocha ice cream cake. It was unexpected, I hadn't been out to eat for my birthday since we usually cook something special at home. We thanked the waiter and enjoyed our decadent desert. When we got the check we were very surprised to find that they charged us for the cake. Once again, it was really good but totally unexpected because we didn't ask for any desert.  We had assumed that it would be free since when the waiter brought it out, he wished me a happy birthday. Weird. Nice meal though. Don't assume anything is free, even if it's your birthday and you get something you didn't ask for.",3 star rating,Paula R.

My eggs on my eggs Benedict were way undercooked to the point where they were like water. Asked for a new batch and the eggs on the second try were hard. Did not put nearly enough hollandaise on the first or second try, had to ask for extra. Won't go back here, not worth it when there are so many other places to go.",2 star rating,Matt U.
11/5/2013,"Anaheim, CA","Came here yesterday for breakfast and i fell in love with the view. We left our dog in the car since we could not bring her on the patio (only service dogs allowed) which is completely understandable, ate as fast as we could so we could take her out to dog beach. We have lived in beach cities all of our lives but this view was amazing. I had the corned beef hash, it was very unique but I really enjoyed it and my husband had the yogurt & granola, delicious. The service was non existant but hey, the environment and ambiance made up for it. I met such awesome people and dogs there on the beach. Today, I came back for breakfast because I had such a remarkable time yesterday. The bartender was super friendly, had great suggestions and was great for conversing since I was there by myself. I explained to him how I'm from Los Angeles but was moving up here Dec 1. and that I really loved this place, since I'm a creature of habit and this place could be my new breakfast place. I was sitting in the sun at the bar and moved inside due to the sun getting a bit too hot outside. I started chatting with the regulars there and they seemed really intriguing and nice, very diverse restaurant, young people, elderly people, business people, everyone that came to the bar whether it was just for a coffee refill or someone in town for business seemed like wholesome people. I ordered a pacifico michelada which are usually my favorites, 2 eggs, extra crispy bacon and a side of fruit. Food and bartenders attentiveness was on point. I was just sitting there finishing my beer about 9:30am, because I had to go back to Long Beach at noon and still had to pack my things at the hotel.Then the dreaded UNIMAGINABLE happened. There was an older man who was apparently the owner who just started literally picking me apart due to my shirt. I was wearing yellow shorts and a cut off shirt and sandals. Yes my shirt did say fuck off, I'm sorry, I'm not from here just came for a few days and came for a quick breakfast by myself to enjoy the sun. Not that it matters but the bar counter was so tall it completely covered my shirt anyway. There HAS TO BE a better more respectful way of letting me know I am out of dress code instead of the offensive and demeaning way he did. How dare you question my morals and principles in front of your staff and customers in your restaurant. I would've definitely understood if he asked me to leave because my shirt or whatever the matter was RESPECTFULLY, not only because I am in nursing school & ALSO in the restaurant industry and my husband is a GM of a bar on State Street BUT I am a human being, you don't just treat people in that impolite and rude manner. He said that his restaurant was a family establishment and I had to put my sweater on because my shirt was completely unacceptable, mind you I didn't see any dress code sign at the front and since i was 1 of 2 customers inside (the other customer was literally saying ""are you kidding?!""  to the owner while he was on his rant to me, and the bartender just stared at me and looked sorry for me). I was already on my way out, like i said just enjoying the conversation before my 3 hour drive to Long Beach. Nonetheless, I completely complied and put my sweater on, saying I completely understand the situation and respecting his wishes the whole time. THEN he just kept going on and on started talking about my hat, asked me what I was thinking wearing it and completely started talking about my ethics, telling me he didn't understand what was up with me and asked me if it was a Los Angeles thing. He mentioned that he was trying to entertain his guests and that my outfit was deplorable. There was no one inside the restaurant! He even offered to pay for my breakfast if I put on my jacket (but in a very offensive way). I'm sorry sir I AM NOT A LEPER. I did my best to comply and apologized even left your bartender $10 on $20, I even said thank you on my way out to all of your staff members because I don't stoop down to people's levels, were you trying to get a reaction out of me? Is that why you kept pushing the subject? Do you feel better about yourself and your restaurant patronizing people and making them feel humiliated? YOU set the example in your own restaurant for your employees and are the reflection of your staff, I can't imagine how they can deal with your snobbiness & incompetence. Sure, I wore a shirt with profanity, i apologized for offending you. I'm 24 years old, I am NOT your daughter and certainly did not deserve the insolent and uncouth attitude coming from an elderly man and bar owner like yourself. I know you don't know me and I don't know you but I suggest when taking things in your own hands, keep the brashness and arrogance out and politely ask someone to leave.",1 star rating,Samantha D.

The fish was so fresh, and the sauce was delicious. We will definitely be back the next time we pass through Santa Barbara.My only negative critique is that we were seated near the hostesses and overheard someone who might have been the manager reprimanding them about some scheduling problem. This probably should have been done in a more private manner.  We also loved the beach where Boathouse is located ecause dogs were allowed, and we love dogs!

10/12/2013,"San Francisco, CA","We are planning a trip tomorrow to Santa Barbara together with our two dogs Stewie & Lily (Yorkie). I was really excited to find a restaurant by Arroyo Beach - pet friendly beach. However, when I called for reservation in their outside patio (since we are bringing our two dogs) I was told that we have to leave our dog outside the restaurant. Unfortunately this is not acceptable for me. So, I called the restaurant the second time and ask for the manager. Mark answer the phone, and I ask him if he can accomodate our request since they are small & behave dogs. He unfortunately decline my request and told me that it's a health code violation for them. Out of curiousity I ask him if health code violation varies all over the state of California. Unfortunately according to him "" he don't know"" which I found somewhat baffling & bizzare. We live in San Francisco Bay Area and we can bring our dogs in restaurants anywhere there is an outdoor space. We also brought our dogs in several trips in Carmel by the sea and we don't have problem getting a seat with a dogs in a patio/outdoor space.

3/27/2013,"Danville, CA","On a quick getaway with my daughter, on spring break from college.  On a recommendation, we tried The Boathouse.  We were told it was extra special if you could be there during sunset.  Even though the sunset was behind a cliff, it was still a spectacular view.  (Which, by the way,  could be had from almost any table, indoors or out, though indoors the view might be a bit better.) Thankfully I thought to make reservations--we were there on a Tuesday night and it was hopping!  Noise level is high, but not bothersome. Service was a little slow, but friendly, and who cared--look at the view!You are served a big slab of delicious sourdough bread while you wait.   We each ordered fresh fish meals and both were very tasty.  Decided to go wild and share a Molten Lava Cake and a Creme Brûlée.  Both were reasonable serving sizes and well worth the splurge. Our only complaint was having to ask for our waters to be filled a couple of times.  They should fix this. We will go back next time we're here, maybe try breakfast or lunch too.",5 star rating,Lisa H.

We have ordered a bottle of white wine. A waiter brought it in, the wine was absolutely warm. I said, that would you please give us a cold bottle. He answered: ""I will put the wine and in a wine cooler and it will chill the wine down"". I mean, everybody knows, that the wine cooler can not chill the wine it can just keep it's temperature as is, so it was a misleading. After that the guy has disappeared for about 20 min.I would have left the place, since I do not like to make a scandal .... but the problem was I gave them my Groupon voucher so we were stacked over there.In a huge while another guy came in, I said that we are not going to drink warm white wine. So,  he took the opened bottle and replace it with a cold one. It took him another 30 min. Finally we were able to drink the wine and the new waiter started taking our order for food.He took just my order and left without asking the rest of our party :). I had to call him to get back to us.Finally they delivered our food, but they did not give us any silverware.

However, it took nearly 35 minutes just to get an appetizer (oysters). Our  entree took incredibly long, and when finally received our meal, it was wrong. So they had to give us another steak, which took forever as well. The restaurant was busy, but not THAT busy.We had the clam chowder. It tasted more like bacon chowder. But it did have a lot of fresh tender clams. So if you love bacon, I recommend it. I had the cioppino and it was good. My friend had the seafood penne pasta and it was decent. Since we waited so long, we filled up on bread and was already somewhat full when our entree came and really couldn't enjoy our entree.I really would have loved to give this restaurant a better review, but 3 stars is generous.

Friendly, down to earth, happy and relaxed but at the same time aware of everything happening around him and he showed the most detail and care when making my drink. He is a true service professional! I was debating on dinner but just ordered another one instead. The open bar and ocean view was the perfect atmosphere.",5 star rating,Jade F.

Great improvements:) Definitely suggest the clam chowder fries and fried calamari. 2nd, and most important: Mike M. (I asked because mike is a popular name and I wanted to make sure he got credit for his awesome-ness.. anyway,) showed us the best service! We were treated like royalty. He was attentive but not crowding, had a great knowledge of the menu for food and drinks. Very professional but also super personable. Good looking dude, which doesnt hurt, and great server. If his service reflects the rest of the staff, we will be back! Don't really need to mention the food, because it's always on point. Amazing seafood!",5 star rating,Sarah M.

I was determine to not let the manager & bartender ruin my breakfast with my husband. I don't know that I have ever been subject to a more immature, unprofessional manager in my life, especially at a restaurant of this level. Food was pretty good but nothing fantastic. The manager was sitting in the corner of the restaurant using a paper cutter to cut the Valentine's Day fliers for the entire duration of our breakfast and bantering with the bartender & managing staff matters.

AT ALL.  We were told by locals to come to this restaurant and thought the location on the beach was ideal.  That's the only ideal thing about the restaurant.We waited over 30 minutes for our food to arrive and it was warm at best - and you knew it had been sitting under a heat lamp as everything was limp and chewy or overcooked.  Our server didn't check on us even once during the awful meal and three out of four of us did not eat more then a few bites of our food.  When the server finally came to the table we commented on how poor everything was, he replied, ""Oh, um... I'll tell someone."" Nothing else.  Seriously no customer service training there.  We couldn't stand to be in the restaurant another minute, so we paid (yes, we did pay for this terrible meal) and promptly left.  Literally, this restaurant experience left a bad taste in our mouths.",1 star rating,Elease L.

6/9/2010,"Orange County, CA","The girls and I took a random road trip to Santa Barbara, and we decided to be adventurous and Yelp random places.  By the time we were done window shopping and grubbing away, we decided to grab dessert and drinks at a scenic location.I typed in ""view"" and ""dessert"" into my mobile Yelp app, and Boat House came out on top of the list.  Granted, it had a pretty mediocre star rating.  Yet, none of the other choices that came out on the list had great ratings either.We were on an adventure, so we figured, ""Why not?"" and drove on over.The ride there was pretty scary.  Despite GPS navi, we missed the driveway to the restaurant and had to make a scary U-Turn in the middle of a seriously dark mountainous road.  Scary stuff.Anyway, we managed to park and moseyed our way into the restaurant and...WE HAD THE BEST TIME EVER!The outdoor patio was super happening on a Sunday night, and despite the fact that it was dark (therefore the view was just whatevers), the setting was so cozy and intimate!  Each table was lighted by a single candle, and despite the chilly ocean breeze, the ABUNDANCE of heat lamps (literally one by every table) kept us from freezing our butts off.  In fact, it was quite toasty and pleasant.I really have to note here that the servers are ADORABLE.  Talk about eye candy.  Sure, they were probably all seriously young, but they served as great eye candy nonetheless.  Who doesn't like being served by a cute, healthy, strapping young man?  LOL I sound like a cougar.Based on the reviews that I skimmed through before deciding on Boat House, I didn't have any expectations of the food.  I went there expecting mediocre food but great ambiance.The great ambiance was obvious from the get-go, but like I said, I hadn't any expectations of the food.  We got our dessert menus, and frankly, there weren't that many choices.  We opted to share a bananas foster and a macadamia nut mudd pie.  We also ordered one chocolate martini.I'm not a fan of martinis in general, so I didn't drink, but I took a sip and it was okay.  Again, not a fan of martinis, and definitely not a fan of chocolate martinis.  The drink did come with little chocolate shavings which I thought were tasty, but the drink was whatever.  The nice part, though, was that the drink was CHEAP.  It was under $10, and that was unexpected given the ambiance.Now onto the best part.  When the desserts came out, the three of us nearly fainted from shock.  HOLY COW!  They were HUGE portions, and plated BEAUTIFULLY!But even better.. THEY PASSED THE TASTE TEST!  Remember, I thought the food here would taste like crap, but I guess desserts don't count as food or something... because these desserts were DECADENT!!!  Totally worth the $8 we paid for each!  We got MORE than our money's worth, both in taste and quantity!Keep in mind, the indoor dining is sort of lame compared to how nice the patio is.  I wouldn't bother going inside, because it looks like a glorified diner.  The outside patio and the dessert menu is really the Boat House's crowning glory.All in all, we can't WAIT to make another trip out to Santa Barbara.  This time, we plan on going here for LUNCH so that we can enjoy the view, too!",5 star rating,Cat K.
10/3/2009,"Brooklyn, NY","Came here after hiking 10 miles down the beach on a sunny day.  Famished, over heated, and exhausted my only criteria for a good meal were proximity, speed, and being relatively edible.  Boat House only fulfilled one of three - they are located right on the beach.  Sadly, they blew at even satisfying a starving person, particularly a starving person who usually consumes her entire meal regardless of quality or social propriety.Pretty much every part of the meal sent me deeper and deeper into the depths of hell.  The calamari appetizer was pale and limp (that's what she said), my seared ahi club was completely inedible, and my hub's kobe beef burger was dry.  The only thing that exceeded the food in suck-itude was the service - who would have thought towheaded frat boys from nearby UCSB wouldn't make the best waiters?*Go here for the view.....or better yet just sit on the beach and enjoy it.*Anyone with two braincells",1 star rating,Sarah M.

We also had some oysters on the shell as an appetizers which were Okay. For desert we had 2 chocolate strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a chocolate shaped heart.

When we arrived i put my name down on the waiting list that was suppose to be an hr. I figured sir at the bar and have a couple of drinks with appetizers which is what we did. For the next 45 mins 8 tables remained vacant that was large enough to accommodate the 2 of us. as more and more tables started to clear I decided we weren't getting a table when we started walking out the gentleman acted as if nothing ever happened I was highly disappointed... a nice evening down the drain because they didn't want to serve us respectfully.

The fish was overcooked, the potatoes were lumpy red mashed garlic potatoes.The service was ok, but they forgot we were celebrating a birthday and we decided not to remind them because we have had enough. the tables seem long so it's not very cozy to talk to your group.

We had already received our food and he was nowhere to be found, and I had no one to talk to about my food being wrong. I had taken two bites from my burger. I asked if it could be re-done, he responded with ""next time tell me sooner"". Really? (He swore he worked in a DMV office or something)My burger came back cooked to my desired doneness but the horrible waiter apparently ended his shift and didn't bother turning over the table.

I wish I could give it 2.5 stars.The Good+ The location is obviously fantastic with the great views and proximity to the beach.+ You generally don't have to wait+ It's better than the brown pelican was, though that's not really much of a complimentThe Mixed= Some of the food is more than decent, but some of it is super bland. I recommend the breakfast over all else.  = The cost to quality of food ratio is certainly off but the locale makes up for this a bit. You are paying more for the view than the food.The Bad- Service varies between tepid and snobby and is consistently slow. Seems like they hired a bunch of kids from Hope Ranch that look good but serve poorly. They often forget drinks, you know, the bread and butter of a server's tips, and the food arrives in fits and starts. I've had to ask for my over priced alcoholic breakfast drink TWICE before. - Parking sucks on days with nice weather and who wants to come here when it's foggy? I know they can't do anything about it but if they get the bonus of the view they get the ding of terrible parking.Overall if you are in the mood for breakfast on the beach and don't mind paying extra then go for it. If you want a good breakfast then look elsewhere.",2 star rating,Thomas P.

It took a long time get our party of five seated, even though there were several table available. I figured we would be getting a booth due to the odd number in our party, but when finally seated, we got one of the square tables. Really not sure why they couldn't have seated us earlier since there were many open tables prior to our seating. The waitstaff, as Russ E pointed out was terrible. Our waiter, looked at our table, and walked away. Another waitstaff had to come over and take drink orders. When the waiter finally decided to grace us with his presence, he didn't even bother to ask how I wanted my eggs prepared on my order of corned beef hash (flavorless, dry, and too fatty btw). He did get the order of dry wheat toast right, thank goodness for small favors! Kudos to the busboy for refilling drinks, the waiter seemed to do it only when he felt like it. The only time our waiter was ever prompt was when he was bringing us the check. I guess this place used to be called the Brown Pelican before it became the Boat House. To me, it will forever be a over-hyped Denny's with terrible waitstaff.",1 star rating,Jen S.

Well, there's a first for everything, and today was that day. Me and the GF drove out to Santa Barbara to have lunch with her mom, The Boat House was to be our eatery of choice. The locale is pretty awesome, the place is on the beach literally. You walk out, and bam, you've just stepped in the sand. I ordered a Jack on the rocks, and a seared ahi appetizer was ordered for the table. It was average. My GF ordered the pulled bbq pork sliders which looked awesome, her mom ordered the lobster tacos, which also looked awesome, and I ordered the Kobe beef burger. Yeah, I had to shake up complacency a bit, after all, I've been putting the hurt on the ceviche all week, I wasn't trying to have anymore seafood. I ordered the burger rare, and it was weird, the burger looked like tuna. It tasted good, but I couldn't get the feeling that it was still raw. I don't have a sensitive stomach, so I killed it anyway. It came with some fries, which were average. The buns were a little stale, but whatever. What was off the hook was the desserts! Man, they have bomb ass coffee macadamia chocolate mud pie that will fuck you up! It was amazing! We also ordered what we thought was the key lime pie, but it was actually a key lime cheesecake slice. It was killer! Those two desserts saved this review from being a 2. The service is also really spasmatic. They're cool when taking orders, but suck as far as checking on you throughout. The place wasn't even packed.

The atmosphere, the beachfront seating and decent food wraps up the experience into a nice one. For a reasonably priced experience on the beach, this is one of my favorite locations.

It's the type of restaurant that you would expect to be much pricier because of the ambiance but they managed to keep their prices low. I need to find more restaurants like these! The waitstaff were friendly.  It's kinda small but there was virtually no wait when we went on a Saturday afternoon. We got a seat outside right by the ""window"" which is just a glass barrier.Food: The food wasn't bad. I had the clam chowder (good) and split a fish and chips (4 fish sticks and fries, but still good nonetheless). My brother had a Kobe beef burger which he said was good. The calamari was good. They offer appetizers, seafood dishes, and even meat dishes.Value: Worth it! Mid-priced. We went for lunch on a weekend and everything was around $10 - $15 on the menu. IMO, the pricing is actually really good for a restaurant on the beach. I don't think you can find a lot of deals like that along the coastline.",5 star rating,Lakwanza W.

Unless you have two hours to wait for your cold food to arrive, take your business elsewhere. Our water glass were empty for 40 minutes before anyone stopped to check on us. I would give it two stars, however, the view partially makes up for our poor service. Oh, and don't ask to split a check. Our waitress did not make it past 4th grade arithmetic.

5/20/2009,"Aurora, CO","Hubby and I had dinner here with the inlaws our last night in the area.  I called the restaurant that morning on our way back from wine country to make a reservation and am REALLY glad I did as packed as it was when we got there for dinner.  But why wouldn't it be packed?  It was Friday.  It was a gorgeous evening.  They have a nice looking bar area.  And they're right on the beach.  And they have good food.We all really enjoyed our dinners.  I started with a martini while I perused the menu.  It was perfectly made.  Then I had the Chile and Lime Crab Cocktail and another martini.  Delicious!  Then I had the black cod (aka sablefish) with a curried Israeli couscous (and another martini).  It was so, so delicious.  I would have licked the bowl if I'd had a 4th martini!  The inlaws had the cioppino and the sole.  I forget what hubby had (although it was one of the specials for the evening), but everyone was very happy with their selections.  Afterward we all shared the Macadamia Nut Mudd Pie.  It was the right amount for the 4 of us.Our server was good and we didn't have to wait long for drinks.  There are plenty of heat lamps for the outdoor dining.  It was a tad warm for me with all of them on, but whatever.I highly recommend this place and will definitely put it on my list for the next time we visit.",4 star rating,Diane T.
5/15/2013,"Loveland, CO","We ate here the day before Mothers Day, i ordered the benedict which was pretty tasty. My girlfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy, which unfortunately arrived covered in clam chowder rather than gravy. Even more unfortunate was that my GF is extremely allergic to shellfish. After i tasted to confirm, we asked the waitress if they put clam chowder on the biscuit (and why they didnt mention it on the menu). She denied it and swore they use regular gravy. We asked her to check with the chef just to make sure, she came back a few mins later to say he definitely did not use clam chowder. By now my girlfriends lips and tongue were swelling and getting itchy, so we raced to the CVS. I dont know if it was laziness or negligence, but the lack of concern was scary. Dont eat here if you have any food allergies.",1 star rating,Tommy B.

I've been there twice, and the servers have been super warm and friendly. I gotta say, I haven't been impressed by the cocktails. The John Daly was pretty alright. The FOOD however, is amazing.

Service was not bad, not the best in the world but still good. Waitress was attentive and kind. Food on the other hand was just ok. Nothing special.

The outside area is great with fire pit like areas and tables that face the clear glass so you can see the water. We had a big lunch and most of us were still full so we ordered mostly appetizers and some entrees. My daughter had the salmon which was really good. My sister had the scallops and said they were perfect, but the stuff under it was strange. My husband and I shared the oysters rockefeller and the lobster and truffle mac and cheese. Both had good flavors. I got to sample the ahi poke, which was fresh. Also the fried calamari was good. The vanilla bean creme brulee was delicious. Nothing quite blew me away, but I will say that their service is on point!! They must watch you like a hawk because the second something was empty or done they appeared. Super friendly and attentive.

8/10/2013,"Sacramento, CA","We went to the Boathouse for lunch after strolling along the beach.  There was a long wait for a table so we decided to wait for our table and go to the crowded bar which is located in the center of the restaurant.  The female bartender was friendly and our drinks were good but expensive.  Unfortunately there was no place to sit at the bar to enjoy our drinks.We requested first available seating and after an hour wait we ended up inside the restaurant near a picture window overlooking the ocean.  As everyone else has mentioned, the view from the restaurant is impressive.  However, we found the food was not  as impressive as the view.  Two of us had a  kobe beef cheeseburger and another had the ahi club tuna sandwich.  The quality of the food was average and the prices were fairly high.  The wait service was adequate but not really attentive.  We had to ask for the server to refill our water glasses.  There are only  two small restrooms inside the restaurant.  There is one restroom for females and another restroom that is uni-sex.  There were waits for both restrooms and both of the restrooms were absolutely filthy!After our meal, we walked behind the restaurant.  The door to the kitchen was open and we heard loud Mexican music playing.  The kitchen looked chaotic and not too clean.  We noticed that there were some stairs that climbed up the cliff behind the restaurant.  We climbed up the stairs and at the top of the stairs there is a small patio that offers a panoramic view of the ocean and the beach below.",3 star rating,Sam S.

I typed in ""beach bar"" into my mobile Yelp App, and Boathouse came up at 1. And despite the mixed reviews, we figured, let's check it out! It was late on Saturday evening, and with the muggy overcast, so much for seeing an sort of sunset. Nevertheless, I can't see how anyone can give this place less than 3 stars, with the stunning beach view -- even if the food tasted awful! We ordered different fish dishes, mahi mahi, fresh sea bass, and my friend ordered a rack of lamb....everyone loved the food! The service was awesome (maybe cuz we were a buncha girls) :D I fell in love with the firestone brew! And we scarfed down a gianormous mud pie...no regrets there!

The apps or ""small bites"" are appropriately sized, as are the oversized beer glasses (22 oz).Specifically the 1) cioppino and 2) the linguine with clams were both a disappointment. I would avoid these (and any type of shellfish) at all costs and stick with appetizers and drinks.Boathouse, if you are listening: hire a new Buyer.

5/20/2011,"Alexandria, VA","I grew up on Hendry's Beach, and remember when the site of this restaurant was a snack shack serving coffee, sodas & fries.There have been a few ventures over the years, and even after I grew up and left home have always gone back to Hendry's, since it's walking distance from my family home on the Mesa.  I liked the Brown Pelican just fine, but when the latest iteration - the Boathouse - opened up, I knew I had to eat there at least once every time I visit home.Breakfast is the best meal to get, if you're about the environment as much as the food.  The Mesa's famous morning fog, just enough sunlight poking through, a nice breeze and a patio view of the beach - there is no better place in Santa Barbara to eat breakfast, and the prices are not far removed from that snack shack of the 80s when I was a kid there.Skip Ledbetter and the areas around Cabrillo Blvd - go out to Hendry's and check out the Boathouse.",5 star rating,Russell S.
8/24/2008,"Hacienda Heights, CA","The Boathouse (formerly the Brown Pelican) has just opened for business and is still working out the kinks. My friend (a former local) wanted to take me to the Brown Pelican for a lovely Sunday breakfast on the beach - we didn't know the restaurant had changed hands but decided to try it anyway.After putting in our name for a table, we proceeded to wait nearly an hour to be seated. We didn't have a problem with this as the restaurant appeared to be very popular like its predecessor. When we were seated at our table on the patio - it was apparent that we were in desperate need of an umbrella. They did not have enough umbrellas for the people seated at the patio - so we were forced to seek a small corner of shade from a neighboring table. Our server arrived and promptly introduced herself as ""Candy"" and proceeded to take our order. We ordered; a santa barbara omelet for my friend, and ""traditional"" eggs benedict for myself. We chat about the day and wait for our food. Forty-five minutes after placing our order with Candy, a nice young man named Mark came by to tell us the kitchen was running late and could he buy us a cocktail? We were surprised by this, but welcomed the drink. He continues to inform us that the restaurant has been ""comping"" all the breakfasts because of the kitchen's delay.Thirty minutes and a cigarette later, we are still patiently waiting for our food - while trying to keep a positive attitude.  Vanessa comes by our table to let us know that not only will she be replacing ""Candy"" but  the kitchen is an hour behind in getting out orders...We ask for some toast while we continue to ""stick it out"" as we've now been at the restaurant over two hours waiting for breakfast.  Shortly after the toast arrives, our food is dumped on our plate by a busboy with a certain frustrated flare. My girlfriends omelet is not what she ordered and the potatoes are cold; while my eggs are good - but I have the same issue with the potatoes. (sigh) VERY disappointing.Finished with our meal and desperate to make the most of the rest of our day, we wait to be released from our table like hostages. Vanessa reappears only to flutter about our neighboring table - filled with her friends- chatting about how she has aspirations of being a school teacher... and if they'll let dogs come and sit with the guests on the patio.Needless to say, it was not a great experience. We left annoyed and sunburned. The restaurant has potential - but what's a restaurant without food, service and ambiance?

The one thing I've noticed on the 3 or 4 time I've gone is the hostesses always overtime your wait time almost to try discouraging you to stay. On Mother's Day I went here, and def expected to wait a long time. Was quoted over an hour way and thought ok no problem. Looked around and noticed maybe one other party waiting but the place was packed but still counted maybe 5 empty tables. Figured it was for reservations so that's fine. Went and ordered drinks at the bar and literally got our drinks and then got buzzed to be sat. How can they justify telling me id wait well over an hour and seat me 10 minutes later. Owners please take note! This isn't good business when the first people they see tell them this. BUT- I continue to return because this place is wonderful.

5/15/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA",After living in SB my whole life this is my first time to the boathouse formerly known as the brown pelican. I have to say for BREAKFAST it was over hyped normal food at high prices. The food was ok. I got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. There was a healthy amount of salmon and it came out very quickly but fairly warm/room temp which made me think it wasn't all that fresh the hollandaise was a bit lacking but the egg was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were very flavorful but hardly warm when they reached my table. Its understandable for something like this to be made ahead but at least serve it hot. The staff was nice but they seemed so busy that they didn't have time to stop and check in on us until we flagged someone down for the check. They were understandably busy on a Sunday morning. I don't think I will be joining again for breakfast but dinner is a different story as their dinner options do look amazing. And I've heard great things,2 star rating,Brindi M.

6/14/2015,"Newport Beach, CA","We really only gave the Boat House two stars because it is on the beach. First the food. Very poorly presented and at best a 5 out of 10. Really, don't waste your money here. Skip the Caesar. It's bland at best. We ordered the local sole and the filet. The sole was fresh and tasted OK but was soaked in butter and dumped on top of a pile of random vegetables that had no flavor. The filet was bacon wrapped (who does that anymore?) The color was a weird grey with a strange pinky red sauce that was gross. Buried underneath were these  mashed potatoes that somehow curdled. We asked for a little garlic bread and it showed up black and burned on the bottom, which we didn't realize until we took a bite and wondered if the kitchen was on fire. Look there are a lot of really super places to eat in Santa Barbara. Lastly when we repositioned our table so that my wife and I could sit next to each other, rather than across the table, we were admonished by the manager even though it had no effect on the space or area for the server. Later two other couples saw what we did and flipped their tables to do the same thing. That ought to tell them something. Bottom line, don't get fooled into eating at the Boat House just because it's on the beach. Go to the beach and then eat somewhere else.",2 star rating,David P.

We waited for 20 minutes while three tables sat empty waiting to be bussed. We asked again how much longer, and were told two minutes. The tables were now bussed, but sat empty. Not once were we informed that they were getting a table a ready for us. After another ten minutes waiting and no acknowledgement from the hostess, while we stood at the hostess stand, we decided to leave.

And maybe take your dog for a stroll.  Right ... and catch a really great happy hour. Or brunch. The Boathouse is the easy answer. The outdoor terrace is reminicent of a surf side restaurants in the Cape or Hamptons. The distinctly Northeastern vibe, fresh seafood, and flirty cocktails make for the quintessential nautical experience, while maintaining the laidback California authenticity. Mountains on one side, beach on the other, and a bottle of wine and delicious meal in between. Who could ask for more?",5 star rating,Whitney K.

Dessert - I've heard their dessert is realllllllly good. I've tried the mud pie and it was huge and had a really good flavor but it was too frozen and hard. could have been defrosted a tad!

One star for the entree's.  I guess that works out to three stars.My suggestion is that you go to the Boat House for drinks and appetizers and then head someplace else after the sun goes down that knows how to prepare fish, chicken and steaks.  Way too much garlic on the free range chicken.  The fish I chose, macadamia encrusted mahi mahi, was overdone and tasteless.   Salad was fresh and the clam chowder was above average.",3 star rating,Chuck B.

All of the food we had was fantastic, we were a group of 5 and there was lots of sharing. Our server (I think her name was Taylor) was great! She was fun and the  timing of the meal gave us enough time to chat between courses but didn't seem slow at all. Only problem was my friend's lamb entree was overcooked. She immediately took it back to have it remade and a manager came to the table to check on us. Unfortunately, his meal didn't come back out until the rest of us were done eating so they took care of it and sent out dessert to apologize. Coming from a table of former servers, this was handled perfectly and definitely won't prevent us from coming back next time we are in town. The cocktails here are also great!",4 star rating,Jen M.

We enjoyed our dinner: clam chowder, fresh lobster, and seafood delight and had a great table beachside to take in the view. The server did not stop by much and would not even look our way to get his attention. We finally had to ask another server to bring us the wine list and our wine. I can't help but compare it to our last anniversary dinner in Coronado Island at Candelas where the service was outstanding and they made us feel so special. Anyway, the food is better than I expected from all the previous reviews. Try to reserve it for sunset as I could only imagine the view would be spectacular!

The portions of seafood was more than adequate.  They even did split plates for us without us asking.  The manager was very courteous.Cons: The parking is sort of limited.  It isn't to close to State street or the pier (for those who don't have a car).  The servers are a little forgetful but are nice.",4 star rating,Frederick D.

As a Santa Barbara local I can't get enough of this restaurant and I'm always proud to take my out of town guests here for any meal of the day. Breakfast, lunch, sunset cocktails or dinner I'm always pleased and surprised by the large selection of items and great specials. I always suggest the Boathouse signature breakfast, the ahi poke and the spiced rubbed sea bass with lemon saffron butter sauce- mouthwatering, memorable and oh so satisfying. If you are craving an adult beverage don't miss the blood orange margarita. The staff is always upbeat and happy to serve you. The kitchen staff really takes pride in their presentation and food is hot, fresh and made to order. I highly recommend you try the Boathouse if you're looking for a great meal and killer views.

6/15/2009,"Sacramento, CA","I researched this restaurant for a graduation dinner in June 2009.  Found the restaurant on Yelp among many others.  We pick this place because it can accommodate a large group (patio only), decent menu choices and they accepted reservations whereas other restaurants in this area with a decent rating did not. Regardless, we booked in April and our reservation time was 8:30 p.m.  (restaurant close at 9 p.m.). I had communicated with the event coordinator to call me ahead if there was a cancellation.  She came through and called me an hour before our reserved time and said our table would be ready at 8 p.m.; needless to say, our table was not ready and we waited an additional 15 minutes after our original 8:30 time. It's all good, the important thing was she did call me.Location location location: The restaurant is located right off a public beach.  The restaurant is not facing west, so no sunset while you're enjoying your cocktail.  But nice views of the beach and ocean.  There's nothing here but the restaurant and public beach.  Service and Food: When we finally sat down, we were all tired and I'm sure the staff were too, but there were really attentive and accommodating. The hostess were helpful....moving the umbrella...getting extra chairs.  The food was pretty good (thank you yelpers!).  Fresh, a little salty for some, nice portions, entrees include soup or salad.  What a deal, most seafood restaurant charge you extra for soup or salad.  I had the cioppino and it's was yummy with large prawns, crab claw, fish, mussels, clams and scallops.  Everyone enjoyed their food, thank goodness especially after the long wait.  We didn't have dessert, it was just too late.Their honeycomb mojito and the acai martini was good.  Bar access from patio or restaurant.  Bathroom was clean (it's the one room kind).  Patio had heat lamps and surrounded by glass. I gave it a four star with the combination of ambiance, location service and food; if not for the location, 3.5 stars!Would I come back if I'm in the area....maybe...I'll try their small plates next time!",4 star rating,Glo F.

They do not know or care to know how to cook tofu. Completely flavorless and burnt from the grill, it was hard to keep it down. Vegetables were also not seasoned well. Second time I went for brunch, and ordered the french toast. There was no orange zest or cinnamon as mentioned in the description, and that is what I was looking forward to. My friend ordered an omelette that supposedly had salsa included, and there was none. So when we asked for some we were brought hot sauce. Service is nice though and the view is great which is why I give two stars instead of one. Although, I could make tastier food at home.

5/26/2009,"Detroit, MI","I had the Vanilla Bean Texas French Toast and the my friend had the Spinach and cheese omelet. It was fantabulous. We split everything half way. the toast was perfect. They were light and fluffy wit the perfect amount of powdered sugar on them. I normally am not into powdered sugar on my french toast, but I didn't mind it. There 6 very large halves and the syrup was Grade A Maple Syrup. None of that cheap s*&^. The omelet was great. Very delicious. The spinach, mushrooms and cheese were all fresh and you could taste it int he flavor. the spinach was green and lush; the mushrooms didn't have that funky consistency that mushrooms have (usually when they are a bit older), they were baby mushrooms and packed with flavor, and the cheese, Provolone I believe (I was pretty drunk- so remembering this much info is amazing for me right now) was awesome. I can tell you it was white cheese- that I know for sure :)The potatoes were awesome and so was the English muffin. the best part about this place is we sat inside next to a window and all of a sudden there were about 30 dolphins just doing their thing. It was so amazing and mesmerizing. I just love the fact that i can see the kill for the day. I'm just kidding- I don't eat dolphin. I couldn't help myself.All in all- the service was good but not great- and here's why. About 5 minutes after we ordered we found the special sheet buried under the condiments and we were so urked because we would have loved to have tried everything on the menu. The waitress never told us our specials, but she also came straight to work from a long night out of partying on heavy drugs. But she was very sweet.

7/23/2012,"Villa Park, CA","What a horrible experience! My girlfriend and I arrived with my mother for what should have been a wonderful experience. The restaurant looked great andthe view was spectacular. Too bad we left before we even got to order. The place was a little busy, but we expected to wait 15 minutes. Once we were seated, a waitress gave us water and that was the last we were acknowledged. After waiting around 15 minutes we thought we would flag someone down to get our waitress so we could order. We said to a bus buy, ""Excuse me, but can you get our waitress?""  in which he replied in a very condescending tone, ""Pardon?, OK"". He gave us a scowling look like we shouldn't have been talking to him and he quickly left. After waiting an additional 15 minutes, and the waitress visiting multiple tables around us, we were about through. She never once even looked in our direction. At this point, I would usually just go up to the waitress and let her know that she forgot about us. When I was about to do this, I see her walk over to a guy who JUST sat down, sit down next to him, give him a kiss on the cheek, and begin talking to him with her arm around him. That crossed the line, and I suggested we leave in which my party was in total agreement. We left the restaurant, told the hostess what happened, and ate somewhere else. If the management reads this, you should know that your amazing view does not make up for horrible service. You should also invest in more then 1 waitress for your indoor seating area.I really wish this experience was better, as my Mom lives minutes away and I was hoping we could have made their brunch a ritual during my visits. Good thing Santa Barbara has no lack of good restaurants in town, as we will find a new place to go on my visits. Not to mention that wasting 1 hour of our day completely ruined our schedule. TL;DR - After being seated and waiting ~30 minutes without acknowledgement, we saw the waitress sit down, kiss her friend/S.O. and completely ignore us. We promptly left and found somewhere better to eat.",1 star rating,Bryant T.
3/25/2016,"Yorba Linda, CA","We dined on a Thursday evening. The wows-location is stunning. Our reservation was at 6:00 and we were promptly seated. However, we sat for about seven minutes or so before anyone approached us. Our server took our drink and appetizer order. When we were not offered bread or water, I asked a nearby busboy and he brought us some. Our drinks waited on the bar for several minutes before we received them. The mussels were excellent, served in a rich broth with delicious grilled bread. My husband enjoyed his sea bass. I ordered the cioppino, which was tasty (except for the white fish which was overcooked). However, it was a repeat of my appetizer, with addition of other seafood (I do believe the menu stated the appetizer was served in the choppino broth). An attentive server would have pointed out that similarity. We finished our meal with an Irish coffee and the mud pie. This dessert described the ice cream as coffee; it was bland vanilla at best and served in a mason jar rather than the typical towering slice. Our experience was okay.",2 star rating,Pattie C.

2/8/2010,"San Francisco, CA","Came here for a Sunday brunch, while on visit in Santa Barbara.  I'm from SoCal, but have been living in NorCal so long that I sometimes go for really long stretches forgetting how much I love sunshine and real beaches.  The Boat House is right on a beach that's framed by rocky cliffs, that's filled with puppies and their owners (it's dog-friendly!), and that seriously sparkles with daytime surf.   This helped snap me out of a long NorCal spell, reminded me of just why I'll probably never truly, truly be able to call myself a Bay Area girl; and, along with the fact that it offers al fresco dining and wall-to-wall windows inside so you can fully appreciate all this while you eat, earned Boat House its first three stars from me, easy.  It's like they say:  location, location, location.But that's not all Boat House has got going for it.  It gets another star and a half (yeah, I really want to give it a 4.5) for its friendly staff, quick service, and yummy breakfast food and cocktails.  I got the Signature Breakfast with a mimosa; my friend got the Chilaquiles, corned beef hash, and a blood orange margarita.  They weren't knock-your-socks off amazing, but boy were they yummy.  The total damage for all that was about $60-- a pretty decent price for this kind of Sunday bliss.After all that, the hypnotic ladies' room tiles (seriously, if you go, make sure to check these out!) and our Dennis Franz sighting (he was having breakfast with his family) were just icing on the cake.",4 star rating,E R.
8/9/2012,"Los Angeles County, CA","Yes, all the comments in other reviews about the location of this place is true.  It has a fabulous view because it is located right on the beach.  However, their ""private parking lot"" is always crowded.  Consider yourself really lucky if you can find a spot any time of the day because it is a shared parking lot for Hendry's Beach as well.The food?  So-so but expensive.  For a lunch date with my husband on a Friday, I had their portebello mushroom sandwich.  It isn't anything to write home about.  There wasn't any special flavor or anything that made it especially good here.  Since there was no source of protein in this sandwich, I asked for some salmon.  The waiter pointed out that the addition will cost an additional $10.  What?!  My sandwich is $12 (and for the portebello mushroom sandwich, it seemed a bit steep as is), and they wanted to add $10 more for some protein (which is farmed salmon - don't get me started about farmed fish.  It's not even wild salmon!)?  What a rip off!  Apparently, adding chicken costs $5.  I managed to compromise and asked for smoked salmon (which is usually wild and comes from a cleaner environment), and the waiter agreed to charge me $5 additional instead of the $10 for regular (farmed!) salmon.  Sheesh, the nerve to charge the price of my lunch for just a small piece of protein!My portebello sandwich turned out to be thin with a couple pieces of smoked salmon and very little else between the 2 pieces of bread.  Oh well, what do you expect for a $17 sandwich?My husband ordered a tuna melt.  There was so little tuna in it that it should have been a veggie sandwich.  There was just a slice of lettuce in it to justify calling it a veggie sandwich.  I can't remember what his cost but it was less than $10.  What a deal...not.We live in Santa Barbara but we haven't been here since the Boathouse took over.  It used to be called the Brown Pelican, which seemed more reasonable.  We know the prices here, but this seemed steep even for this area of town.  I say take your business elsewhere with an ocean view.  There are others in town more worthy of your money.",1 star rating,Linda S.

It doesn't get any better than this view, especially at sunset.Ok, now on the food.  It was worthy of the 3 Stars I gave it.  The apps were decent (we had a ton ranging from pulled pork sliders to calamari), and the entrees (I had swordfish and I also tasted the Mahi) were good. The only thing worthy of more than 3 stars is the drinks. Fan-freakin-tastical.  Ever have a blood orange margarita? I hadn't. It's ridiculously good.  I also had a mango mojito that kicked me in the face.If I went back, I'd be going for the view or else I'd just sit at the bar and drink the fantastic cocktails.

They have a little shaded area for them, but I felt bad for our pup. We took him to the dog beach just for him and the poor guy had to sit alone and watch us eat our breakfast before he got to play. Next time we'll eat at home and hit up the Boathouse for lunch after our dog is totally worn out. So they don't get 5 stars since the pup wasn't welcome in front of a beach meant for him.

2/2/2015,"Anaheim, CA","I was in Santa Barbara for the weekend visiting a friend w my BF. My BF went to UCSB and remembered this place fondly so we tried it for breakfast. The location is great. Right on the beach with great views. It was crowded on Sunday morning which was no surprise. weather was great and everyone wanted to sit outside. We only waited 15 mins and got a seat inside but right by a huge window and could see the beach. My bf ordered an omelet...sorry I cant remember which one. He said it was good and came with side of toast. I was on the fence what to order. I asked the waiter what he thought of the Lobster Omelets and he wasn't that excited about it. I asked him what he recommended and he said the Chilaquiles with green sauce. Comes with pork meat and side of black beans. Oh i was excited sounded delicious. Received our food and was so disappointed with mine...sad face. The black beans were cold as if right out of the fridge and lacked salt. The chilaquiles had green sauce that Im sure was out of a can and i had 3 small bits of pork...not even kidding...3 small pieces. Glob of sour cream on top which i removed and my over medium egg. Ate what I could and we left. Service was great, everyone was polite and attentive. Not more than 20 mins after leaving I had stomach cramps...oh no my breakfast wanted out immediately ! sorry to be so graphic but you know how it is. Luckily I was at my friends house and took care of business. 30 min later we are on the road heading back to Orange County when Round II of stomach cramps. UGH! I will not eat here again.

8/23/2015,"Boston, MA","So I was spending one night with my wife in Santa Barbara, which happened to be a Friday night, so we had one chance to get a great breakfast on Saturday. I looked over all the possibilities on Yelp, and then decided on Hendry's Beach Boathouse because I liked that it was more remote and had great beach views, and the food looked good, not to mention the bloody marys. Suffice it to say that we were not disappointed. They nailed the food (chilaquiles and rancheros) and the bloody mary's were great. Since there was a wait I was grateful for the shrimp and bacon in my bloody mary, and the atmosphere there was so chill that we didn't mind hanging out by the bar for 45 minutes. The service was really good and overall it was an exceptional experience. Very glad I made that decision.",5 star rating,Thomas B.
6/1/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","I am not going to lie, we go here for the view and the atmosphere.  The food and drinks are an added bonus!  They have wonderful cocktails- usually we each have to order a couple because we can't decide which we want.  If you like a kick, the jalapeno basil martini is amazing.  The portions are small to average sized for the price, and of course, the prices are very high for what you get.  But, the flavors are excellent and if you are going mainly for the view, sometimes you just have to pay the price.  Mahi mahi salad was really good but we could have eaten twice as much fish as was served.  Smoked salmon platter is really good but the serving size is less than other places around town.  The chowder is so so but still yummy.  Burgers are good.  Shrimp quesadilla is great.  Calamari is really good too.  Faves are the seared ahi and crab cakes.  One time we ordered seconds of each because they were so good but not enough.  (That was an expensive bill!)  Suggestions; Make a reservation for the patio.  Come during off hours (early breakfast or mid afternoon or weekday).  If you have to wait to be seated outside, come with a book or take a walk (if its high tide, walk north because you can walk farther north at high tide) because the patio is worth the wait.  If you don't want to spend a lot, come for a drink (but 1 may not be enough because they are delicious) and share a small bite or shrimp cocktail or calamari.",4 star rating,M Q.

We started with the Grilled Prawns-delish-and a yummy Wedge Salad-mundane, but reliable. We had a couple of fish dishes, Mahi-Mahi and the Salmon Special, and they were cooked to perfection. They let us enjoy the meal at our pace and never rushed us in spite of the fact that they had a lot of people waiting.Our server, Gina, was attentive, but not overbearing.

I  I brought this to the hostesses attention to which she said, ""they requested a window seat"". So 20 minutes later, we were offered yet another table, one immediately adjacent to the horrible table they originally tried to seat us at.

The salmon was overcooked and served with a Caesar salad instead of the vegetables. That would have been OK but the romaine lettuce was old, warm, wilted and black and around the edges and tasteless. The waiter brought veggies that were obviously microwaved with no seasonings or taste. My daughter's sliders were not hot or were her fries. It is a gorgeous place to eat; it was a gorgeous day but common guys for 50.00+ dollars for a simple meal it should be better than this.  I keep trying to support this local restaurants but I am not sure if I'll be back.

1/21/2014,"Mission Viejo, CA","Came from out of town for our 25th wedding anniversary.  After the wonderful reviews received here on Yelp we made a reservation for 7:00 on Saturday 1/18 (made the reservation 2 weeks in advance: and told them it was our anniversary and would like to be ""on the glass"" outside).  Arriving at 7:00 on the dot the hostess pointed to our beautiful table ""on the glass"" and said it would be just a moment to clear it.  We then watched a gentleman (who we later found out was manager Mark) come over and tell the hostess that he would be taking that table for a group of 3 people who were clearly his friends/regulars.  He then sat them at the table.  We waited and watched for 15 min. the poor hostess try and figure out were she was going to put us.  She then offered us a seat in the back by the trash cans/entrance to kitchen.  We said what happen to our beautiful table and she said there was a mix up and as soon as someone gets up we will have the next table.  Well that took 40 mins.  My husband then asked to talk to manager (thats how we found out it was Mark).  He didn't seem concerned and said he knew it was our anniversary and that we had made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and he would ""take care of us"".  We were finally seated at 8:00 pm to a very dark table (couldn't read the menu).  Hoping for the rest of the meal to be good? Nope....The Bad:  The Blood Orange Margarita was weak and $9.00: The wine came and both glasses had lipstick on them.  Our waitress didn't know what the market price was on any of the items and had to leave the table to find out: not returning for 10 min. The so called 1.5 lb lobster was closer to 1 lb and very skinny.  My steak was cooked well done and tough.  The Creme Brulee was cold and thin like it had been made the day before.The Good: The Oysters my husband got were the best thing on the menu.Mark never came to check on us but our waitress said "" Mark would like to make this up to you by taking care of your 2 drinks"" wow what a guy $16.00 comp for a screwed up 25th Wedding Anniversary Dinner...

7/22/2012,"Manhattan Beach, CA","A disappointing dining experience. We had heard about the fantastic view from a friend and ventured to try it out. When we arrived the hostess was pleasant and promptly sat us. We had called approximately 30 minutes prior asking to be put on the wait list with a request for a table with a view. The table and initial greeting were perfect. It took them at least 12 minutes to come over and ask for a drink order, I know this because after it had been a while I glanced at my watch, so realistically more like 15-20 minutes, but a confirmed 12. I ordered an iced tea. There are moments when I become slightly concerned that I am 'that girl' and when I tasted the iced tea I had one. It was not delicious at all and I returned it, opting for club soda. Who knew iced could be so wrong.Our salads arrived and the lettuce was warm. Again not delicious and at this point just disappointing. The dressing was decent.Our entrees came next, I ordered the ono and my friend ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi.  The mahi and accompanying rice was pretty good. My ono was overcooked, tough and a very small portion (I suppose the portion size didn't matter because I didn't want to finish it). The polenta that I requested with it was awful and even the vegetables were off. At this point I just stopped eating, asked for the check and left.A side note on service in general: Our server was totally ok, not great not awful, but he got the job done. The rest of the staff seemed at the same level. No one smiled or seemed warm or genuine. The expo slammed down both our plates and the plates of the couple next to us. This is a restaurant poorly ran and relying on their view to distract from the food and service. It's a nice view but...",2 star rating,Sam M.

9/29/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","We go for breakfast and sometimes the service is a little slow, but I think on that day, they were understaffed. It was a beautiful day and everyone wanted to sit outside. It looked like they only had one wait staff member and a couple of drink boys. It was midweek so maybe everyone else is in school, which is a great place to be. We get the eggs benedict. We like it because the eggs are cooked perfectly and the sauce does not overpower the dish. For a special occasion, we come for dinner. The sunset is gorgeous and the ocean view is exceptional. You may wait awhile, but they have a bar and waiting to take in the view is not half bad. For dinner, we have had the sea bass and the halibut. The fish is always cooked very well! We have had the steak and the proportions are pretty good in comparison to some other places.

3/28/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","I'm a local and the Boathouse has a pleasant and seductive location right on the water. I usually go there for happy hour or for dinner with guests out of town. Arrived there tonight with $100 groupon and boyfriend. The idea of a Cadillac margarita was ringing in my head. Bomb. Sent back.....terrible. This is my drink of choice and if it's bad with grand marnier....seriously, it's bad. They remade it and it was a 5/10. I had macadamia nut mahi mahi and partner had steak and prawns. His was good, made as ordered (but to be honest he ordered a Mai tai which he returned and exchanged for a beer). Mine was eh, not that great. I've had this dish many times, it's a favorite of mine. This chef makes it broiled with macadamia nuts scattered over the top. For 26 bucks I expected better. But this is the problem with some restaurants that think if they are located with a lovely view ""they will come.""  While yes people do come it should be noted that if you are really looking for the meal quality, this might not be the place for you. I've always hoped that this 3-restaurant chain would get their act together or we get a dynamo competitor like Lure to make them step up their game. Am I disappointed?  Eh, not really.

4/19/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","This place offers awesome views and a casual yet posh atmosphere. However in terms of service it's lacking in several different ways. When we first arrived I asked how long the wait would be, a fairly straight forward question I thought, the hostess could only answer, ""I don't know you're our first large group on the list."" Okay, not a big deal we'll wait at the bar to be called. At the bar we waited for several minutes while the staff had a conversation, during the middle of which one of them pushed a menu towards us with not so much of a glance or a greeting. The bartender finally greeted us and asked for out order. We we're seated about 20 minutes later. Not bad, I though. I had the lobster tacos, they were okay, a little dry. My friend ended up with a splinter from the knife she was using. When she approached the server he seemed annoyed, and asked, ""what do you want me to do about it?"" Seriously? This place sucks.",2 star rating,aimee p.

10/27/2011,"Morro Bay, CA","Disappointed as I had been to the Brown Pelican which was at this location previously which was excellent. The Boathouse was highly recommended. Monday night was not too busy. Like Anthony Bodain suggests. ""Never eat out on a Monday."" We waited quite a while before we ever saw our waiter. Drinks were ordered along with an Ahi appetizer. Generic so far. The Caesar salad was brought before we were finished with the appetizer.The Caesar salad sucked...This salad was hot not warm HOT. Wilted as if the waiter made it,  and let it set in the hot line window. I did not complain because I was not paying. Tasteless. Again the plates were never cleared and the entrées brought before we were finished with the salad. The menu stated rack of lamb. A lamb rack is 8 bones. There was no mention of a half rack. I was served a half rack. The menu never stated ""Half Rack"" rip off. False advertising???? Way too many other great restaurants in Santa Barbara to waist your time at this place.

I came here on Saturday night with several friends and it was lucky that we called ahead to get on the waiting list because the place was PACKED! Even having been on the waiting list for half an hour we still had to wait another 15 minutes to be seated, but the fire pit was a nice place to wait at so no complaints. We ordered the calamari to share, I got the Rack of Lamb which was worth the $32 that I paid for it, it was juicy and fall off the bone tender, heaven in my mouth. My friends got the Halibut and the seafood pasta which were both wonderfully delicious! For desert we got a Banana Foster to share since we forgot that dinner entrees come with either soup or salad so we were too stuffed for desert. But the Banana Foster was amazing! The liqueur sauce that it was in just made it so much better! I really love this place even though it is small and usually pretty crowded, and a bit too pricey!",5 star rating,Maggie A.

Had to ask 3 times for drink refills. Finally got it when we asked for the check. Oh yeah, we were overcharged $60. Someone else's order was added to our bill. The staff here needs some serious help.

8/19/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","The Boathouse has been a favorite of ours for about a year now.  The food and service have always been stellar, and the location is simply the best in Santa Barbara.  It's a local hangout, but as a hotelier it's also the place I send most of our out of town guests who want a ""Santa Barbara"" experience.  I highly recommend the seafood skewers (roasted on an actual grill, then laid on a bed of tasty rice), the lobster tacos, and the Ahi Sandwich.  They are located right at Arroyo Burro Beach (known locally as Hendry's), and it's really fun to have a few margaritas at made by their top notch bartenders, a few appetizers, and then stroll out to the tide pools at low tide.  If you're lucky, you can spot schools of dolphins sporting in the waves not 50 feet from the shore. A great experience for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  Take it from a local Santa Barbarian who's lived in town for 25 years...The Boathouse ROCKS!!!",5 star rating,Eric F.

1/28/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love this place! Been coming here for almost 5 years at least once a week. I never had a complaint about it, but recently service hasn't been that great. Hostesses are snobby. Sometimes there's 4 standing around  the podium chatting it up, and they get upset if you interrupt their conversation. Last time I waited one hour an a half for a table outside, and when they finally sat me down I realized there was another empty table by the window so I asked for it. They denied me the table and gave it to the party behind me. I didn't complain but then it took at least 10min for a waiter to get our drinks order. He took our food order after we got our drinks and we never saw him again until he brought us the check.

We did however get seated at a nice table with an amazing ocean view. Service was excellent and the attention to re-filling water glasses was amazing. I ordered the boathouse punch to drink and personally didn't care for it. I had a sip of the blackberry mai tai and that was delicious! Our waiter told us the special, which was a grilled salmon with green beans and wild rice. I went with that as did 3 other people at my table. The order also came with a soup or salad and I had a bowl of clam chowder, which is my favorite soup. The chowder was really good. Dinner came out a little bit later and I personally thought there was a lot of butter used in the rice and green beans, which made it rich. The salmon was grilled nicely. We didn't order dessert because we were all very full.  I would recommend coming here but keep in mind you are paying for the view.",4 star rating,Lauren J.

However, after having been here we were quite disappointed. The view is spectacular as is the restaurant layout, it seems be quite the hangout spot for locals and tourists. But, the food left much to be desired. I had the salmon, which appeared to be bought at Ralph's not flown in from out of the country as advertised. The portion was poor and the skin was still left on as was some fish debris. The vegetables served with the salmon were plain and could have come from a Green Giant package. The grilled prawn appetizer was the only highlight of the meal, minus the work needed to peel the prawns before eating it.Overall, the place is great for watching sunsets and whales, not enjoying a meal.",2 star rating,Anonymous L.

Today, as usual I went there to have brunch with my friends. We were four people. I ordered a lobster omelet which was really good. My friends ordered Chicken Caesar Salad, The Santa Barbara Omelet and a dozen of oyster. We had a really great time. HOWEVER, in the end our server gave us a check which include 18% gratuity. Our server's name was MIKE. I work in a restaurant, too. I know sever can included the gratuity in the bill for the table which has five people or more. I dont know about the policy in Boathouse but I am not happy about what the server did today because it looks like we dont want to pay the tips or he thinks that we dont have enough money to pay for his tips. If we have five people or more I would not complain anything about it.     I must said... one time, I went to have brunch with three other friends and the server didnt put gratuity in the bill.

Begins with the hostess and continues with the severely understaffed waiting crew.  Arrived, views are excellent outside, but their was a wait.   Hostess had no idea how long the wait was, and quoted me ""four couples"". Not sure how long that would take, but we opted for an inside seat.  This place was packed at 545 on a thursday.  Took us about 10 minutes to see a waiter about 45 minutes after that until food arrived.  The steak was far from prime, fish was cooked to death, the garlic mash was tasty but had acorn size potato pieces and the veggies were mush.  Average entree was 25 to 30 range.  The side salad had the wrong dressing.  Maybe an appetizer and beer place while on the beach, skip dinner and prepare to wait.",2 star rating,Patriot G.

My husband who is a healthy guy got oatmeal with berries. there was about a 1/3 cup of oatmeal and they charged $6 for the 1/2 cup of berries!

12/2/2013,"Granada Hills, CA","I was disappointed at the experience . First off it was my wife's birthday and we decided to drive up from LA  to celebrate. We made reservations for a party of 5. When we got there they sat us Ina table for 4!! As we were waiting for our drinks I asked the blonde waitress if this is how they sit a party of 5 in a table for 4. She asked if we made reservations and I said yes. She said that we were given that table because they won't sit 5 in a table for 6! Then I asked it we can move to a booth ( it seemed bigger than a table for 4) she said yes and that she would put a fifth chair on the end . So we moved. We we sat down waiting for the chair for end, she said because we were seated by an exit we couldn't get a chair for the fifth person in our party. Frankly we were hungry and just wanted to get on with the dinner. The steak I ordered was med rare and what arrived was a rare steak. Seared on the outside and blood red on the inside. The seafood dish was bland. My wife ordered a surf n turf and the steak was so flat she actually asked for steak sauce.she has never done this in her life.The dessert was ok.

However our breakfast yesterday was amazingly poor in both service and food, especially considering that they were not very busy. I have not had such poor service in a restaurant of any kind in many years. The server was almost indifferent to what we wanted. We had to remind him that we wanted to specify how our eggs were cooked. Of four people, three breakfasts were served wrong. For three over easy eggs two got sunnyside and one got poached. And the sunnysides were cooked hard on the one side. The poached eggs were cooked hard. One of the four didn't get the ordered toast. A couple at the next table had both of their orders served wrong. Then there was the food. The bacon was tough like jerky indicating that it had been microwaved instead of properly fried. The omelet had the appearance and texture of a slab of rubber wrapped around greasy contents. The guacamole on the omelet had a slightly off taste indicating that a bad avocado had been included in the mix. The view is fine and the only reason to come here.",1 star rating,Jim C.

Tried the Cioppino the first time I came here on a cold beach day, and it was nice. Then I came back a second time and the food was not as impressive. They don't have that much to offer on their menu either. Finally tried to give it a third shot and it was just terrible. The service was awful from the moment I left my name. There seems to be a bunch of people working here more interested in socializing, and trying too hard to be cool than working.. Think frat party! Our waitress took our order and never returned again. Every time we tried to get her attention she practically ran away, & wouldn't make eye contact. No drink refills, nothing. Finally, after waiting almost an hour to get our food I asked to speak to a manger and told them to just cancel our order. Then miraculously the food came out just as we were getting up to leave. Told them to forget it out of principle.. That food was probably sitting under a heat lamp and forgotten. It was just a bad experience. The menu, the mediocre food on previous visits, the service..

Service has ranged from o.k. to bad, and food has ranged from completely average to slightly above average. To put it in perspective, the last time I went, our group had a reservation for 6pm on the patio with the view. By the time 6:30 rolled around they said they could put us inside, which to us was pointless because the best part of the restaurant is the view.When we were finally seated service was slow but competent.  I had the mixed seafood penne pasta, which I thought was overly oily but otherwise tasted fine. Food there is pretty overpriced.If you know exactly what you're getting into, which is average food/service but an amazing view at sunset, then I'd recommend the boathouse. If not, other seafood places in SB offer much better food.",3 star rating,Y L.

12/8/2013,"Fullerton, CA","Great ambiance! Seating is available on the patio with heaters thank goodness, however we opted to sit inside! The restaurant sits on the water.  This is the third restaurant in the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company family whose commitment is to serve fresh local product source the finest seafood. The seafood choices were amazing! We started with the Abalone Appetizer.  I have never had Abalone and now could eat this everyday.  It was sautéed in butter and served over sautéed spinach, roasted corn tortilla strips and a roasted Padilla chili cream sauce- to die for! My entree was the Mesquite grilled local White Sea Bass. This was so tender and served over garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed seasonal vegetables and topped with roasted tomato buerre Blanc.  We enjoyed our dinner with a bottle of Far Niente Chardonnay- paired perfectly.  We ended the evening with a Bananas Foster- it was fabulous! Will definitely be back!",5 star rating,Kealoha A.

1/26/2014,"Brooklyn, MI",The Boathouse is a little difficult to find for a first time visitor.  It shares a public parking lot with the beach crowd which makes early dinner parking challenging.  The view is magnificent and the food is top notch.  The service was very professional if not engaging.  I had the fresh catch and a colleague had a steak and both were top notch.  Prices were very reasonable given the stunning location and view.  Looking forward to my next visit.,4 star rating,Tony P.

Great atmosphere (right on the beach) and free parking! Good menu variety...ordered a classic breakfast - 2 eggs, substituted smoked salmon for bacon/sausage (felt like salmon that day!), potatoes and biscuit. Everything else was pretty good, but potatoes were a bit dry for my taste. It was ok, can't say it was great food. And our waitress was not very attentive, but I'm usually not too fazed by waiters/waitresses (unless completely rude). But the atmosphere made up for it. Not sure if I would come back here...maybe!

The atmosphere was casual and service was great. I haven't gotten a chance to to visit the boat house during the day yet but i was able to go a few times for dinner and drinks. Lets just say they really classed the place up. Its a bit more high end than what it used to be, especially for dinner. The atmosphere is 'quiet dining on the ocean. They have a beautiful fire/sand area and the outside is heating well with gas heaters. Their food is decent (but could be better). But the service is great and the atmosphere really kicks A. The interior seems a little bright so maybe they need to work on the lighting a bit. And it s a great spot to come grab a drink and socialize as well.

5/16/2010,"Visalia, CA",If you are going to the Boathouse it would be for the view and not the food. The food was Denny's level at best but the view is worth a million dollars. You can't even concentrate on your conversation because the view is just that amazing. I had a classic bacon and eggs with a biscuit for brunch. The bacon tasted old and not at all fresh. It just had this overcooked and not fresh taste. The biscuits look like they are going to be phenomenal and then then you bite in and it's dry and flavorless. This could be an awesome restaurant if they just focused more on the quality and flavor of the food. If I took people there again I would say it's gorgeous but just don't set your hopes to high for the food.,3 star rating,Christina S.

12/19/2013,"San Luis Obispo, CA","First of all, there was a horrible sewer smell when we walked up to the restaurant.  We started sitting outside, but once and awhile that sewer smell wafted in. So we decided to move in doors. It was loud- inside and outside with the bar crowd. I think the bar must be great.   Our waiter was really nice. His description of the special sounded great I ordered that.  Fresh  grilled halibut with pear glaze over  asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.  The fish was was warm, but everything else on the plate was cold. The potatoes tasted like they came from  freeze dried boxed potatoes. There was no indication that the fish had been grilled. It was cooked, but I am not sure how. The pear sauce tasted like something you should eat with turkey - not fish. It's consistency was that of apple sauce. And it was smeared over the fish. The fish was ""different"". I eat a lot of fish and this just didn't seem right. Can't really put it into words.  Overall, the people were nice, the place was noisy and the food was bad. I felt like I wasted my money.  I see I am the only one who has a bad review so it may have been just an off night for them. But this was my experience. Sorry. I hate to give a bad review.",2 star rating,Linda S.

Friends told us that we had to make a point of eating here, so last Wednesday we went there for breakfast. After being seated it took our waiter (Stephen) 10 minutes just to approach our table and then he acted like he was doing us a favor by doing so. We ordered an omelette and oatmeal which took 30 minutes to come out. In that time Stephen came by 0 times. It was like we didn't exist. It was late morning and there couldn't have been more than 10 people dining. The Chorizo omelette was really bland. Stephen never came to ask how our meal was and no one picked up our empty dishes. We had to go find Stephen so we could get our bill. Maybe Stephen was having a bad day and we paid the price for it.

My review has taken on an entire new animal as I've read some of the ""crazy"" previous reviews. So, lets speak to my event first....My husband and I went in on Friday, without reservation. After a good wait, because it was so busy,  we were seated and served a truly delicious meal! From the service to the actual food, I am more than pleased!! I had the Seabass, my husband the steak. Both were truly phenomenal! Now, to the next issue.... Because of the wait we opted to take a quick beach check and then head to the bar. This is where a few of the reviews have completely lost me. So,  I've got to weigh in here....what in the world are these dog people talking about? Not only do they have a very elaborate ""dog sanctuary""  built for dogs literally right outside of the restaurant, I also saw someone who worked there come and replace a water dish! I remember thinking, as a dog lover  how awesome that was, being that you cannot take your dog into a restaurant!! I'm not quite sure what or where these people are coming from or really what they are reviewing. The food, the ambience, the view  and the staff are amazing. Oh, and its a super fantastic place to take your dog! Go, you will be happy!!",5 star rating,amy e.
4/7/2012,"Sebastopol, CA","I wish I could give no stars.  I am outraged by the behavior of the management at this restaurant.  We ordered oysters to start. When they arrived, one was incredibly small compared to the others. Obviously not worth the $2.75 we paid, and, in my opinion, unacceptable to serve. Another oyster actually had CRAB inside it moving around. The waitress had a horrible attitude and was incredibly unapologetic when we asked for replacements.  After we finished our meal and paid the bill, I asked to speak to the manager, just to let him know about the terrible customer service. I was shocked when the MANAGER was then rude, demanding to know  exactly what she said, and telling me it wasnt a big deal. I hope the restaurant owner reads this so they can be aware that their restaurant MANAGER, who should be representIng the epitome of customer service, was acting egregiously.

We loved the big windows overlooking the beach and the ocean. Two of us had the halibut and it was small but cooked perfectly and the lobster buerre blanc was heavenly. The linguini with clam sauce was good and the ribeye was tender.  There was no delay in service and the waitstaff were attentive.

6/11/2009,"Santa Barbara, CA","Update September 2013Since my original review (see below) in 2009 the Boathouse has improved significantly. It is now a solid 3-star performer with an extra star for the great location. The food is basic California fare and the quality is good. I would not come here for the food alone but after spending time on the beach this is a very good spot.Original Review from 6/11/2009 The location is still great, but after last year's remodel it  has been obviously designed to maximize revenue from undiscerning tourists. Before the remodel it was called ""Brown Pelican"" and was inconsistent but had atmosphere and a good breakfast. Now it's plain bad. It gets the two stars only for the fantastic location. The menu consists of a very limited selection of tourist standards (mostly fried and with the identical cocktail sauce on everything), the quality is average. The best thing I can say about the service is that I felt pity for the kids for being so bored with their jobs.

5/28/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","of course I agree with everyone else that the location is idyllic.  I went for a girls' luncheon with two friends and I did find the service a slow,  but friendly.  I had a Cesar salad which was excellent, and the dungeness crab cake appetizer which was also very tasty. the one thing which I was disappointed about would have to be the cocktail I ordered.  It was the blood orange margarita.  The description on the menu was wonderful:  ""El Charro 100% Agave Tequila, fresh blood orange juice, fresh lime, Triple Sec and a splash of sweet and sour. Served on the rocks with a salted rim.""  but it just tasted like straight tequila... and I do like a strong drink.  I guess I got my money's worth in liquor, but not really because I couldn't even finish it.  Just way too strong.  I had recently enjoyed amazing drinks at the SB Fishhouse down on Cabrillo which I believe is the same owner, and so my expectations were high for the cocktail.  Oh well.  I felt like the waitress was just too rushed and I didnt have the heart to send it back.  beautiful setting.  service was a bit lax.  great food.  i will go back again for a special occasion !",3 star rating,Labor B.

There was also the occasional scent of sewage that wafted in through out dinner, but everything else made it easy to overlook.

6/6/2009,"Oxnard, CA","I had high expectations for The Boathouse after recommendations and reviews from friends but was sorely disappointed in their wait staff and my own food. Even though I called and made reservations (that were approved by a manager and written on the list) they weren't set up when we arrived and we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, the server did not arrive to take drink orders for almost 15 minutes. Drinks were not refilled at all during our visit. We had to ask a busboy to refill our water glasses. Our food took quite a while to arrive once we had ordered. While the other people in my party were satisfied, my food was not to order. The burger was quite rare despite my request for medium and we did not have the time (due to our wait) to have it remade. I also did not see our server again until the check came. They charge gratuity for parties of 6 or more and if I was paying, would have refused to pay the full gratuity. The service was slow, unresponsive, and almost non-existent.",2 star rating,Emily R.

7/29/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I went for a late lunch last Friday (my husband, daughter and I).  We waited 20 minutes which we didn't mind because we can take our dog for a walk first.  We were seated in the area to the right of the host stand right in the middle.  We received water from the robotic busser, no eye contact, nothing.  Then no one acknowledged we were there.  There were at least two waiters in this small area and no one even looked at us.  It was very frustrating because we could see all the waiters congregating around the kitchen.  After 15 minutes I waved someone down and she said she would take our order for our server.  Then we waited another 10-15 min. before our server greeted us and finally got our drink order!  She was very nice and chatted us up but I was so disappointed!  I am in the business and my family complains that I can be too picky but this was just plain bad costumer service.  We live close by and love bringing people here but I will think twice before coming back.  I know I should have said something to the manager but by the time we got our meal (at least an hour after we were seated), we had to rush  because we had to be somewhere.",2 star rating,Anne W.
5/11/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","We ordered fries and an ice-cream at the snackbar attached to the Boathouse, where food is cooked in the Boathouse kitchen and served by Boathouse waitstaff, and proceeded to sit at one of the tables located next to the snack bar window.  Another couple was eating their Boathouse take-out food there at another table.  A server had just finished her burger there.  After a 25 minute wait for our fries and ice-cream, a man in a button down blue shirt and several servers came out and told us they needed to move our tables to the bar for happy hour.  The couple who were eating said they would be done in 10 minutes and we (myself, a 39 week pregnant lady and her daughter - on Mother's Day!!) told him we had been waiting for 25 minutes for our food from their snack bar and that we would appreciate if we could have a table to sit at to eat.  We were told no - we all had to get up as they needed the tables immediately and that we had not ordered from the restaurant so we did not get to sit at their table (which was clearly at the snack bar).  There was another dirty, smaller table in the corner that was being unused and I asked if we could use that table and was told NO - they needed that one, too.  So, pregnant lady and child and eating couple were literally kicked out of tables we had been occupying to eat our $4 fries which came from their kitchen.  I told the manager that I thought they handled this situation in a rude manner, as all we needed was another 10 minutes or so to eat their food there, and he replied - I don't see how I could have done this in a less rude way.  It was now 30 minutes after the time we ordered and paid.  I could not believe how rude and bad the customer service of the manager and multiple servers were who took away the tables and chairs literally out from under the other couple - who were in the middle of eating their Boathouse meals, and a 39 week pregnant lady on Mother's day with her child who had been waiting 30 minutes for their food.",1 star rating,Joanna T.

7/8/2012,"Burbank, CA","I try to avoid restaurants on the beach at all costs, because I know they will be overpriced and packed full of patrons regardless of how mediocre the food or service is.  It was kind of refreshing to find the Boathouse after searching the internet, because it was on a list of restaurants with the best view in Santa Barbara.  The food prices were truly reasonable for solid seafood choices and again considering that it is on the beach and packed to the point that diners without a reservation were waiting about an hour for a table.  The problem was that after ordering a massive amount of seafood, we found that everything tasted just ok.  This is hardly even casual restaurant quality food as far as taste goes.  My mother said it was the worst salmon she ever had.  She also noticed that there was a whole family of flies living on the window with the great beach view.  My mother always looks at waiters' uniforms as a sign of hygiene and she noticed that all the waiter's uniforms, not just one or two people, were really dirty with huge stains on some of them.  In hindsight, the reasonable prices are not worth it considering that the food is solidly mediocre. The service was solidly mediocre as well, to the point where our waiter disappeared for long stretches and we had to ask other waiters to get things.",2 star rating,Manyak S.

8/17/2009,"Paso Robles, CA","Great location and views, but that's pretty much it. I do also want to say I did have a wonderful waitress who was very understanding about our complaints. Let me start out first with the wine list. We were very dissapointed with the selections. We are surrounded by some of the most wonderful vineyards and fine wines and they only had ones that I could go to the local market and buy for $12.99. Sorry to be so harsh but that 's the truth. We did finally decide on one that was just okay and said we would make the best of it. Then it just went downhill . We ordered our entress which were a rib-eye steak and shrimp scampi . We received our soup and salad promptly from our waitress. The wait for our food was about 50 minutes. A food runner literally dropped off our food and just left. My friend and I both looked at each other and then at our dinners and couldn't believe what they had just served us. The rib-eye which we ordered medium was maybe half the size of my hand and about an 1/8 inch thick and pretty close to rare, also everything from the mashed potatoes to the vegies were just luke warm. This was suppose to be a nice thick, juicy  steak!  What happenned?  The scampi sauteed like a stir fry with onions, brocolli ,red & green peppers served on a bed of rice. If I wanted stir fry I would have gone to a chinese restaurant. There was no garlic or butter to be found in site! Also this entree too was just barely luke warm. Finally our waitress came to check on us about 10 minutes later and we did complain to her. She was very apologetic. She gave us the menu again and said she would be back to see what else she would be able to get for us. At that point 2 hours had gone by and we were so done. Very dissapointed we decided to let our waitress know we were not interested . Surprisingly we did receive a bill for the wine and at the time just decided to cut our losses and take care of the bill and our waitress. I felt like since we were there for so long we owed rent!

7/6/2010,"St Petersburg, FL","On the advice of our B&B manager, we had lunch here so we could watch the dogs frolic in the waves at the dog-friendly beach it sits atop.  We would have preferred to sit outside, but the place was busy and we were hungry!  I ordered the shrimp ceviche, and the portion was very large, the shrimp was fresh, and the flavors were good.  I've had plenty of ceviche in my life, and this wasn't the best, but it was good.  I think I would have preferred it if it had more of a combination of seafood, and not just shrimp.  I honestly can't remember what my boyfriend ate, which leads me to believe it wasn't memorable.  That's neither good nor bad.  I know he didn't complain.  The decor is what you would expect from the name, with pictures of boating adorning the wall, and colors and woods meant to be reminiscent of being on a yacht.  Best of all, though, was the location.  My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed watching beachgoers brave the wind and the waves to attempt an afternoon dip in the ocean.  We ended up walking down the rocky shore after lunch and lazing on a rock while we digested.  It was an enjoyable experience, and the lunch was just right for what we needed.",3 star rating,Megan D.

Its not exactly tomato sauce and its not exactly tomato soup - Its the perfect stew w tomato garlic and seafood juices.... yummy yummy yummy!Not a usual fan of fish tacos (tastes too americanized) but these were good - there are 2 big tacos so you can figure out how to split among 4 people..... Er?Ceviche was good but not enough fish and too much cabbage... Why cabbage in a ceviche?!? Why?!? (Or was it lettuce... Dont remember). Pasta - ample amount of seafood w good marinara cream sauceWe were stuffed and chilled on the beach after! The only downside: i had to tell them to place toilet seat covers like 3 times to 3 diff ppl until they finally put it in. Really, do i need to wait like 30 min just to go to the bathroom?

Had the mahi mahi as well as the sea bass for main courses and the coconut shrimp and crab cakes for appetizers. All was very delicious and cooked perfect with amazing flavors. We sat indoors because the patio was super crowded. Indoor though you have amazing views from any angle. And by night you dont need to be outside because you can't see much after too long anyways!

I came to Boathouse with my friends to celebrate are first semester in college. We sat down and weren't helping for about a half n hour. I think the problem had to do with the fact that we were younger than everyone else having dinner there, so obviously we were not their top priority. But regardless of that I expect to be served as if I'm as important as the people next to us. I got the Steak Frites which was very bland and not as big as a portion that I would expect for how much I was paying. The truffle fries were really good though. My friend got the Lobster Mac n cheese, but she didn't like it because there was way too much lobster and not enough Mac n cheese. My other friend got the wedge salad and clam chowder. She said the clam chowder was really good, but not the wedge salad.

I wouldn't recommend coming for too much more than drinks and appetizers before your real meal elsewhere. Service is not great. You may be asked to wait for a bit while you stare at available tables. The manager (whom doesn't tuck his shirt in) and the hostesses chase each other around the restaurant playing grab-a$$. This may be the Santa Barbara way of life but if you are in Santa Barbara visiting you can probably find a better spot to enjoy a nice meal.",3 star rating,Yolanda P.

9/8/2013,"New York, NY","While waiting in the morning, my friends and I sat on the beach watching lifegaurds-to be training, nice eye candy. We also saw dolphins swimming off the shore. As for the food: I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich. The ahi was perfectly seared. The pineapple and avocado accompanied the tuna so well!! The bread was nice and toasty. Large portions. I saved half of the sandwich later that day. It was just as good later. The breakfast potatoes: buttery and fabulous flavor with the bell peppers Overall great brunch and cute location",4 star rating,McKenna G.

It was offered when I ordered my food, I didn't think it would cost extra until I got the check. When I asked the server about it, she simply stated, ""it says it in the menu."" I think they should also tell you when you're ordering that it cost extra, because sometimes people miss little things that are ""in the menu"".",3 star rating,Alysha V.

10/22/2012,"Los Altos, CA","Great place to go for brunch or happy hour on a sunny day (call ahead to put your name on the list as this place gets busy).  Since it is tucked away on Hendry's beach, away from the tourist locations downtown, it is mostly locals who go here to hangout.  The ambience couldn't be better (the outdoor patio is quite large...be sure to sit there to enjoy the weather and hear the waves).The food is good, but not necessaily great (I have yet to get a true craving for anything I have eaten there).  My favorite brunch item is the Signature breakfast...like eggs benedict, but with crab cakes and avocado instead of ham and english muffins.The service isn't the best....everyone is super nice, but it is very slow.  Plan on spending the extra time enjoying an another cocktail or cup of coffee.",4 star rating,Paikea K.

5/3/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I have heard about the great views at this restaurant and was looking forward to a fabulously romantic evening dining al freco on the patio.I had made a reservation and had asked for a table as close to the ocean as possible.  We were seated at a table a bit in the middle. Kind of disappointing, but we still had a table with a view.  It was breezy and we didn't have a heater by our table so my date asked if we could move to a table next to a heater, which we did and were much more comfortable.We had a very personable waitress named ""Liz"" and she explained the specials of the day.  We ordered a bottle of the Lindcourt Pinot Noir and shared the calimari with the chipotle aioli.  We asked Liz if we could have it lightly breaded and she agreed. It came out lightly breaded and the chipotle aioli had a wonderful spicy kick. We also shared the wedge salad, which had so much blue cheese and was completely dredged in blue cheese dressing that we asked Liz if we could have more lettuce and she quickly brought out another wedge of lettuce.We were contemplating ordering an entree, but we were so full from the calimari and wedge salad that we decided to just chat and finish our wine, but then a waiter came up to us and told us he was going to move the heater.  My date said that we would be cold and he said to us that we were being selfish.  Say What?  My date told him that this establishment needed to purchase more heaters.  He then proceeded to move the heater.  I doubt we will revisit this restaurant.",3 star rating,Vida K.

3/15/2013,"McKinney, TX","The view, the view, the view. That pretty much sums it up for this restaurant. It is literally right on the beach, so just about every seat in the place has a spectacular view. We came here for breakfast from a recommendation and had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table as it was crazy crowded. That was ok as we just took a nice stroll on the beach!Here's where the 3 stars comes in. I totally understand it was crowded but it took forever for our waitress to finally stop by and even order out drinks. Our food took just as long to get-again, probably because it was really crowded.  I ordered the banana pancakes with fruit. The pancakes were fluffy and soft, very tasty. the coffee was just regular coffee, nothing too spectacular. If you don't mind the wait, this is definitely one of those local favorites to try while in SB.",3 star rating,Shelly P.

9/12/2018,"Hermosa Beach, CA","My review is regarding the Boathouse seating policy. At least two to three times a year my sisters and I plan a weekend out of town together. We drive from the South Bay with our first stop being the Boathouse. We happily enter the beach front restaurant and see an empty table at the edge of the patio. Upon approaching the hostess about sitting at the available table we are informed that we cannot. ""It is reserved."" Seriously - reservations are not accepted (at least not on weekends.). What we've heard it that the water front tables are reserved for locals. Are you kidding me?  The locals can go anytime of the week. Out-of-town guests usually must go on weekends. So the table sits empty because someone MIGHT want it that lives local. We've had this happen several times (continuing to come hoping the policy has changed). Apparently if hasn't. So be it. Boathouse can continue to cater to the locals and we will probably not return. We are tired of that policy and treatment.",2 star rating,Pamela A.

9/9/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Really nice location and great food. If you're looking to have dinner near the water, but away from the tourists, this is pretty much the best choice.

7/17/2018,"Tucson, AZ",lovely location right on the beach ...but food has a lot to improve in order to get more than two stars....we ordered oysters rockefeller to start...there was some lump of solid gelled spinach /egg thing on top of overcooked oyster..one of the oysters was very bad....not fresh/light with creamy sauce and spinach....way overcooked and yucky....My sand dabs had been slathered in a ton of jerk seasoning totally obliterating the taste of the delicate fish - it should have been done in brown butter / lemon butter w capers but presentation was so overdone w seasoning it totally overpowered the fish.  I had to ask it to be redone without that seasoning...they brought me plain unseasoned fish which while better than overseasoning was extremely bland and unimpressive...no creative thought.  I could cook them better. Hubby's mahi mahi was way overcooked /dry...uninspiring....dont come here for the food is my summary.,2 star rating,Elisa F.
10/1/2014,"Ventura, CA","I was in Santa Barbara for the day working and wanted to get a bite to eat in a nice place with good food and near the water. I looked on Yelp and saw a good amount of good reviews on the place so I decided to give them a try. What I thought was going to be a good experience turned out to be the worst restaurant experience I have EVER encountered in my 40 years of life. The hostess that seated me was very nice but when I was finally seated was when the problem started. First of all, I had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me now mind you, there were not a lot of customers inside but there were plenty of waiters and waitresses standing around and talking amongst each other. This one waiter in particular (about 5""9, Hispanic, black hair with mustache and goatee) was talking with the customers (well they appeared to be customers) that were seated next to me. Was he taking their orders or discussing anything about their meal? No, he was talking to them about boating in Catalina. In addition,  these ""customers"" had no food or plates on their table (they were sitting there when I arrived) so either they ate already or didn't care about ordering anything. I finally waved my hand and got his attention. His response?  ""I will be with you when I'm finished talking!"" Me being appalled at his response got the attention of a nearby waitress and asked to speak with the manager. At this time, the waiter came to my table and asked if he could help me. I then told him how rude and unprofessional that was to blow off a customer in that manner. His response, ""You were being rude to interrupt while I was talking. "" I then said that I'm a customer and the customer comes first. He said that they were customers, too, and I told him that he was not taking their order or doing anything you would normally do for a customer but he was chopping it up with them about Catalina. He had no response to that and asked me again pretty abruptly and rude if he could help me. I told him that I no longer wished to eat there and that I would speak with his manager. I spoke with the manager, Michael, and explained the situation to him. He was very apologetic and offered to ""make things right"" by taking my order but was double talking me because with the same breath he said that he was sitting nearby and that I was not there for 10 minutes and added that her knew that it might have ""felt long."" Wow, so I get the rudest and most unprofessional waiter in history and then the manager wants to insult my intelligence? Well, you can guess what I did next. I left and vowed to never return to that place. I ended up going to my regular spot in Ventura called the Aloha Steakhouse. Customer service is very impeccable there and I did not mind giving my waitress that $20 tip. She deserved it. As for Boathouse, which I will now call Slophouse because of the very poor customer service I received, do yourself a favor and condemn the place or take customer service training more seriously.",1 star rating,Robin B.

I went for breakfast both times.  I had savory the first time, and sweet the second time.  The coffee is good as well.  I would say the food is not the main draw, but I will continue to go because the location is so good and honestly its not too expensive.",4 star rating,Cindy R.

The lobster tacos are my favorite! Definitely get the calamari as well. Whether you live in the area and want to show your guests a good time or if you're passing through, go here, you won't be disappointed! Tip #1: I've been here on different days of the week (including weekends) and during happy hour it gets very busy so if you want a seat in the outside bar area be sure to get there early or be patient...your time will come!Tip #2: They tend to hire pretty servers so for all you single guys out there you can look forward to more than one good view!",5 star rating,Lexi M.

Would have probably given it two stars at the time, but I have found to appreciate this place for it's strengths. Enjoy the view, have a few drinks (their cocktails are very good), and order an appetizer or two. That's the recipe for a good time here. I wouldn't bother eating a meal here...food is just not that good compared to other places in SB. I have heard the brunch is pretty good, but haven't tried yet. I now happily enjoy the Boathouse for what it is..a fun, lively place to enjoy a few drinks with friends and take in the beauty of one of the best beaches in all of SB.",3 star rating,Ryan L.

It reminds me of Manhattan chowder with lots of clams.  For dinner, we dined outside at night, and the heat lamps kept us toasty warm. It was packed. The service and wine selection is excellent. I had the corn chowder with Ahi Tuna and my husband had a pasta dish with seafood. The next morning I begged my husband to take me back for more of their soup.

I'm a little disappointed about the lack fo seasoning on the shrimp...could have been better. The steak had NO seasoning...thank you A1 for saving the day.

4/7/2016,"Goleta, CA","I've eaten lunch here before but have been wanting to try breakfast for a while. It was spring break week and the kids were away. Last day before the kids were due back, I finally decided to take my husband here on this perfect Friday morning, April 1st. When we arrived, we spotted front parking. We walked right up to the restaurant... decided we could do either an outside or inside table but then ultimately decided on an outside table. We were handed a pager by the hostess. I did not bother to ask how long the wait was or how many people were in front of us at the time because there was no apparent line or people waiting around. People who came after us were seated and or took seats at the bar and it did not occur to me there was going to be an issue with seating. After a while, as more people started to show and tables started to become available, people were being called to be seated but I was still waiting, so naturally I started to be concerned (i.e. did they forget about me?). I walked up to one of the hostesses and asked how many people were a head of me. To my surprise, there were two parties still ahead of me and this is after I've witnessed two parties who arrived shortly after me seated right away and two parties just recently seated as the tables became available. Now there are two more ahead of me! I was SHOCKED! So I asked just exactly how many were a head of me when I arrived and of course we don't know now because we've already seated a bunch of people by now. One of the hostesses said if we don't mind sitting inside, she could seat us right away. At this point, we had waited almost 45 minutes (believe or not!) and I was getting hangry. So we decided to just sit inside. As soon as the waitress approached, we told her we were ready to order our food as we've been waiting outside for awhile. She was very understanding. She took our orders right away. We ordered the Boathouse Signature Breakfast and the Boathouse Omelette. Both were delicious! Our experience after being seated went well. However, the whole experience starts with the hostess. From the greeting to setting expectations, the hostess has one of the most important roles. This could have been a perfect 5 stars but because I felt we were being discriminated by the hostess (yes, I hate playing that card but that was my logical conclusion), I had to give this only 2 stars. And of course, I told everyone about my bad experience as well. Yes, so sad :-(",2 star rating,Lady D.
