2/16/2021,"El Monte, CA","I loved this place. Very outdoorsy and accommodating to dogs. The outside seating was very comfortable and spaced out appropriately with COVID restrictions. I ordered the lamb burger with was very good. I love feta cheese personally. And my girlfriend got the bacon burger which was, well exactly what it says. For appetizers we ordered the brussel sprouts which have a small sweet flavor because of the vinaigrette I believe. That was my favorite. And we also ordered the Mac and Cheese which I'm bias too because I love me my Mac and cheese. Overall, love the environment. And would definitely come back. On busy night, be sure to wait there in person. Only 5 groups are allowed on a waitlist at a time. So get there early!",5 star rating,Sherman C.
5/23/2021,"Scottsdale, AZ",This cafe has outstanding service and food! Lovely patio with welcomingIng servers. We had the fried chicken and the ribs ( fall off the bone delicious!) We loved the entire meal and were so satiated that we had to pass on their flourless chocolate cake! Yum!,5 star rating,Janice L.
4/15/2021,"San Francisco, CA",Very good food I understand why it was so sought after! Would go back again! No reservations and you have to put you nameOn a paper list and then wait nearby - they made it very clear if you don't hear your name called then they move on to the next one. Seems very flawed especially when we called to ask if we can put our name down and then walk around the town and they said yes only to change their mind in person.Overall the waiting experience 2.5/5 but the service once we got to the table was 5/5!,5 star rating,JD E.
5/15/2021,"Brea, CA","My girlfriend and I came to this place with our dogs and immediately the environment was welcoming! It's hard to say how busy it would get because we came on a weekday afternoon. I had the Benedict and my girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich. Both were extremely juicy, savory, and excellent! We complimented our dishes with a Bloody Mary and a drink called Mandarin Smash. I would highly recommend these drinks - the bartender definitely knows how to make some pretty damn good drinks! I would recommend this place if you're in Solvang - lunch or dinner. We are definitely coming back here!",5 star rating,Andrew C.
5/5/2021,"Claremont, CA","Another solvang trip means another visit to Succulent. Coming to this restaurant is always a must for my sister and I. We love it here. We even try to recreate some of their dishes at home when we miss Succulent Cafe. LOL.In my most recent visit, I ordered the vegan chili, my sister ordered the Caesar salad and the mini biscuits. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The food came out super fast. And we were seated quickly too which was a plus. As always, we had a splendid time at Succulent.",5 star rating,Kristine D.
5/4/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","The Succulent Biscuit (10/10) - cinnamon cumin pulled pork, bacon gravy, pineapple chutneyI LOVED this menu item. It was everything I could have possibly wanted from a brunch breakfast. It's not what I normally order, but that's the reason why I love this dish so much! It is very flavorful with the slather of bacon gravy on top and freshly topped with a pineapple taste.  It's new, interesting, and fantastic!Would go back!! I enjoyed the vibes of this cafe. Good service. I love my friends because we understand that whatever we order we all need to try a bit of each. LOL I got to try the eggs benedict, which was very solid as well. I'd rate this place 4.75/5  because the food is GREAT but I don't know if it's crave-worthy. It's just another great dine-in restaurant.",5 star rating,Karen U.
4/15/2021,"Bakersfield, CA","While on our way to dinner we walked past this adorable restaurant and stopped to have a cocktail and appy. The outdoor space was just absolutely fabulous and the perfect way to spend the early evening. We had the opportunity to sit next to a lovely family with the cutest little four month old pup.For cocktails I opted for a simple margarita that was well balanced. Just enough sweet and tart. While the boyfriend went for the Tennessee Mule. Yelp directed us to their bacon wrapped diver scallops and we were not disappointed. Service was prompt and friendly, even though they were extremely busy. We couldn't have asked for a better pre-dinner spot!",5 star rating,McKenzie S.
5/24/2021,"Bakersfield, CA","Excellent service, great food, and cute atmosphere! It's like you're eating in a secrete garden surrounded by succulents and various plants. The food arrived in a timely manner and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the preparation. The Cali Benedict was perfectly cooked and the spicy fried chicken with biscuit and gravy was flavorful. Would definitely visit again.",5 star rating,J K.
5/23/2021,"Long Beach, CA","Meh. The food here didn't match the prices they charged. Most things tasted like they came from a frozen food box. We had dinner and wine. The wine was good of course! But the food was lacking. The scallop appetizers were dry and lacked flavor. Again, they tasted like they came from a box of frozen scallops.  The pasta was just okay.  This place seems to lack any and all the love in the cooking. And for what they charged us, no way I will come back. The venue is nice and I like the outdoor setting. Wait staff was very friendly and on point. Come on guys! FIX THE FOOD!! Shall I call Gordon Ramsey?",2 star rating,Gary N.
2/13/2021,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","Wait was more then 45 min and I'mSo glad we waited because the breakfast was amazing. French toast had such a unique taste and it was so soft melted in your mouth. The Cali eggs Benedict was layered with amazing flavored. Avocado, tomato, grilled onions top with perfectly cooked eggs and delicious hollandaise sauce. Kids enjoyed there chicken tenders fries and fresh fruit. Must try place when visiting Solvang!!! Not to mention our waitress was so friendly and sweet!",5 star rating,Anna S.
5/21/2021,"San Jose, CA","Two reviews in one.  First, we arrived in Solvang and needed a good dinner, but wanted to stay in.  Called and ordered the Bacon Burger and Cobb Salad (Turkey Roasted in house BTW with fresh made house ranch dressing), ready in 15 minutes and was amazing!!!!!  Second, after waiting in line for 15 minutes at the brewery next store, we decided enough and went to Succulents for lunch the next day.  NOT disappointed...my wife, after seeing my bacon burger, ordered again, I had the Meatloaf Sammie...WOW, on sourdough with tomato Jam!!  Soooo good!  We had salads with the amazing fresh made ranch dressing.  If in Solvang - a must eat location!",5 star rating,Kurt L.

11/27/2020,"Downey, CA","Succulent Cafe in Solvang, CA, was a great choice for takeout during our recent visit on 11/23/20.The usual COVID-19 provisions were in place.The staff was nice in person. A bit indifferent on the phone plus they put me on hold for longer than anticipated, but at least they accepted phone-in orders, right? ...by the way, I checked all the usual apps, but the only one that had SC on its dining list said they were too busy to accept online orders. This was at approximately 5PM.Plastic is accepted. You can, however, ask to pay over the phone to minimize the amount of hands that touch your card. The wait for our order was well over the 15-20 minute estimate I was given over the phone. The food was definitely worth it, though.FOOD+ vegan chili ($18) - ""topped with avocado, red onion & cilantro our chili has black beans, quinoa, corn, walnuts, bell pepper, tomato & Chipotle spice""... sometimes, especially this year, I just don't feel carnivorous. It was really tasty.+ bacon burger ($18) - one of my kiddos had this... I was surprised she ate the limp, undercooked bacon (bleh!)+ kids mac n' cheese ($10.50) - the fries that were chosen as a side for this dish and that came with the burger were for some reason really good... even when they got cold. Missing was a cookie that they had on their menu.+ Dr. Pepper ($3)+ 2 kid-sized milks ($2 apiece)I heard that they provide a good charcuterie, but didn't see it on their online menu.They offer beer, wine, and cocktails.They also have a dog-friendly patio.Overall, good choice for a good dinner when in Solvang.",4 star rating,Jenni M.

9/14/2020,"San Jose, CA","We were hungry and wanted to dine at one of the more popular places in the heart of Solvang since we were first time visitors to the town.  Succulent Cafe had pretty dope Yelp reviews so we walked over to add our name to the waiting list.  We were called up by the hostess for seating within 15 minutes.  They have a huge patio in which tables and chairs are as socially distant spaced out as possible.We ordered two items from the kid's menu (chicken tenders), one Cobb salad, one Vegan beyond burger, and one fried chicken and gravy biscuit.  I had a bite of everything and nothing stood out to me -- it was just average lunch food.  Nothing fancy, unique, or with a special twist.  Perhaps the dinner menu is more impressive?  One final thing to note:  their ""fresh lemonade"" was definitely not freshly squeezed.  It was concentrated juice that was way too tart and the only reason why we were able to drink ours was because we diluted them with iced water.I give them props for working through the madness of COVID19 restrictions, but I just wasn't wow'd from the food experience.",3 star rating,Sonya E.

8/23/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","An afternoon visit to Solvang after some wine tastings landed our hungry group here. A few friends in this group happen to be annoying...ahem...sorry, I meant ""vegan"" ;) So, we did some pre-research before landing on Succulent, which seemed to have a great menu to suit all.Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, and even a later lunch time (around 3:30pm) unfortunately runs risk of overlapping with shift change as well, so the only thing we had to deal with a bit of chaotic questions and unknowns of when our table of 5 would be ready. They don't do text alerts; you just have to make sure you're right there.Luckily, we scored a table (even after a walk around the block)...and it was all smooth sailing from there.Service was on point. Santiizer spray (right on the table) was on point. Great drinks/wine list, and a solid menu. We got the mini biscuits for the table to share at my behest and let's just say it will make you say, good LAWD. These things, be it with the house jam or butter...SO delectable. We're still dreaming about them.I was starving so just got the burger...but was stunned how well cooked it was, how crisp the fries were, etc. My vegan friends opted for the 'Beyond' versions...ok fine, I'm convinced. After a few bites, I can see why this meat alternative really is something special (even better than the 'Impossible' versions I've tried elsewhere). I made the assumption only a place that knows how to work with this, or gets enough orders, could execute as well as they do here.Rolled out of Succulent feeling happy and satisfied. What more can you ask?",4 star rating,Jen E.
1/31/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","One of the best restaurants of Solvang. Breakfast is delicious and savory! The attention to detail on their food, drinks, and customer service makes this place superb!",5 star rating,Dee A.
1/24/2021,"San Diego, CA",Went here back in August for a birthday dinner! Love the way they have this place decorated (at the time we were only able to eat outside). I'm sure they are now closed for dine in at all. Hopefully they can open again soon once these restrictions are lifted. Amazing selection of cocktails here. Mine of choice is typically an Old Fashioned and they made it very well! Had one of my favorites for dessert too and cracked the sugary crust of a delicious Creme Brûlée. Some of the best I've had! Highly recommend this place! I'm sure this place is open for take out...support your local small businesses and order here for take out. You won't regret it!,5 star rating,Justin B.
3/25/2021,"Fullerton, CA","Our stay in Solvang included dinner at Succulent Cafe.  I had done a bit of research prior to our trip and one thing caught my eye on Succulent's menu, the Vegan Chili. Upon my ordering the Vegan Chili my dinner mates were astonished. They know me to be a staunch and dedicated meat eater. But, I am also curious about all things Chili. Just how good could a vegan chili be? I must admit, the Vegan Chili at Succulent Cafe is very good. The chili is just the right mix of heat and spice. The beans, avocado, walnuts and corn are culinary dense enough to give substance to the chili in the manner of a non-vegan chili. The chipotle spice is right for the chili, enough to infuse it with  warmth, but also let the vegetables shine.The Vegan Chili was served with vegan cornbread. The cornbread was good. However, I would have enjoyed the cornbread to have been served with a honey spread. I know butter is not vegan. ""I can't Believe It's Not Butter"" has a vegan version. I would go with that.",4 star rating,joe b.
6/21/2020,"Simi Valley, CA","On our first day trip since the Coronavirus Safer at Home time, we took our grandson up to the Santa Ynez Valley.  We spent a little while in Los Olivos, then moved on to Solvang. After picking up some baked goods and poking in to a couple shops, it was time to think of an early dinner.Courtesy of Yelp, I was able to find a few options for open restaurants with outdoor seating.  That led to trying Succulent Cafe.  By the time we arrived, a late afternoon breeze was kicking up, and the temperature was dropping.  We opted to sit inside, and for a time, we were the only ones in the dining room.  They did have the tables spaced out to maintain distancing. The tables had spray bottles of hand sanitizer, which was helpful.  They lacked any decor, so the austerity wasn't very interesting. Our server had a mask, which she wore under her nose.  Sigh.  She, and others on the staff, were wearing gloves. We saw tables being cleaned with disinfectant. I ordered their soup of the day - vegetarian bean soup.  Flavorful and hearty, it got a thumbs up from me.  It packed a bit of heat.  Our server said it was probably from paprika. Brought half home to save room for the pasta picatta I'd ordered.  While tasty, it was heavy-handed, with a lot of capers, and a cream based lemony sauce.  I was expecting a lighter touch of lemon, butter, and a splash of white wine.  I'd have skipped the calories of the cream, personally. Dear Hubby ordered a pulled pork sandwich. While filling, he reported that the taste wasn't special.  ""Pedestrian"", he stated later.  He did enjoy his craft beer a lot, which offered a mango flavor.Adored Grandson enjoyed the mac and cheese appetizer, adding optional bacon.  He pronounced it very good.All in all, we all got fed, just not in a very memorable fashion.  Middle of the road fare in a setting that's definitely more interesting outside than inside.",3 star rating,Lianne K.

6/27/2020,"El Dorado Hills, CA",Julie was our waitress. Super friendly and efficient. I really appreciate her and the staff to have to work under masked conditions. Hopefully this will end soon! We sat outside so no need for masks. Now on to my review! Everything we ate was really yummy. I had the pulled pork sandwich served with fries and a mustard coleslaw. I don't care for mustard in my Cole slaw so not a fan of that. The pulled pork and bbq sauce was so good. Ask for extra sauce as it's that good. A slight kick to it but not too spicy. My hubby tried the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. The sauce was to die for! Loved the potato dumplings they sit on too. Such a cute little place in a cute little town. Will come back when we are in the area again. Great place to stay as well on our way down to visit our son at UCSB.,5 star rating,Juls B.
7/23/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","We needed something delicious to eat in our hotel room this evening.  Succulent Cafe is a couple of blocks away with a tasty menu.  We opted for the Crispy Brussel Sprouts at $14.  They were covered with shredded aged parmesan, Applewood smoked bacon and fig balsamic reduction.  The portion was huge and clearly hit the spot.  The Brussel sprouts were bursting with flavor, the balsamic reduction took the dish to the next level.  This is a very good dish.While Succulent Cafe gets 4 stars on Yelp what we had in our hotel room this evening was 5 stars.  I'm going to return trying more dishes here to see if the balance of their menu falls into the 5 star realm.Thank you for a lovely savory treat.",5 star rating,Jay A.

4/7/2021,"South El Monte, CA","Stopped by on a Wednesday morning because upon arrival on Tuesday they were closed? And cause Paula's was packed. And little did we know it was the best case scenario. Great little place with lots of Succulents obviously lol. We were attended fairly quick but our food took 40 mins to arrive at our table because our receipt was lost. Sarah, the waiter, said the drinks were on the house because of this mistake/misplacement. So I'm glad they made up the error cause it sucked seeing everyone after us get their food even though we ordered before everyone. The food was amazing. Loved the Cali Eggs I got they were very flavorful and top notch. Would 1000% recommended them! Especially poached! My girlfriend had the French Toast and she said it was good. Wasn't too sweet with the whip cream. Definitely a good amount of food. The drinks were also great 10/10.",5 star rating,Eduardo T.

4/25/2021,"Canyon Country, CA","So we stumbled across this spot by chance since what we originally wanted had a ridiculous waiting time. The ambiance was nice and very tranquil setting. The outdoor patio dining experience was nice. The succulents all around the property made complete sense hence the name. I can't really knock this place but in my book it's a 3.5. I ordered the Vegan burger which was a monster size portion. It came with a side and your options are, fries, coleslaw, salad or fruit. I played it safe and got fries. My husband ordered the pulled pork with pineapple chutney. He was very pleased with his choice.  His food seemed much more adventurous and flavorful. We ordered their Ahumada margaritas and it was not a good choice for my liking. I like smoky mezclas but this drink was a bit too much. I should have played it safe with the mimosa. They offer plenty of drinks. They have a big selection on alcoholic beverages. It was nice to try but I'm not sure I would come back.",4 star rating,Wendy R.

10/26/2020,"Glendale, CA","Arrived in Solvang on a Sunday morning and the town was very crowded as more people are venturing out to keep from going quarantine-crazy. It's difficult to choose a brunch spot in the area because there are so many options. Even though Paula's Pancake House seemed to be the most popular restaurant for breakfast, we selected Succulent Cafe based on the fact that they have a separate to-go order window. Outdoor AND indoor dining are now allowed in the area but I still opt for to-go anytime I can. There is no wait for a table, the food comes out quickly, and you can find an outdoor table at a number of spots nearby that are less crowded (and hence less risky).I had the shortrib hash n' eggs (braised short rib, peppers, onions, potatoes, and two poached eggs). The food came out within 15-20 minutes after ordering and there was absolutely no line for to-go orders. Score! When the food came out, we then walked across the street and find a nice, non-crowded table to dine at outdoors! The short rib was so tender, juicy and flavorful! The potatoes were delicious and well-seasoned as well. I would definitely recommend Succulent Cafe as a great breakfast option if you're in need of some good food and don't want to wait 40 minutes for a table.",4 star rating,Kimberly B.

I liked their vegan options, the vegan burger was pretty juicy and tasty and the vegan chili was delicious. The watermelon kombucha was fairly interesting too ( and in a good way ) . The one thing I wasn't happy about was our server, she disappeared halfway through our meal and without letting us know, which was very unprofessional. She also didn't give us a good recommendation on the wine , I ended up not drinking mine because I didn't like it at all. We waited very long for her , and ultimately wehad to call over another server who was kind enough to help us out. We wanted to order dessert but decided against it because of the service .",4 star rating,Shriya B.

1/3/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","Succulent is by far one of the most popular tourist destinations in Solvang. Whether it be for brunch or dinner, you will always find it busy on weekends. As with how busy restaurants go, there will be lines and there will be wait times. With that said, it should not deter you from trying Succulent out for yourselves. I am a biscuit lover and Succulent sure knows how to make a biscuit platter. Order the Fried Chicken Biscuit or the signature Succulent Biscuit, both amazing in taste and quality. Truly I am a fan of their breakfast. As for dinner, the options are not so much for me. A little on the pricey side and was unimpressed with the charcuterie platter. Too simple for the cost you pay even after customization. Do not let it deter you however, try for yourselves. Succulent sure knows to create an atmosphere. Lively with a cozy feel to enjoy either it be weekday or weekend.",4 star rating,Rick S.
1/1/2020,"Irvine, CA","Tom Leykis ley-kis this place. Take that for what it's worth. Some hate him. Some love him. I for one am not a fan, but his taste in food isn't entirely off.He says the burgers here are the best he's ever had, and of course we all know that if someone even vaguely famous says something, then it must be true. Right?*gag*At any rate, I came here because the boy is a Leykis fan and wanted to try what he heard was ""the best burger"" in the SYV so, why not? Decent wine menu and 805 on tap so if the food sucks, at least I can drown my sorrows in alcohol.And sure enough, the burger was just ok. High price tags very rarely ever are justified by what shows up on your plate; however, the burger was good. The meat was great quality and the produce was fresh, but it was just a burger in a fancy dress. Nothing special, just special for a moment. The chicken was also not impressive. No real flavor and cooked in a way that resembled something between a novice chef and mom's home cooking a la chef boyardee.Curry chicken salad was....odd. Just....odd. Don't order this. The salad is good. The curry chicken is good. Just not together.The service wasn't even good, almost dismissive, like they couldn't be bothered to do their job but still expected a tip. No.The best thing about this experience was the table bread, or biscuits. They smelled, felt, and tasted just like what you'd imagine would be served on a cliche farmhouse dinner table. mmmm....Tasty, tasty, cliche.So coming in for food is dependent on your tastes. Nothing is bad, and the burger was borderline good, but I'd say that overall feeling here across the board is ""forgettable.""But hey, if all you want a nice patio to sit on to drink some wine, then this place is great. If you're hungry, then I'd suggest you go somewhere else.",3 star rating,Yuki M.
9/5/2020,"Huntington Beach, CA","Succulent cafe had great reviews, and honestly the most reviews for breakfast so I had to try it! They do not accept reservations which is totally fine. The hostess was polite, the wait on a Sunday morning around 10am was about 20min. The food was delicious I ordered the succulent biscuit. The sauce was great. Although their apple cinnamon mimosa was not on the menu the server still had it made for us so we appreciate that. The 4 stars come in because aside from that nice gesture, the customer service with the serve was lacking. Very basic, minimal interaction, and I think we saw her just that one time.

The hollandaise sauce lacked some flavor, reason for the lack of star. Also when we got there, it wasn't too busy and our food took a very long time to arrive.

I shared this with my boyfriend and to be honest I didn't want to share after I ate the sandwich and fries. highly recommend, just don't expect super spicy flavors. very mild.-bourbon vanilla french toast ($13) - 3 big pieces of french toast, whipped cream, fruits and pecans. this came with butter pecan syrup, but we spilled it and they replaced it which honey or a different syrup. the one it comes with was much tastier! if you like breakfast food this was great, but for me overly sweet so I def needed something to cut (the chicken sandwich)PROS:-nice service, I even saw them bring out dog bowls-great to eat outdoors with their pretty set up-they sanitized the tables AND chairs (thank you, chairs are important!)CONS:-possible long wait times as dirty tables were left for awhile to be cleaned and turned around for the next guests-prices, much like all the restaurants in solvang were VERY overpriced for what you're getting, but this place was at least the best place for me to overspend.OVERALL:pick this place over some of the other restaurants, there's a reason why there's always a wait.",5 star rating,Jennifer Q.

11/23/2020,"Duarte, CA",We have enjoyed meals at the Succulent Cafe on several occasions while visiting Solvang. The latest visit our family enjoyed a meal outside (during Covid19) and it was a great experience. Heaters kept us warm during a chilly Nov night and we enjoyed mini biscuits with jam. Hubby and I split the bacon burger and girls had the fried chicken and Mac n cheese and pulled pork on brioche. The food is decadent and delicious. The service prompt and friendly. A great location to stop by and enjoy a good meal.,5 star rating,Liv M.

They have a ""BREAKFAST/ BRUNCH"" menu but will only allow you to either take the poached eggs, which is what they offer for all of their egg meals, or, if you don't like poached- you can have scrambled... NO FRIED EGGS ALLOWED!?! WTF??? Also, they have fries, burgers, tenders... but ranch or ketchup only!! Honey mustard is what I requested for my tenders b/c DUH!!! I'd say 75% of tender lovers enjoy honey mustard but guess what... this place has NONE!! Based on those 2 things alone- I'll choose to dije elsewhere next time  Honestly I can only imagine the daily round of folks who come in & request a change to something or ask for an additional condiment, only to be shut down!! Basically you get what's on the menu, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS...",3 star rating,Jennifer C.
4/19/2021,"San Luis Obispo, CA","Very disappointed. I recently moved to the area and have heard wonderful thinks about this restaurant.  Came here with my boyfriend for bite to eat assuming it would be a good time since it's a Monday and most tourist have left the area.  The restaurant was a little over half full.  We were promptly seated at the third table on the left of the patio.  Unfortunately, we were unable to try the food because we finally walked out after nearly 20 minutes because we recieved no service. We were never acknowledged by anyone other than the host (who was very friendly) asking if he could take the extra chair and given two waters by a buser; despite the fact that two waitresses and at least two busers contacted the tables around us who were already eating multiple times. It was so bad we started counting how many times any staff walked by us without looking over (at least 10).  Each waitress passed us at least 3 times each. Finally one made eye contact as she passed, yet still did not come back or let us know she would be right with us. I  would understand if they were short staffed, which they were not, but feel it is totally unacceptable to feel completely ignored.",1 star rating,Charmaine F.
10/8/2019,"San Diego, CA","Located in the heart of Solvang. The Succulent Cafe serves up some good 'ol comfort food with a gourmet twist. They also source their seasonal organic ingredients from local farms to give their customers a taste of their freshest delicacies.My family and I had the opportunity to stop by this cozy, small and rustic cafe while in town. It was after 5PM on a weekend and we were just in time for dinner. We sat right outside on the patio, which had a peaceful setting, overlooking a neighboring signature windmill. Not to mention, the cafe is dog friendly and were very accommodating to our furry family member. Our server was also very friendly and attentive to our needs.To start our experience, we ordered our drinks and began with a few appetizers... The Parmesan Truffle Fries and Bacon Wrapped Diver Scallops. All of which were pretty tasty and made to order. At the time, I had their Spicy Hen which is bacon wrapped Jidori chicken breast stuffed with sundried tomato spinach chevre, fresh mozarella, creamy chipotle sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. It was definitely gourmet status and if you have a palette for fine dishes, you'll appreciate the flavors in this dish which paired well with a glass of wine by the way. Everyone's dish was pretty good if you ask me. Overall, our experience was great. The food was flavorful and the staff were certainly pleasant. I would definitely come back when visiting Solvang again.",4 star rating,Jen R.

11/9/2020,"Warren, NJ","I know there are so many brunch places to choose from but I ended up going to Succulent Cafe because of the vegan options they had (my friend is vegan). I came on a Sunday morning around 10am and there was a line (but there were lines at every brunch spot). It took about 20 minutes for 4 of us to be seated. I was in between the Succulent Biscuit and the fried chicken biscuit and luckily my friend was willing to split with me so I was able to taste test both. Both were super delicious but after trying both, if I had to choose one, I would definitely go with the succulent biscuit. The biscuits in both were SO crispy and buttery and I wanted to order several biscuits on its own. The succulent biscuit was definitely the winner though because of the flavor- it was the perfect mix of savory (gravy, pulled pork) and sweet (pineapple chutney). The fried chicken biscuit although tasty (with a tiny kick of spice) is a dish you can easily find anywhere. My friend also definitely recommended the chili for vegans- she thoroughly enjoyed it!",5 star rating,Helen K.
10/6/2019,"Lakewood, CA","3.5 StarsCute spot with indoor and outdoor seating, to accommodate those traveling with pets. After reading reviews, I expected a full service restaurant. However, after the friendly greeting, we were told to go inside order our food and grab a table. Carry your own drinks and utensils to the table and head back up to the cashier for any refills or condiments. Ordered a variety of sandwiches along with the burger. Sandwiches/burger comes with fries, garden salad or fruit. Burger is topped with bacon, cheese, tomatoes  and onions, and is cooked to order. We omitted the cheese and loved the bacon. The burger itself was under seasoned and we welcomed the added condiments. Garden salad was the added side and was just ok. It comes with a vinaigrette, but we opted for ranch on the side. Spicy Chicken Sandwich was delicious and the fries crispy and yummy. The sandwich is topped with blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing, tomatoes, and lettuce. The lettuce on the sandwich was sad looking, just like the piece on the burger. Pastrami sandwich was a bit of a mess. Filled with pastrami topped with cheese on rye bread. Pastrami was plentiful and again good, but not great. Finally, the pulled pork sandwich was enjoyed. It was the only sandwich that I didn't taste. Overall, pleasant outdoor seating and friendly service. Food was a bit on the heavy side and good for a one time try. For the price, it would have been nice to have table service.",3 star rating,Yvette M.
10/28/2020,"Venice, CA","Disappointedly visit for a place we have previously enjoyed. Bad service starting with the hostess who said our table for 7 would be ready in 20 minute. 45 minute later standing in the sun our table emptied but staff had no urgency to clean. We finally went to them and offer to wipe down the table ourselves. Service was slow....at one point we walked to the bar to pickup our drinks ourselves since it was just sitting there. Worst of all, staff imposed the 20% tip even though menu says parties of 8 or more and we were 7. By all rights we could have challenged this but I think staff knew they failed and didn't care about repeat business. Good place to know but if it is crowded, be warned.",2 star rating,Franklin K.

9/10/2019,"North Hollywood, CA","Stopped in for dinner thanks to a recommendation from a local who did not steer us wrong! It was pretty busy Saturday night but was able to score a last minute reservation. My dude and I had some pretty tasty eats: the bacon wrapped diver scallops, chimichurri white tiger shrimp, and the Cattleman's Cut steak, along with Bloody Marys. The bacon wrapped scallops were absolutely delicious -- I could eat 5 more plates of that, ha! The shrimp sat on a bed of grits with peppers and chimichurri over it, which is probably one of the tastiest things I put in my mouth. The steak was perfectly cooked and was the perfect amount to split. The Bloody Marys had quite the kick to them, and were garnished with two very thick slices of meaty bacon, aka perfection. Parking was pretty easy especially later in the evening. The name of the place kind of threw me off at first (insert thoughts of granola and health food) but I'm glad I was pointed in this direction. Will definitely come back if I'm back in the area!",5 star rating,Patricia G.

1/31/2020,"Tempe, AZ","Had lunch here with my 8 year old grandson. My spicy chicken salad with cornbread croutons was OK (nothing special), but my grandson's peanut butter and jelly sandwich was not edible. He said there was something wrong with the strawberry jelly and that the pasta side salad was way too spicy. This was on the kids menu and many small children do not do well with strong flavors. We found out that the jelly was a cranberry/strawberry jelly so that explains the bitter taste my grandson was detecting.The staff was terrific and brought a fruit salad to replace the overly spicy pasta salad for my grandson. They also freshly prepared a to-go order just before we left to take back to our room for my daughter. I probably would not make a special effort to re-visit this establishment and do not recommend it for kids.",3 star rating,Sue C.

Friday we had no problem and decided to go back on Saturday,  but the hostess claimed she could only have 5 parties on the wait list so we would have to just come back later and try again. Since there was no telling if we would have better luck later on, we didn't come back. Only allowing 5 on the list at a time was really disappointing since they don't even take Reservations.",5 star rating,Joe J.
9/21/2020,"San Bruno, CA","This place should be 4.5, .5 knocked off for service. They are friendly, but not as fast or attentive. This may be due to the long lines they have for Sunday brunch. It was a 30 min wait and we were sat accordingly. The guys got the Shortrib Hash 'n Eggs, I got the Succulent Biscuit, and our other friend got the Breakfast Platter. My friend got a grapefruit mimosa and i got the Mandarin Smash (? I forget). My drink was so refreshing and tasted like summer. We all enjoyed our food, and though my portion looked small, it was so delicious. Kinda reminded me of al pastor meat- it's even better if you add Cholula (provided on your table). The gravy and the cholula and the juices from the meat and pineapple were so good I ordered another biscuit to soak it up. The biscuit came with delicious jam and butter and is probably one of the best biscuits I've ever had- soft, buttery, with a nice texture. Solvang Elementary School is a block behind the restaurant, and they offer free public parking on weekends (no overnight parking)- such a great system! Definitely recommend this place!

7/1/2019,"Glendale, CA","Decided to try this place on our visit to Solvang. It's one of the higher rated cafes and wine bars in the heart of solvang.That being said be prepared to wait. It's an order at the counter and take a number and go to find a seat place. Depending on the time of day and what day, you may have trouble finding a seat. Have someone from your party stand watch while you order.Basic selection of mid grade wines. Variety is great and prices are average. Average for a nice sit down spot, not so much for a cafe style. More on the pricy side.We enjoyed a couple glasses of cab and the charcuterie plate. All together around 60 for all 3.Charcuterie plate was around $45 and I give it a firm 4/5. Selection was good but for the price it was just ok serving wise. It easily feeds 2-3.

The decor outside and throughout the outdoor dining area certainly matched the restaurants name. Beautiful, huge succulent arrangements everywhere.We were greeted by the hostess and seating rather immediately. Wait staff was friendly and very attentive. Drinks were served almost as quickly as we were seated. While we glanced over the menu we were served with delicious bite sized biscuits and jam. Every item on the menu looked fabulous but we went with the Succulent Bacon Burger with fries and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. One of the best burgers I've had away from home. Seriously! I'm still thinking about it. Ugh..so yummy! The patty was cooked perfectly medium well, not dry, super juicy, GREAT flavor. The brioche bun was fresh and didn't fall apart The applewood smoked bacon, and I freaking LOVE bacon, was thick, crispy, and added the right amount of smokiness to the burger. The brussel sprouts were a hit also. The fig balsamic reduction the sprouts were dressed in added a really fresh undertone...and yes there was bacon in that too (insert heart emoji).Trying to figure out the next I can make the drive from LA back to Solvang for that burger and a visit to a local brewery.",5 star rating,Miori I.
6/5/2019,"La Puente, CA","By the time we arrived at Solvang most of the other stores were already closed.  We saw that this place was highly recommended so we decided to try it out.  When we arrived all the tables were occupied so we put our name on a waitlist.  We only waited maybe about 10 minutes for our table to be available, so I recommend reserving a table if you plan on coming here.  I ordered the Grilled Duck Breast ($29), and then the table ordered a 2 Cheese/2 Meat Charcuterie Board to share ($23).  We also received a complimentary basket of biscuits with jam.  Those were delicious.  The biscuits were super buttery flaky, but not so flaky that it fell apart.  So honestly I don't remember exactly what kinds of meats and cheese that we got on our charcuterie board, but I do remember that both of the meats were pork and the board was also decorated with craisins, raisins, sundried tomatoes, dried apricots, olives, and pickled vegetables.  You also get a small cup of mustard and jam and a basket of crostinis.  No matter what combination you make with everything on the board, it all tasted amazing.  Personally I wish that instead of the crostinis we got softer bread, but that's really only so that it's safer to eat with my braces.  The grilled duck breast was a good choice for me.  It wasn't too heavy, especially after eating the bisuits and charcuterie since I was starting to get full already after eating those two.  I was still able to finish most of the plate.  You can taste the orange gastrique throughout the whole thing, and it really complimented the forbidden rice.  Service was great, everyone was really friendly and gave us some really good recommendations.  They kept our water cups constantly filled and answered any questions about the menu that we had.  This place is a little bit pricey but if you want to eat at a nice restaurant then I recommend coming here if you're in Solvang.",4 star rating,Jenny T.

The weather was hot but under the umbrella was totally nice and cool. The waitress noticed our dog and brought a water bowl for him. The food came out right away and the service was great. They didn't check our temperature or asked us to sanitize which is why I deducted a star. We ordered meatloaf sandwich, BLTA (with Avocado), chicken Caesar Salad, and Spicy Chicken sandwich.

They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches and a nice selection for breakfast too. They even have a dog menu. I had the 1/2 tuna salad with garden salad and my hubby had the house roasted turkey sandwich with fries. Both sandwiches were excellent! Both stuffed with lots of meat and goodness.

4/26/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","I was on a road trip from LA to Central California and I stopped by here along the way for brunch! My review is as follows:Food: I opted for the Eggs Benedict and it was really good. The egg was poached just right and had a perfect runny texture, while the English muffin was toasted impeccably! Each order came with a side of potatoes and you can request to add either bacon, ham or sausage for an additional cost of around $3. I recommend the bacon! I honestly still think about this meal because it was so good lol. I savored every single bite tbh. I paired this meal with OJ and it was a match made in heaven.Price: Kind of expensive but you pay for the ambiance and presentation. I didn't leave super full even though I paid $17 but it was good for what it was. My friends got similar meals and all paid $15+Service: Everyone was nice! You walk up to the cashier, order, they give you a number and then they bring it to your table. Water is served by the cashier and condiments are reading available at your table. Not really any waiter/waitress service. You just eat and leave!Location: Super convenient and located right in the middle of the street you take to drive through downtown Solvang. It was very easy to locate and there was parking on the side streets. As you would expect for a cafe named ""Succulent cafe"", there were assortments of succulents displayed outside the cafe, which I thought was a nice touch!",5 star rating,Jonathan D.

We were given a menu and table by the window right away. Devon was our server and she recited the specials for that busy night. We picked 2 items for dinner: short rib and martino flatbread. We thoroughly enjoyed the comp biscuits and jam. Loved my short rib- meat was tender, grits was so tasty. Husband had Riesling and I had the house Pinot Grigio.  The flatbread was just ok- nothing to rave about. I like that it's thin crust and had a generous amount of meats.  The atmosphere, ambience of the restaurant was relaxed. Devon was a good server and we liked her recommendations. The bussers were also efficient in refilling water and taking out extra/ used plates. Food didn't come out quick but we were enjoying our wine and biscuits and the atmosphere anyway so it was no issue for us. I'm glad we picked this restaurant on our night in Solvang.

We needed refills and even put the cups and end of table and nothing. She must of passed by our table 10x and nothing. She served everyone else and got them drinks and everything. The sad thing was we had my 11 year old daughter with us asking what's going on. I told her something in life your going to experience racism because of how you look or color of your skin.

12/23/2018,"San Luis Obispo, CA","This charcuterie looked inviting and was recommended by our concerige. As it was early in the dinner hour, we weren't sure we'd get a table without a reservation. The hostess was congenial and said she had a table that was open for 1 1/2 hours.  The wait staff was prompt, efficient, and friendly. The wine selections were numerous and nicely presented along walls throughout the restaurant. The meal was good however the portions were quite small.The Penne Pasta with Vodka Cream Sauce was more of a red marinara sauce. It wasn't creamy and the color wrong, perhaps they had to substitute the sauce? The pasta was perfectly al dente.The Sea Bass special included a nice portion of fish, was pan seared with a cream sauce atop the fish. The sauce would have been better tasting with much less salt. It was served with a small portion of steamed broccoli & rice pilaf. The broccoli was perfectly blanched, but the rice pilaf was also over salted.  Please tone down on the salt as it takes away from the natural flavors and seasonings!We still enjoyed our dinner, but might select another eatery next time.",4 star rating,Terry C.

9/21/2020,"Santa Monica, CA","My boyfriend and I were gonna go to Paula's for their pancakes but the wait was 30mins long and we were both really hungry driving from SB that morning. We found SUCCULENT CAFE next door with a 15min wait and glad we ate here instead because WOW. AMAZING FRENCH TOAST!!! Probably the best I've ever had and I love French toast! My boyfriend got the short rib hash and eggs and we loved that too! The meat was very tender and goes perfectly well with the house potatoes!! If you're in SOLVANG, stop by SUCCULENT CAFE! You will not regret it!! Quality food at a decent price! And if there's a waiting time, please wait! It is totally worth it!!! And the host was amazing with great attitude considering she was dealing with some impatient and hangry folks! Kudos to the host with blonde hair! We were there Sunday at 2pm. Will definitely be back here when we visit Solvang again. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu! FIVE STARS!!!!!",5 star rating,Nadine R.

We wanted to order something to-go cuz we wanna avoid the crowd and any possibility to catch COVID. We waited for 10+ minute at the takeout counter but no one showed up to get our order. After we finally placed an order, nobody seemed to remember there was an open order for us. Clueless people jeez...",2 star rating,Eric Z.
8/26/2019,"San Jose, CA","This place is underrated. My BF and I stopped over in Solvang on our way to LA for a wedding. We were looking for a yummy place for breakfast and of course all of the top rated places are major tourist traps. The town is precious and of course you want to embrace your visit! BUT pancakes are pancake! The Succulent Cafe is reasonably priced, adorable establishment with delicious food! We sat outside in the succulent garden and enjoyed the sunshine as we waited for our food. I had the biscuits and gravy... top notch! The gravy was CLEARLY made with REAL ingredients! My bf got the short ribs eggs and hash (I think). I had a few bite of the meat and that s*^% was killer! If you're still craving some pastries after your breakfast then go stop and a pastry shop and indulge in an overly priced sugar treat you're on vacation you deserve it! Cheers to the succulent cafe!",5 star rating,Phoenix B.
10/25/2020,"San Jose, CA",Ended up eating here and was impressed NOT only by the service but also the food was outstanding. My friend got the French toast and it was AMAZING!

9/20/2020,"Los Angeles, CA",We went here on a chilly evening. Sat outside due to COVID. We asked them to turn the heater that was placed 2 ft away from us on. The guys moved the heater 8 ft away and turn it on. Our waiter kept  arguing the heater needs to be away from the umbrella. So why don't you move the umbrella or just close it? It's too much work!!!! We and the kids ended up sitting in the cold. Hope they don't get sick.,2 star rating,Lucky O.
9/20/2018,"Paradise Valley, AZ","First time in Solvang. After my friend and I went wine tasting, we were in need of lunch time food. We're both not a breakfast pancake type of people. I wanted to snack on an Artisan Charcuterie and Cheese Board and have an ice cold beer... and I FOUND it, at the Succulent Cafe. It wasn't real busy when we arrived. I didn't know the seating protocol so we sat down and waited and waited, until a gentleman told us the lay of the land. You go to the deli part of the building, order and then they deliver to your table.We ordered the 3+3 Artisan Charcuterie and Farmstead Cheeses (3 meats and 3 cheese). The board also has Olives, Nuts, Pickled Veggies and Crostini along with mustard and jam. My only comment was that they should tell you the meat and cheese selection you will be getting on your board. Absolutely FANTASTIC! Hit the spot.Atmosphere: Very nice, earthy, nice patio, Service: good, Food: very good",4 star rating,Melody K.

7/22/2019,"Pasadena, CA","You see the reviews. You see happy people. Who doesn't love biscuits for breakfast right? There is a pig theme everywhere. A flying pig right above where you order. What could go wrong? Not a thing.The take pride in their food. They just won some award they told me. It was hard to concentrate with all that lovely smell just beckoning while I ordered. I started go with the Succulent Biscuit. The person asked me if I was okay with 'some heat.' Um, no. Thanks for putting that out there. Went with Meatloaf biscuit (don't judge - it's not your grandma's meatloaf), spouse got Bourbon Vanilla french toast. I did not know you could prepare French toast like that. My amazing meatloaf suddenly felt less than. But honestly, everything was so good here. You order and then find a table. Prepare yourself for some fancy footwork to get a preferred location, but it never got so crowded nobody could find a place. Go here. The guy at the local bicycle shop told me the locals love this place.",5 star rating,Edward B.
9/15/2019,"Woodland Hills, CA","A very cute little cafe. I stopped here with my family because when we asked one of the workers at the nearby ostrich farm what was good in Solvang, her immediate response was Succulent Cafe. When we got here, the place was bustling and busy, but a server that spotted us walk in immediately took the time to direct us towards the front. While I'm on that, the service was so fantastic! Very kind and attentive.I ordered the Spicy Fried Chicken sandwich and it was good, though I think I should've ordered something else. The bread wasn't toasted or anything of the sort, and since it was thick, the sandwich tasted dry overall. The ratio of chicken to the rest of the insides was a little off, and the blue cheese wasn't spread very evenly throughout. Overall, it was a good sandwich, but nothing too special and nothing I'd order again in the future. But the fries were so good! The rest of my family kept stealing them off my plate, saying they were delicious. My sister ordered one of the breakfast platters (I can't recall the name) and she loved it. My mom also loved her Cobb Salad, as she kept trying to get everyone to taste it and how fresh and well prepared it was.Overall, everyone was pretty happy with their food and the great service!",4 star rating,Emilie C.
1/12/2020,"Plano, TX","This was my second time visiting Solvang from LA, and I had to come back here due to excellent service and even more excellent meals. Last time I got their famous charcuterie and cheese board (you can choose how many meats and/or cheeses you want). Delicious! This time my group started off with red pimiento cheese dip, and it was phenomenal! Very addicting! Then for my main meal I had their fried chicken biscuit with gravy. Beware: it's a very heavy meal, but oh so good. The rest of my table ordered a bacon cheeseburger, which was perfectly cooked. And also the BLTA was fire! You can't go wrong eating here. Staff is super welcoming and friendly. There's also a free outdoor public parking lot directly across the street. You can sit inside or outside, and pets are welcome if you sit outside.",5 star rating,Bella L.

7/6/2019,"Paso Robles, CA",A nice cafe in the heart of Solvang.  Dog friendly patio dining with water filled dog bowls.  Counter order and food will be delivered to your table. This is grab your own seating so if you see an outdoor table snag it if you have a  pooch along.   I had the spicy fried chicken salad and it was good.  Greens with seeds and cornbread croutons ( the best part).   Friends had the pulled pork with fries.  A turkey sandwich with salad and a curry chicken salad all which was reported as good.  Outdoor dining is the best part.,4 star rating,Evelyn R.
6/29/2019,"San Jose, CA","A well-deserved and rare 5 star rating from me! Visited Solvang for the first time and Succulent Cafe was definitely worth our while!  We sat at a table outside and it was a bit chilly and breezy even though there was still plenty of daylight for an early evening dinner. Thankfully, they provided a heating lamp and some great menu choices!3 FARMSTEAD CHEESES: I confess that I don't remember the names of the cheeses but feel free to view the photo. :)  The mix of the cheeses and jam, dried cranberries, nuts, olives, and crostini were a delightful appetizer and had our party clamoring for more.CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS: The brussels sprouts were crispy from the broiling and were sweetened with Applewood smoked bacon, sprinkled with parmesan and fig balsamic.  Brussels sprouts can be quite bitter when not cooked prepared properly but these brussels sprouts were as tasty as french fries.ROASTED BEET SALAD: Hey, if presentation means anything then the presentation on this salad is quite inviting. Such a delicious plate of mixed greens, beet coulis, toasted hazelnuts, Humboldt fog, and red wine vinagrette! The Humboldt fog cheese looks fancy, but not quite my preference in cheeses as it tasted too rich for me.BUTTERMILK MARINATED FRIED CHICKEN: Yeah, went to a fancy restaurant to order the fried chicken I've been craving. Lol. However, this fried chicken was well cooked with a wonderfully tasteful crispy skin and moist breast meat. The mac 'n cheese was absolutely outstanding!! Simply, it may have been some of the best mac n' cheese I've ever tasted. The southern style stewed collard greens was bitter as collard greens usually are, but it was soft and thoroughly cooked. PENNE PASTA WITH SHRIMP: The homemade tomato vodka cream sauce and added shrimp was quite phenomenal. The penne pasta was fairly al dente when initially served. The shredded parmesan cheese added the final touch to an incredibly delicious dish! RHONE BLEND: The Highland Oaks ""16 Crows Cuvee"" Rhone Blend was an excellent choice! It was a full bodied and fragrant red wine that was not acidic and went well with our meal. The food was excellent all around! At many fine restaurants, we often have dishes that stand out and other dishes that are subpar. Not At Succulent Cafe! All dishes were outstanding which is a hard feat to accomplish!!",5 star rating,Spencer Y.

2/20/2021,"City of Industry, CA","My first experience here and will never go back . Hostess made it a point to let us know that it's about a 35 min wait , that if we leave they won't seat us , if they call our name and we're not here they won't text or call. This is all understandable but it really just seemed she did not want us at this restaurant. I asked to be put on list and asked for menu and she gave me one . Then 10 min later we were called and seated . Waitress took our order and never came back ! She went to every single table next to us and asked if they were ok ? When she finally came after we stacked all our plates and cups to get attention ,there was no apology just the check. I own my own business and have been in customer service for  over 20 years .

12/28/2019,"Arroyo Grande, CA","This has been our go to spot the last few times we've come through here. It's usually amazing and the food has consistently been on point. This time around we ordered a burger, a pastrami sandwich, a blta & a biscuit with a side of fruit. The fruit, burger & pastrami sandwich (the meat is made in house) were delicious! The blta was lacking flavor; there was barely any bacon on it and it just tasted like bread with avocado (not a horrible thing, but not what I was expecting). The biscuit too was flavorless. The texture was spot on, but it literally tasting like nothing. It was bizarre and disappointing. Butter & jam helped a bit, but not enough to make the biscuit worthwhile. I'm still giving 4 stars because the rest of the food was good and on all previous occasions, everything has been delicious. I hope this was just a fluke.",4 star rating,Ani P.

In the middle of a pandemic, you would think people would be grateful for a job but it seems your staff aren't the case. The waitresses and hostess couldn't have had more of an attitude and honestly the only person working at your restaurant that seemed nice was the buzz cut hair gal working behind the bar.

12/31/2019,"Santa Maria, CA","The 2 stars are only for the food, if I could give 0 stars for the service I would.I ordered the fried chicken and biscuit plate. It was delicious! I'm not usually a fan of something smothered in gravy but the gravy was perfect. Not too salty, a little savory, and not at all watery. And the chicken was spicy but not too spicy!I ordered my food at 12:37 pm. It was but people were getting their food. I was with my friend so I didn't notice the time. However, I noticed that the people who were in line in front of me were leaving already. I checked the time and it was 1:20. I hadn't received my food or a check in from any of the workers as to the status of it. The only person to say something was the bus boy who stopped by and told me it was coming out soon. So shout out to you bus boy, thank you for being the only person in the establishment to tell me anything. I highly recommend coming here: you can bring your dog, eat great food, and sit in the very middle of Solvang. However, I and my friend personally would not be coming back. I don't want to risk receiving such bad service.",2 star rating,Erin E.
12/22/2019,"Santa Ynez, CA","Succulent Cafe is a great place to dine. I like the vibe and energy of this place. They have very few choices for vegetarians though which makes it a bit difficult to navigate the menu. I've brought many people here several times and they have all enjoyed it. The only reason I gave them a 3 is because they have a beautiful outdoor garden area which attracts a lot of bees, naturally. I love the garden BUT they have traps and kill the bees. I've spoken to the manager who mentioned to me that they were going to stop killing the bees. I returned a short time later and still the traps were there. When I approached the manager a second time he said the traps only kill non pollinating bees and was quite dismissive to me. Until they stop killing the bees (of any kind) I will not return or recommend to others.",3 star rating,Paul R.

It will take approximately 30 minutes to get your food after you order. 3/5 Curried chicken saladWhile the curried chicken was delicious, the salad was just a handful of mixed greens, not enough to balance out the powerful flavors of the curried chicken. I don't think this was worth the amount paid for.3/5 Short ribs and hashThere was maybe a scoop of short ribs, hidden under a layer of cold melted cheese. Most of the dish were potatoes. The potatoes didn't taste bad at all however if you're putting short ribs as the dish name, I'm expecting more than a tiny scoop.Overall, it's okay but there are probably better options around here.",2 star rating,Elli L.

This spot was cute, off a main road, and we walked in to be greeted by super friendly and knowledgable staff. It is a walk up and order, but be served at your table kind of joint. There was lots of pork/bacon inspired dishes, which alone is enough to make me happy!I had some biscuits and gravy that were everything I could have dreamed of that morning. So good. Very heavy but delicious. My boyfriend also enjoyed his meal very much. We liked that there was indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a fantastic playlist on the loudspeaker. Only thing we hated is the paper straws. Straw alternatives dont bug me in and of themselves, but paper straws always disintegrate and leave a weird texture in my mouth I hate.

5/31/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",Found this gem while every other place was an hour wait. They're known for their cheese boards here and the biscuits! Service could have been faster as you order at the counter and our host was super friendly and gave everyone extra customized attention instead of just ringing up orders but there was def a wait. The succulent biscuit was phenomenal. Great taste of spice and sweet and the gravy meshed it's creaminess so well with the spice and sweet it was glorious. I can justify paying $13 for this. The biscuits are also AMAZING here as they were flaky but kind of chewy. Kind of like if a biscuit and English muffin combined with chewy ness and I loved it! Potatoes weren't bad as they had bell peppers. Next time will def try the cheese plates as that looked amazing!The outdoor area is really cute for a people watching in Solvang!,4 star rating,Casie N.
8/12/2019,"Huntington Beach, CA","Decided to stop by here for lunch on our road trip. What a great decision it was! Everyone was friendly and we ordered food before grabbing a seat. They give you a number, forks, and napkins in a mason jar so they can find you later to bring your food to your chosen table. Definitely fits with the rustic theme of the restaurant. Tip: ask a server for a knife if you need one.We got the eggs Benedict and short ribs hash. The salmon eggs Benedict wasn't the best I've had but the short ribs hash was amazing. The cheese complemented the juices from the meat and the potatoes were so sweet and soft. Definitely a great place to have a later brunch.",4 star rating,Cindy D.
9/12/2020,"Riverside, CA","This spot is so cute. Lots of outside seating. Very clean and sanitized. We came by at night and the patio was magical. Our server was awesome. She maintained a safe distance and was very helpful with everything.My husband is vegitarian and I am vegan so we picked this place because of the many reviews of their vegan friendly menu. It was a little disappointing when we got there to find that it was only a beyond burger (I can't stand the flavor of them) and chili. I got the chili, the $20 yes $20 dollar chili....My husband got the burger which was $18. He said it was one of the best beyond burgers he's had, the bread was amazing and it had an avocado spread that looked good too. I tried his fries because the $20 chili came out and it was a tiny bowl of what I can only describe as corn salsa, and his fries were good too.I make chili often at home thats 10 times closer to chili then this was. Anyhow it was good but it was salsa, for $20. Completely over priced for what it was, and it didn't even come with bread or anything, just a bowl of black beans, corn, giant chunks of onion (beware, I LOVE onion, so this was pleasing to me), what looked like canned roasted tomatoes, and a couple chunks of potato....so salsa with potato.If you eat regular food I bet this place would be well worth the price. It just wasn't for the vegan options. There are a lot of places in town that serve the beyond burger tho at a cheaper price.We had cocktails and beer also. The negroni was delicious. My husband got pie. Mostly because I asked to see a desert menu because I had read they had vegan dessert and I was still hungry after my bowl of salsa. They did not have vegan dessert and my husband felt bad we asked for a menu and didn't want to not order anything, or so he said, haha. He got the dessert special, which was a silk chocolate pie with whipped cream. He said it was really good. It looked amazing, I was very jealous.Overall I would come here again for cocktails but not to eat.",4 star rating,Shaina W.

3/23/2019,"Bakersfield, CA","Aw man Succulent Cafe, I really wanted to like you. I really did, but I have to be honest. I was disappointed. It was 5:40pm when we walked in. We were told it was still Happy Hour and couldn't order off the dinner menu yet. We said it was fine, maybe we start off with Happy Hour menu for appetizers and could we move onto dinner at the appropriate time. It was just disappointing that by the time our server came around to us, got us something to drink, took our Happy Hour order; the kitchen was open. We order dinner and ask if I can substitute the mashed potatoes and veggies that come with my steak for the brussel sprouts that are on the appetizer dinner menu. The server tells me no. Okay I get it, but it just rubbed me the wrong way because she never offered the full dinner menu when we walked in. If I knew the brussel sprouts were on there, I would've never ordered the boring iceberg salad to kill Happy Hour time. The server wasn't rude, just not the best. I just think we could've been informed a little better, shouldn't have to ask for utensils, or a refill on water at the caliber of what Succulent Cafe sets itself up to be. The food was okay when it finally came out. Nothing to write home about. The vibe is cool and everything is set up nice. Cute indoor and outdoor seating.",3 star rating,Sarah A.

Food was amazing (we loved the biscuit and short ribs). Service was so friendly and all servers were masks, gloves and there was sanitizer on all the tables.

8/10/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Could have better service, but the food is 100 times better than Paula's next door. A bit pricier, but if you are someone who knows quality, go here for a Solvang breakfast to remember. I have admittedly only had 3 things on the menu (2 eggs Benedict variations and French toast), but they were amazing. But if you're a simpleton who likes crowds and cheap thin pancakes, go to Paula's, they'll hook you and your 5 whining piglets up.",4 star rating,Zach M.

11/23/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","My friend and I went in for a couple snacks and a glass of wine on a friday evening. We sat at the bar and were attended to fairly quickly. It wasn't a very busy night so our food order came quickly as well. The brussel sprouts were a little undercooked and we ordered the artichoke dip which was served chilled ( like right out of the fridge).  We mentioned to the bartender that the dip was strange because it was so cold and it would probably be better served warm or at least room temperature, she responded that vegetarians seem to like it. Hmm. Ok. I wasn't impressed being that we only ordered appetizers and neither of them were very good. I used to order a smoked onion dip from their menu, but I was told they eliminated it because it wasn't popular so I don't see much of a reason to go back.",3 star rating,Kristy O.

The to-go window felt safe and socially distanced.  The first night we got the meatloaf and the 2nd the salmon!  Meatloaf for the win!  The mac-n-cheese appetizer was amazing!  It was just a 2 minute walk from our hotel.  We'd eat their every night, trying new entrees if we stayed longer!  Highly recommend!  Service was really good, too!",5 star rating,Michele F.
12/10/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","We've been to Succulent Cafe for brunch twice now and have loved it both times!! The food is excellent so of course there is sometimes a wait, but both times it's been entirely worth it. They have a great outdoor patio but also a large dining room with a wine bar. The brunch portions appear to be small but we've never left hungry and, in fact, have always left with a to-go box! This most recent trip my husband ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon which were amazing. The salmon was definitely worth paying a little extra. I ordered the fried chicken and gravy biscuit for an incredibly hearty breakfast. I got a side of breakfast potatoes to go with it. The potatoes were big chunks which I usually don't like since they're typically undercooked, but these potatoes were perfectly cooked!! It went extremely well with my petrov Bacon Bloody Mary!! Our friend, seeing the smaller plates coming out of the kitchen, decided to order TWO entrees, the French toast AND the Short Rib Hash with Eggs. When his plates came not only were they larger plates but they both tasted delicious!! The Short Rib Hash was by far the biggest breakfast dish they serve and easily the most delicious! The short ribs were cooked in cinnamon and cumin, I think. It was amazing combo. We also got to use our Santa Barbara Axxess card for buy one, get one free on our entrees!",5 star rating,Abbey F.

2/14/2018,"Pismo Beach, CA","We came down to Solvang for Valentine's Day. We yelped places for lunch and the Succulent Cafe came up as number 1. We walked in. There were beautiful succulents everywhere (hence the name).  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and they bring you the food out to your table. The guy that took our order was very friendly and helpful. They had a great menu for cheese boards but we decided to save that for another time. My SO ordered the curry chicken salad sandwich with French fries and I ordered the fried chicken salad. We took our number (which was a utensil and napkin holder) and found a table outside. The weather was perfect. After 10-15 mins here comes our food. The curry chicken salad sandwich looked amazing and my fried chicken salad looked more like curry chicken. I ask the waitress if this was the fried chicken and she said no. They had made a mistake. She apologized and corrected it and about another 10 mins I got my friend chicken salad. It was really good!  I'm from the South so I know what fried chicken is suppose to taste like. The sandwich my SO got was also good but he said it was a little on the sweet side (it had raisins and apples in it) and the fries were good but a little soggy.  We're debating on giving this place a 3 or 4 star review. We agree it was probably a 3 1/2. The ambiance is great and the food mostly good. It's a little pricey for the quality, but still good enough that we would go back.",3 star rating,Jennifer B.

9/7/2017,"Riverside, CA","On our trip through Solvang on Labor Day we decided to stop by and get breakfast. As most new people in town we turned to Yelp for help us find some good eats. We decided to go to Paula's Pancake House and was told by the staff at the podium that that the wait time would be a 30 - 40 minute for the two counter seats. Looking at the seats filled with guest at the patio and the number of people waiting outside it sounded about right. So I ask my girlfriend if she wanted to check out the Succulent Cafe we passed by on the way to Paula's Pancake House. She said sure, so we went on our way to check it out while we wait. We walked back passing a few shops and stopped at the Succulent Cafe Wine Charcuterie. The line here wasn't long only a few guest in line. Good thing we came to check it out early, soon after we got our food, the line for the cafe extended past the patio. Most of the guest were already seated and eating egg benedict or some other egg dishes. After looking through the menu we settled on getting the spicy fried chicken sandwich ($14) with a petite  green salad drizzled with red wine vinaigrette.We sat at the window counter, which caused  the server some issues locating our number since he walked around a few times outside and through the separate dinning room at the side of the patio area, but he eventually found us. As the food arrived, we were ready to eat, after we took a few snap shots for Yelp we dug right in. The chicken was crispy and juicy with just enough spicy kick in the sauce. The salad with the dressing was delicious as well with a creamy and sweet taste. Next time we come back will try something new.",4 star rating,Sam W.

The floor plan was very spacious for social distancing.However, the Male bar tender (specifically during the afternoon of 6/27/20) was not wearing his mask during our entire time there. This made us feel extremely uncomfortable to buy any drinks (we went from wanting to order 6 mimosas to none). We noticed our waitress speak to him which we appreciated but he still didn't. This made us pretty uncomfortable because if he wasn't out in the open floor we were concerned that the cooks might not either.

Dog friendly patio.   You order in line then grab your seat but it was New Year's Day and it was busy so we saved a table then one of us got in line to order. Line took about 10 min to reach the front. You could see all the food coming out of the window. It looked and smelled heavenly.  Order breakfast platter with an iced coffee and the spare rib and poached egg plate. Everything was so good and was a big portion. I had to take it to go. Also got an oj. And it was pretty small for $4. There's servers walking around checking on stuff. I would be back if I'm in town. Only thing I'd say is the bacon was way too done for my taste but still pretty,5 star rating,Jenay B.

This dish alone is worthy of anyone returning to this restaurant. Every ingredient on this delectable dish was impressively fresh and delicious. The hot pastrami sandwich was sensational. The meat was tender, not over cooked and the flavors were bursting. It wasn't anywhere near too salty either. The bread on which it was served was soft. I got sweet potato fries on the side which were fried just right (not over cooked). Of course, my kids loved them too and grabbed and ate all of mine before I could eat a handful of em; kids love these fries and so will you adults. Employees are all courteous and knowledgeable about their menu. This restaurant is immaculate inside the dining room and so are the bathrooms. They serve water for pets.

With so many places to eat it was hard to choose from but I decided to go to Succulent for their menu and great reviews. The food was ok. Nothing superb. I had the stuffed hen, it was good but nothing I would come back for and definitely not $29. My sister had the meat pizza and it was beyond flat, more like a paper thin layer of dough just to have something to throw ingredients on. As far as drinks, they didn't offer flights and knowing they have so many wineries down the road I would've expected a $10 cup of Rose not $15 for less than half a glass. I enjoyed eating outside, nice patio area, small menu but enough for all tastes. The service was great, our waitress checked on us multiple times.",3 star rating,Dahlia Y.

10/12/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","The feedback I'm giving is solely because of a situation I had. I can't eat bacon and I'm very adamant about it. I ordered the fried chicken with the Mac on the side. My food came and the Mac n cheese tasted a lot like bacon, so I did my due diligence before taking another bite and asked whether or not it had bacon. The server assured me there was no bacon. I kept on eating my food, only to find bacon in the Mac n cheese (mind you I have been served bacon before and have been around it enough to know if it's bacon). My server again assured me it couldn't be bacon, and she took the dish back. Then the manager came out to again, assure me it wasn't bacon but it was ""chicken skin"". To be frank, it smelled like bacon and I've seen bacon previous times... enough to know if a dish has it. Considering the entire restaurant is known for bacon, I'm not entirely surprised the Mac n cheese had it. What bothers me the most is how adamant both the server and the manager were considering the dish blatantly had bacon pieces in it. I was not accommodated for the dish or anything further. Thoroughly disappointed because the food otherwise was delicious.",1 star rating,Mahnoor M.

The burger was perfectly cooked. They also have wines available by the glass or the bottle since it's a charcuterie. They have meat and cheese plates to go with your wine. They don't have a full bar, but they do have some signature cocktails on the menu. We tried the basil gimlet and the tropical pig. The basil gimlet was good, refreshing. I wish there was more punch in the tropical pig, it was more of a hard cider. The cashier was friendly and helpful. All around good experience.

11/6/2017,"Long Beach, CA","After a long morning of driving up here, my boyfriend and I stopped by here because I'm a sucker for succulents! Plenty of those out in the patio.I ordered the artisan grilled cheese with bacon and a side of pasta salad, he ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with fries. The winner was definitely the pasta salad, which wasn't even the main entree.. Neither one really impressed the two of us.Grilled cheese had plenty of bacon, tomato, cheese (duh), and super crispy and buttery bread! I loved the bacon, but unfortunately half of them were burnt. The side of pasta salad was surprising at first bite. I wasn't expecting the slight kick with it, but definitely refreshing and something I enjoyed a little too much. The spicy chicken sandwich was good... while we still had the chicken. The bread to chicken ratio was horrible; the chicken was only half the size of the bread, so halfway through, we'd just be having bread with spread. Aside from that, the chicken was seasoned very well and wasn't dry at all. I did wish it had a little more kick since it is a ""spicy"" chicken sandwich. The fries that came with it were super cripsy! :) The outside patio was also great for people watching, but definitely watch out for the bees! There was one that would not leave me alone! :(",3 star rating,Angela T.

9/2/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","It's hard to call anything a ""hidden gem"" on the main drag in Solvang, a tourist village so small you could walk from one side of town to the other in less than an hour. This is a hidden gem.Why? It's more of a big-city menu, with an upscale feel, then you'd expect from a touristy place fashioned like rural Denmark. I had bourbon vanilla French toast for lunch, and the texture (crispy outside, warm and soft inside) and shape (cylindrical) was unlike any French toast I've had. Did I mention bourbon vanilla?Tried the charcuterie because I had to. Not as ambitious as some other menu items, but still satisfying. Feels like the restaurant is still transitioning from campy family style to upscale/urban, but it's almost there. This restaurant wouldn't be out of place in, say, Portland. Every small tourist village should have one of those!",5 star rating,JP H.

The eggs Benedict were probably the worst I've had. The eggs may as well have been advertised as hard boiled, not poached by any manner; Eggs Benedict should be poached and runny! This problem is the chefs fault, because the waitress we had was on top of her game, no complaints there. HOWEVER.....we tried to return in the evening to get drinks a half hour before they closed and were denied service.

We opted for the patio and it was great. Got the spicy fried chicken salad, biscuit+jam side, 3 cheeses board, and the pastrami sandwich+fries. The fries are delicious - crispy, lengthy, amazing. The fried chicken was great warm and moist on the inside, crunchy and flavorful on the outside. The chicken itself seems marinated in spicy marinade prior to being breaded and fried which makes the heat embedded and still light. Loved this place and would definitely go back again!

It wasn't terrible but for the price I was paying for each plate it was very disappointing. I almost wanted to just return the plates because I was so dissatisfied with how ""watered down"" everything tasted. The drinks were good here so I'd recommend this place if your just looking at hanging out at the bar for drinks but would not recommend their food.

Still, they had a very pleasant selection of beers for whatever your preference might be. I ordered the beet salad and my bf got the Three Little Pigs.

Sooooo glad we stayed even tho the wait time was 1/2hr because we were starving lol. (During the week days there's never been a wait for us) Well, with that being said it was quite busy. We had a chance to look at the menu during the waiting time so we knew what we wanted while being seated. We received our drinks and shortly after placed our order. The food took awhile to get to us, but it was a nice time spent enjoying the atmosphere and drinks. When the food arrived we got 1/2 our order (Cali eggs Benedict with sausage & side of French fries) and about 2-3min later the other 1/2 came out. (Bourbon vanilla French toast) the fries were hot and delicious. As well as the French toast, but the eggs Benedict & sausage were cold. (Reason why I can only give this place a 4 star) NOW, the flavor was still enjoyable so I don't feel 1 partial mistake should make for a bad review being that we attend quite often for lunch, (which is amazing) and haven't had cold food ever. My review is to simply be honest and informative for anyone new to this location. It's still a must try to anyone who visits Solvang.",4 star rating,Kayla F.

6/1/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Acting like a big bad wolf on the hunt for some pork, I decided to try the Succulent Cafe in Solvang. The photos posted on YELP looked intriguing enough to drive my wife and I to Solvang for the experience.We decided to start off with the roasted eggplant bruschetta which resulted in a disappointing experience. So we moved on to the roasted beet salad that had enough dressing for a small kiddie pool.For the entree I ordered the three little pigs plate and my wife ordered the spicy hen dish. The three little pigs was a bit awkward to eat and needed some green vegetables on the plate somewhere. My wife's dish was better than mine in flavor and a lot easier to eat than my 3 pigs and it came with veggies.Most definitely not the one of the best eating experiences we've had, falling way short of our expectations.This little bad wolf left this place huffing and puffing all the way home!Because this place was not worth the drive!",2 star rating,Simon S.
10/15/2020,"El Cajon, CA","My wife and I came to Solvang, CA to celebrate her 28th birthday. We decided to stop at Succulent Cafe for dinner the first night based of reviews and Hype of the place. Upon entering we were seated at a table. The waitress noticed dried up bird poop on the table and cleaned it wasn't a big deal but looked like it was there for a while and should have been cleaned before hand. We decided to order the Mac and cheese as a appetizer it was ok I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. For the main course I ordered the top sirloin steak (medium well)  with veggies and mashed potatoes. The steak was good a little under medium well but it was still fine with me. The mashed potatoes were good and the veggies were good. My wife ordered the burger no bacon well done. While eating I noticed her burger was rare at most and knowing her not liking any blood in her beef she was disgusted and couldn't eat anymore. We brought it to the waitress attention Audrey. She agreed 100 percent the meat was well undercooked and took it back and reiterated to us that she would get a new one but my wife lost her appetite. AUDREY our waitress apologized sincerely multiple times and was super sweet and the only 5 out of 5 stars there her customer service was amazing and we let her know it wasn't her fault, because I saw her write well done on the order. She complimented us with free dessert for my wife's birthday and recommended the flourless chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was delicious! I wouldn't return but however if you decide to go make sure Audrey is taking your order she is amazing made everything ok and tipped her purely based of her custom service or otherwise the food was not worth it. Thanks Audrey for making the experience much better then how bad it could have been.",3 star rating,Sarkar S.
9/23/2018,"Mission Hills, CA","Yes yes yes. Currently here now and it's our first time. It's a farm-to-table joint. This place was recommended to us by a wine pourer from a tasting room called Sort this out Cellars down the street. So we decided to come for brunch this Sunday morning. Upon driving up, we saw that it didn't look too busy so we didn't have to worry about waiting. It's a walk up and order then sit yourself down kinda place. We ordered the chicken and biscuit plate and the meatloaf and biscuit plate. They were AMAZING. The portions are perfect, not too big but still pretty substantial. The chicken was nicely fried with a little spicy kick to it (which is perfect, it gave another flavor dimension) and the gravy was tasty. The biscuits themselves are not too crumbly, like a cross between a biscuit and a bagel. Very good to hold up to the dish and not disintegrate and get lost in the sauce. The meatloaf was tender and the tomato sauce it was drenched in was delicious. One thing I'd add (which you can do add-ons) is a sunny side up egg on top of the hockey and biscuit dish. But still AMAZING on its own. Self serve water and drinks. All good!We will definitely come back and try other stuff on the menu.",5 star rating,Catherine V.

He was very satisfied with his meal.  The staff is friendly and pleasant. We really enjoyed dining on the outdoor, dog friendly patio. We plan on returning for dinner the next time we're in town. We will be enjoying the charcuterie and evening offerings.",4 star rating,Dianna M.

4/18/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I came here with a friend after doing a Yelp wine tasting event, and it did not disappoint! I got the country-style meatloaf and she got the mac and cheese appetizer. I haven't had too many meatloafs because the idea never appealed to me (I didn't grow up eating them) but this one was not dry at all and came with deliciously creamy mashed potatoes and flavorful succotash! I also tried my friend's mac and cheese and I think it was actually some of the best mac and cheese I've had. They did have a minor service slip-up--I asked to get my leftovers boxed up but they never brought it back to me, so I asked them about it. I guess whoever took it forgot they were supposed to put it in a box, but once I mentioned it to them, our waitress had the kitchen make me another half portion to make up for it! I normally would've been annoyed by something like this but they were so nice about it and the fact that they made me a fresh new portion to take home more than made up for the fact that they made a mistake. Plus, I brought my sister's dog and they were so friendly to him--they brought him a water bowl and even an adorable pig-shaped treat (very appropriate since he's a Frenchie). I also really enjoyed the outdoor patio--it was a great atmosphere and we even struck up a conversation with our dining neighbors.

4/14/2017,"Redwood City, CA","Welcome to Solvang, a place where a friend once described it as ""adult Disneyland"", with plenty of Danish references, weird wacky looking faux Scandinavian stuff, and a whole lot of wineries. I love the town, really, except it does get touristy, not in the same way as Napa or Paso Robles (which both have a great restaurant scene).I came here for a late lunch after a long walk around town. Ordered the tomato bruschetta and the grilled cheese sandwich -- and both are bland. Not only are the ingredients just not that great (the tomatoes are the least flavourful I've had on the west coast, and this was during tomato season!), balance and execution were also a problem. Both of the items I got had plenty of tasteless, not-quite-ripe tomatoes in them, and I pretty much just ate them for the sake of not being hungry.There were quite a few people in here, so perhaps I really just got the wrong thing and should've gone for the meaty dishes.

They did also provide jam with it which was tasted homemade. I ordered the roasted duck and it was so good. It was perfectly seasoned and just the perfect amount of food to fill a hungry belly. It came with rice and sauteed cauliflower which accompanied the duck. I also loved that their menu was not cluttered with a million items plus they had some daily specials.

They offered to comp my meal and asked if there was anything else I would like. I doubt it b/c I would not eat anything here after this revolting experience. Sure this place looks nice and all but service is lukewarm at best. Most importantly their food wasn't even properly prepared. Also they were closed from 3-5pm.

3/27/2019,"San Rafael, CA","Looking at their menu, I was hoping for dinner tonight to try out some items that caught my eye ... alas, life intervened, so I came here for lunch instead! Ha. The place is very nice, with a reasonably sized patio and interior dining area. You order breakfast and lunch at the counter and they bring you your order - dinner is more traditional service. They offer a nice variety of items for breakfast and lunch, and I settled on a grilled artisan cheese sandwich (Swiss, provolone & aged cheddar, basil, tomato, on grilled sourdough) and a side of pasta salad (other sides are fries or salad). The food came quickly and was served in a little wooden box crate - nice! The pasta salad had bow ties, an Italian type dressings but not too oily, and peppers and the slightest heat I only noticed toward the end. Just right to pop some flavor into might be a boring salad for some folks. The sandwich - nicely and colorfully presented, with tomatoes (a little too thick sliced for me, hard to bite through) and basil escaping, and enough cheese to give good balance in flavor. I'm a cheesaholic, so never too much cheese for me, but just a tad more would be good. The toast was lightly grilled, just right for this sandwich. The iced tea was easily refilled as staff was very attentive and present, delivering orders and clearing tables, and there were glass jugs of iced water readily available in ordering area and bar area of dining room. Other drinks included chilled bottles of specialty beverages or fountain sodas of your basic classics. For the price (it is Solvang, so think tourist economics) the price was decent. The salad was a bit smaller than I expected but not a deal-breaker. Overall, I'll be back - for dinner! - and for a breakfast/lunch experience was very pleased with everytin",5 star rating,Mark K.

When we first approached the hostess stand we were quickly waived off with an explanation of ""tonight is by reservation only"". Jumping on to Open Table we found an opening for 8 pm and about an hour later, when we proudly returned with our reservation, and were seated right away. While the seating and floor plan was a bit cramped and awkward the atmosphere and vibe from the crowd was welcoming. Our waitress was quick to attend to us and share the evenings specials.  We took our time reviewing the menu while we slathered tender, fresh out of the oven biscuits with a flavorful sweet and tart cherry jelly.  My BFF ordered one of the specials, the chimichurri chicken and I ordered the 3 little pigs. The plate presentations were simple and elegant with focus on the protein. She was not too thrilled with the chicken, stating it was a bit bland and she felt she probably should have gone with the meatloaf. My 3 little pigs, on the other hand, was heavenly! The pork tenderloin melted on my tongue with warm and earthy flavors filled with smokiness from the bacon. The sautéed spinach and potato cakes were an added bonus and finished the dish perfectly. I plan on returning for many more meals as I hope to make my way thru the entire menu!",4 star rating,Heidi J.

Most places in the area stop serving breakfast at 11:30, which is how we ended up at Succulent cafe. We ordered the succulent eggs Benedict and the Spicy Chicken sandwich and were not disappointed. The food was fantastic, especially the French fries and side of ranch dressing (which tasted homemade). The wait staff was very accommodating and very professional, despite looking very young.

5/6/2017,"Winnetka, CA","One of the few restaurants open late for dinner. A great find for us. Just enough excitement and a really interesting feeling to the bar and sit-down areas. Everyone enjoying both good service and very good food.   We were satisfied from beginning to end. Tables are small and close so sometimes service was a bit clunky. Not enough room to land a shared app, for instance. Tables close to bar seating so if the bar patrons pushed back, or as in our case... hang a backpack on the back of their stool, whoever sitting with their back to the bar gets bumped every time a server passes by. But everything was so enjoyable that getting bumped is a very minor thing. What we ate and liked: artichoke and feta app, fried chicken, duck, salmon, three piggies, cheesecake, ice cream parfait, flourless chocolate cake, their version of a Moscow Mule, Lemondrop, and their version of Irish Coffee. Oh... and a couple rounds of biscuits and jelly. We probably gained some weight but left happy and slept well!Will gladly return!",4 star rating,Brian S.

9/29/2016,"Riverside, CA","Made a pit stop in Solvang with my boyfriend and his family on our way back home from San Francisco! We were trying to make it there in time to go to one of Solvang's bakeries, but by the time we arrived all of them were already closed. So, we planned to eat dinner here instead! For our appetizers we ordered the Bacon Wrapped Diver Scallops and the Artisan Farmstead Cheeses to share. The scallops were to DIE for! They were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend said that it was good enough to be it's own entree! I wish it came with more scallops, but that's only because it was  just that good. I would recommend it to everyone! The Artisan Farmstead Cheeses was alright, though. Not sure if I'd order it again, but I'm glad I'm tried it out with everyone! It was a fun appetizer to share. I ordered the Three Little Pigs for my entree and it was also really good! The presentation of the food was beautiful and I could hardly finish it because I was so full after eating the appetizers, so I ended up sharing some with my boyfriend. But if I was hungry enough I'm sure I would have finished it all by myself!And for dessert we all shared the Lemon and Lavender Crusted Cheesecake which was a sweet way to end our dinner! I always have room for dessert and I'm glad we ordered it! This is a great restaurant to eat at if you are in Solvang! Our server was kind and attentive and the food was great!

9/11/2019,"Lompoc, CA","Came in for lunch and ordered their Bacon Burger with Fries and their Pastrami sandwich with their Garden Salad. The food was very very good. I didn't see beer on the menu but when we went into the dining room there was a full bar with several beers on tap, but no bartender.  When a young male server with a few tattoos came by I asked ""what do we do to get a beer around here"". He First told me to order where the food was ordered, so I said ""I was just hoping that you would pour me one"". He laughed and said what kind would you like? I chose the Danish Red Lager by Figueroa Mountain Brewing Co., so he poured me a pint in a frozen glass. I then asked if he could add it to our food tab, but he quipped ""it's on me"". Wow, not only was it so nice to pour me one, and it the beer was indeed fabulous, but on the house too... very nice of him. When the food arrived I devoured the burger, and when he walked by I had to ask him to compliment the chef. I wanted him know that this was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Beef was thick, medium rare as it was ordered, the bacon was thick apple smoked and cooked to perfection, and the Brioche Bun was toasted just the way I like it.  The server went and told the chef immediately. The Pastrami Sandwich was very good too, it had Swiss Cheese above and below the pastrami, and the Rye bread was the good dark variety. The only comment I can make to improve it this sandwich is maybe a little Dijon Mustard, or Shiracha, just enough to give it a little kick to put it over the top with flavor.There's a good reason this cafe is called the Succulent Café, the food is indeed succulent, I give it 5 stars. I come to Solvang every Wednesday, next week I plan on coming early so I can try their Eggs Benedict with Short Ribs hash, since a lot of Yelpers are raving about it. Suffice to say at this point that I highly recommend this place, so much so I purchased a Gift Certificate for a friend to come enjoy the place!",5 star rating,Russ R.

So you're lying to us in the beginning basically?After getting our food because ""let's try it, it might good"", we have no seat because of the waitress. We are waiting like fucking fools for a seat because the waitress didn't want us to have a table before we ordered (mind you, we were 3rd in line).After we get our seat and start to eat, our food is already cold because of the wait time we had to endure.

12/27/2018,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA","Finding gluten free and vegan options can be difficult in Solvang, however, the succulent cafe offers several delicious options for those with dietary restrictions. I had the fried chicken, which was delicious! And my vegan/gluten free friends had the sweet potato and peanut stew, which they loved. We also had some delicious desserts such as flourless chocolate cake, brown sugar cheesecake, caramel chocolate chip ice-cream and dairy free coconut chocolate ice-cream. All were scrumptious!! The restaurant itself was adorable, and is true to its name with the many large succulents decorating the patio. The atmosphere and lighting were very nice. The waiters and hosts was very kind. When trying to make a reservation, they were quite flexible about cancellations. Overall, the succulent cafe is perfect for all occasions, both fancy and casual, and is family friendly (they have a size-able kids menu)",5 star rating,Claire B.

We had already eaten- so didn't order any food- but we thought the wine glasses were cute and bought 4 of them to bring home with us. After arriving back home we noticed one of the wine  glasses had a chip in it. I emailed letting them know what happened. I was quickly responded back to with an offer to replace the glass by mail. It arrived packed securely within a week. Great customer service and a great save! Thank you! We will definitely be back and in the meantime- tell our friends to stop in when they visit. Cheers!",5 star rating,Bridget L.
5/6/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",Stopping by this cute little joint for some wine and cheese. We got the 3x3 charcuterie dish for 2 people ($33). I felt like it was definitely a bit pricey for what it was but it was still good regardless. This dish comes with 3 kinds of cured meat and 3 kinds of cheese as the name suggests along with dried fruits and pickled side dishes. I thought the amount was perfect for two people. One of the selected meat was a black truffle salami and it was my favorite. So flavorful and delicious. I also loved their pickled onions that made this dish not so heavy and the dried green grape for some added sweetness. They give you nice toasted bread to eat it with. Presentation was beautiful and I ordered a Chardonnay to pair with it all. I would have loved to try their other dishes as they sounded great too but by the time we finished our platter we were too full. The decor inside is nice and cute too also with outdoor seating area! Definitely check this place out if you are in the area!,4 star rating,SooYoung P.

1/19/2020,"Sunnyvale, CA",We were roaming on the street of Solvang trying to find a good place to eat and we stumbled upon this place. It was a busy Saturday night as all the restaurants were fully packed and so was this one. BUT we still decided to give it a try.. we were on waitlist and we waited no longer than 15 mins. What's funny is we were expecting a longer wait time so we went to a wine tasting place to kill some time and as soon as we got the call you bet I ran at a speed of light cause I was hungry and buzzed lol. We were seated outside on the patio. They had a heater on or else we wouldn't have survived the cold weather. This nice lady even offered us a blanket which was hanging by the door of entrance! How sweet! All the staff were super friendly and nice. I was even offered to use the staff restroom as the one for public was full lol. As for the food it's supper yummy and worth the hype. I got the spicy hen which was a chicken breast wrapped with bacon dipped on a creamy sauce with the side of mashed potatoes and green beans. It was a pricey menu but totally worth the price. Their friendly service and the yummy food really made my evening in Solvang better. Totally recommended!,5 star rating,Kritika P.
12/28/2019,"Gilroy, CA","Food was good.

1/11/2020,"San Francisco, CA","The service was great, but the food was mediocre at best. I would describe this meal as gussied up hospital food. Very little flavor.

7/28/2020,"CA, CA","My family visited this location for a sit-down meal (our first in ages). Service was fine and luckily mandated face masks for entry, but unfortunately other patrons around us removed their masks as soon as they sat down (perhaps this is out of the restaurant's control, though, especially considering how aggressively some customers can act about masks). We ordered the Beyond burger, salmon, crispy Brussels sprouts, and fries - all of our meals were good, but the Brussels sprouts were the star of the show. We recommend this location for a relaxing outdoor meal!",4 star rating,Grace H.

12/21/2017,"Gilbert, AZ","Do you want to have the best ice cream sundae of your life? The Succulent Cafe is a charming little winestaurant on the 246 hwy in Solvang. I was there for one reason: dessert.We were quickly seated and greeted on a Thursday evening. The dessert menu had enticed us upon hearing the first dish and the bench was deep. The three of us decided on the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, salted caramel bacon pecan sundae, and the brown sugar cheesecake with butterscotch sauce. We all ordered coffees that were  brought over quickly by our waitress, Kelly, who had just charmed us on the enchanted dessert menu and sadly, delivered the devastating news that the bread pudding had already sold out. Our dining experience began. The plates were delivered, the dessert roulette ensued and tastes were had by all. It hit every mark for dessert lovers anywhere. The bacon was thick and charred perfectly. The brown sugar blondie bits adorned the edges and were the definition of perfection. The chocolate cake rang out with its deep chocolate flavor and perfect sponge resonated like yodelers in the Swiss Alps, the smooth chill flavor of vanilla cascading down the tongue. But the cheesecake, I tell you, the cheesecake stole the show with its thick, rich, creamy body adorned with immaculately sweet butterscotch and puff of of whipped cremè and nearly burst my sweet tooth. The coffee was rich and tonal like a full bass quartet. The small homemade biscuits served before the meal with homemade jam will make you smile, warm your heart, and fill your belly with a perfect, light, buttery treat. The atmosphere and charm are off the charts, the service is phenomenal, thank you Kelly. Hands down I would recommend this establishment to anyone for any meal with confidence. You will surely have a delicious meal and a delightful time.",5 star rating,Jeff W.

To finish off my meal I had the chocolate cheese cake...I barely shared it with my friend's wife and feel bad about it now. I have also eaten here for breakfast and went to the other side with a counter and it is great food as well. Breakfast is awesome and I had the short ribs too.

Our finals were just cancelled so we had the day off before we all left to go back home. The appetizers were amazing, but my entree was quite disappointing. The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly but they ruined it with this sweet sauce. It wasn't for me and I only ended up eating half of it before letting my friends finish it. The service was amazing and food showed that the chef had skill but it was not to my palate.",4 star rating,Semarath B.

They have an extensive list of eclectic drinks as well for those that want something different. Eggs Benedict was large portion and fresh! Breakfast potatoes were also really good.The plate that stole the show however was definitely the FRENCH TOAST- hands down best french toast I've ever had.

It has braised short rib, roasted potatos, bell peppers, aged white cheddar, some onion and some salsa on the side. It was a very delicious dish, but it was also very rich. I got about half way through it before feeling how rich is was. If you dont mind waiting in the line to order, I reccomend this place.",4 star rating,Mariah R.

2/22/2018,"Belmont, MA","I was there with my best friend/sister. After having spent the afternoon at the Solvang farmers' market and shops, we were starving without reservations on Valentine's night. Succulent was able to seat us immediately at an ourdoor table right by the heater. Score.Our server (Ty was his name I think?) was great - very quick, courteous, and cheerful. He got us started on glasses of water & soda as well as hot biscuits and jam while examining the menu. The drinking glasses were thick greenish Coca Cola glasses: classic, heavy, legit. I wanted those glasses for my own dining room. I also wanted the biscuits on some sort of infinite installments. But, we don't get to have all the things we want in life. So we settled on the mango shrimp, tomato soup du jour, braised short rib, and steak. The shrimps never made it to the photo studio because we couldn't stop ourselves until the plate was clean. Please do yourself a favor and get them shrimps (unless you're allergic to shellfish or mango... in that case please get another appetizer that will very likely rock your world, in a good way. Please also inform your server of your allergies.)The soup was fine. Hearty, simple, not mind-blowing but comforting enough. Happy, and eager for more, I asked for biscuits refill. Hot biscuits came out promptly. I could've married that beautiful person who put those buttery sweet puffy pillows in front of us with such a smile. But, being shy, and still hungry, I went with the biscuits instead. For a moment I wondered if I got my life priorities straight. The thought quickly went away as our main dishes arrived: braised short rib for me, steak for my friend. The braised short rib came with caramelized onions and delta grind grits and broccoli. I'd thought of the duck but the rib won, partly thanks to our awesome server's recommendation. My friend felt like having a steak, and she enjoyed hers. For me, oh, I had no regrets. The rib fell apart so easily, no need for knife. Everything on my plate fit so well together, it felt like love. Didn't I mention this was Valentine's?Though Valentine's wouldn't be complete without desserts. She got the chocolate mousse/cake which neither of us liked. I got the crème brûlée which we both liked, partly because we would try this dessert everywhere we go to ease our intense longing for the crème brûlée at the late Finale in Boston (RIP). We both felt that Succulent's crème brûlée was the closest it'd been to our all-time favorite. I asked her, rhetorically, if we might need to return to Solvang just to get this crème brûlée. It's only two hours from LA. And for me, coming from Boston, eight hours.But I digressed. Succulent was a fantastic choice. Next time we were in Solvang again I would love to visit Succulent again. Now you go, and have a wonderful time!",5 star rating,Lily T.

12/12/2018,"Riverside, CA",I was kind of disappointed with the charcuterie here which surprised me. I went here cause I thought that was kind of their thing but I can say I've had better boards and for cheaper. They don't give you a lot of meat and cheese just a lot more of the other stuff like the olives and nuts.. one thing I did like was all the bread because a lot of times I feel like I don't have enough for everything on the board and the hot jelly they gave me was delicious on the bread. They gave us biscuits which looked good but I couldn't tell you because my bf ate them all! Lol He loved them. The other thing I was kind of put off by was the attitude when we asked for a table. It wasn't really that busy especially the outside area and we were asked if we made a reservation and when I said no she told us to go to the bar.,3 star rating,Crystal K.

The bacon was crispy and ohhhh so succulent. Yummmm I can't stop thinking about it.My only gripe is the long wait in line just to order since they only have one cashier, and unfortunately the cooks got our orders wrong! We had to send back 3 meals because they were all screwed up. Aside from that the waiters were apologetic,  friendly and kind enough to fix that for us. Hence the 4 stars!Everyone was pleased with their meal and the prices are pretty affordable here for what you get. They don't take lunch reservations so you just order and seat yourself. If you're coming for dinner they do require reservations. They have indoor/outdoor seating. I loved sitting outside enjoying the nice weather and view of Solvang. Looking forward to going back.

The board had a little of a lot and gave me ideas on how I could present one at a party. Visiting from Hawaii, it is often to find a brown ale other than the two typically available so I was happy to try a new one. If you sit inside, there are interesting pieces of artwork to look at as well as an impressive wine wall. We came a little after lunch time during the week and it was not crowded. Outside eating area definitely had more patrons as it should-great weather and people watching. This is a def win.",5 star rating,Ann N.

I am in the area about once a month and always end up eating at the same old places.  This is one of the nicer places that I've eaten at in Solvang. It is on the pricier side.  I had dinner here by myself on Wednesday night and it was fairly busy. I wanted to try the three little pigs, but they were sold out for the day. So instead I got the fried chicken.  It wasn't bad, it came with some veggies and Mac and cheese.  I was also recommended the brussels sprouts.  It comes in a huge order that probably 3-4 people could easily share.Parking: tons of street parking or parking in the public lot across the street.",4 star rating,Jeff L.

It's dog friendly, decently priced, and full of flavor and innovation. The only downside was the first come, first served seating-- only because we had a group of 8. The staff, however, were very helpful and helped us get a table as soon as one was available and were able to join it with another table. This will definitely be our spot when we visit solvang.",5 star rating,Daniel M.
1/20/2019,"Pomona, CA","I went in hoping to get the spicy chicken sandwich buuuuut I was 4 minutes past 5pm, which apparently I could only order before 5 smh....wasn't thrilled about that because that's all I could really eat since I'm currently pregnant. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, which if you want simple plain chicken, that's what you get, unfortunately mine was still pink inside which instantly made me nauseous so we had them take it away.....thankfully they were willing to let me order something else but I was already in the restroom and was not in the mood for anything after that. They were respectful enough to not charge us for it, but I'm sure if I was able to eat more things than just my spicy chicken, this review could've been five stars.....the truffles were delicious the bread was super warm and my husband enjoyed his catch of the day.",4 star rating,Carol C.

I liked the relaxed atmosphere which is on par with the Santa Ynez Valley. They even cater to pets..yay. When you walk around Solvang, you'll see lots of shops and restaurants closing quite early, so they are probably one of the few that remained open. Wow! Their house biscuits and jam is so delish. Don't hesitate to ask for seconds. The ingredients were fresh and will be back when we get a chance to visit again.",4 star rating,Dim S.

9/8/2015,"Long Beach, CA","When I started writing this review, I rated this place 4 stars. While I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here, I'm definitely a fan. But after drafting the rest of this review and remembering a really good experience, I thought ""why not give this place 5 stars?""Major props to Succulent Cafe for offering a legit tasty Grilled Vegetable Sandwich. Eggplant, spinach, red onion, roasted red bell pepper and balsamic vinaigrette on ciabatta. But the real star of the sandwich was the most flavorful portobello mushroom I've ever had. I'm not sure how it was cooked or what it was cooked in, all I know is that it was delicious! It exceeded my expectations for sure! bit.ly/1iw9aSuThe Meateater BF had the NY Black Smoked Pastrami. He pretty much says that it's one of the best pastrami sandwiches he's ever had.The fries were pretty amazing too! Perfectly tender on the inside with just a bit of crispiness on the outside. I mean, it's official name on the menu is Crisp French Fries and it truly lived up to it. It came with a sauce that seemed like salsa but the Meateater BF claims that it might have been homemade ketchup. Whatever it was, it was good. bit.ly/1IXGTt7The atmosphere seemed pretty casual upon first glance. Lots of tables outside and there was a line slightly out the door when we arrived for lunch. The wait was pretty quick though. After we ordered at the counter, we found a table in the indoor dining area. The decor reminded me of one of those hip gastropubs. The prices do reflect similar high prices of a hip gastropub but considering the quality of the food, I think it's worth it. The service is also helpful and extremely friendly. Even their smiles seem very genuine! I appreciate that sort of thing :)So as I was saying before, I was about to give this place 4 stars. But considering all the good things I have to say, why not give this place 5 stars? :)",5 star rating,Harmonie T.

We had to wait 50 minutes at 7pm. There isn't much open at night in Solvang, so this place is poppin off!We were seated inside. It's cute in there, but the patio is adorable! I wish we had been seated out there - oh well, next time I will make reservations and request that. Service was good, everything happened pretty fast, all the people we encountered were nice.They bring you little biscuits with chardonnay jam when you are seated. They are really good!We started with the Crispy Brussels Sprouts. They have bacon and a balsamic fig reduction. The portion is very large for an appetizer and we ended up taking these home. They were so good that I felt they were worth the drive all the way back down the coast!For dinner he had the Succulent Bacon Burger. It was really good, but slightly overcooked. I told him to send it back, but he didn't want to. I am sure they would have made him another one. The fries were good.I had the Smoked BBQ Meatloaf which is served with buttermilk mashed potatoes, bacon gravy and succotash. Honestly, this was perfect, there was not one component of this dish that I did not enjoy.We both agreed that we will have another meal here next time we are in Solvang.

6/28/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","The food wasn't that special.  Maybe there isn't that much competition around here that it's easy to be one of the highest/most rated restaurants in the area.  We got the fried chicken with macaroni and cheese and it was good, but again, nothing special since I've had better flavors elsewhere.  The most unique and memorable thing I got was the Smoked Onion Blue Cheese Dip served with crostini and crackers.  It was delicious, though kind of salty, but the flavors made this an excellent appetizer.The service is okay.  The hostess is completely clueless on how to seat people.  A simple question we asked was ""Do you have any seating for 4?"" and she was like ""I'm not sure.. I'll have to check"", then she ran inside to check.  Ever heard of a radio or having more staff to help go in to scout the restaurant for seating?Also, if you are Asian, their service is even more passive, and they just stare at you in silence, hoping you'll go away.  I saw this trend when the hostess dealt with other Asian tourists/families.  I had to point out to the hostess when I noticed that some customers just left, and asked if we could take their table.  We ended up sitting outside but noticed that when they brought the outdoor heaters, they gave priority to the other patrons.  We had to lean to get some heat.  It was only when the other patrons left that they finally reluctantly scooted the heater our way.  Definitely not returning here for my next visit!",1 star rating,Loretta C.

It comes in a basket that includes a pickle. Overall, it's an AOK meal for the price. ~Service-2 StarsService was lacking and I was a bit disappointed. We were just handed the menu at the register with no real greeting or explanation of the menu. They do have an outdoor patio area which is nice. I brought out our drinks and cleared my table after.

The cheeses were good but the meats were pretty mediocre especially for a charcuterie. The salami and soprasso were tasteless and dry. Pretty disappointing.

Their cheese and meat platters are really good; includes all the essentials and in good portions! Good selection on beer and wine. Only criticism was that their coke was flat, and apparently they were out of carbonation, and therefore no sodas! The food really made up for all of that? My rack of lamb was one of the best I've have and for $36, it's a great value. The lamb burger was also really good. Portion sizes are good, filled me up.

5/30/2018,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA","This place should have 5 stars from everyone but their logistics are quite poor. Positives: adorable place in Solvang, outdoor seating that cute and shaded and perfect for a nice day out. Food is delicious, big portions, served fresh with organic ingredients, great variety on the menu and everything tastes good. On the main street so if you cant find parking, try the street behind it, we were lucky to find a few spots. Staff are friendly and polite.Cons: lack of organization and VERY slow service. When we arrived there was a line out the door. We couldn't figure out if we had to be seated or not, and after waiting out front we realized you had to order your food first then find a seat. There's no signage to give people direction, and out of towners aren't going to have a clue. Not to mention, the gentleman behind the counter was taking his time with the order. We were in line for 40 minutes, it was ridiculous. If you see you're that busy you really should come up with a better system and take multiple orders at a time if possible.Still, great place to try, if you're in town check it out just expect to wait a while and know the process, wait in line and order, if you have multiple people in your group try to grab a table while they wait in line.",3 star rating,Taleen K.
6/26/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","3.5 StarsWe stopped here for a late lunch while on a family trip.  The place looked charming from the outside and gave off a leisurely vibe.  However, we were a little confused when we entered.  The entrance straight ahead is where you go to place your order and the entrance to the right is where you pick a table and wait for your food to arrive.  You can also sit in the courtyard.The slow roasted pork sandwich I got was good but not great.  I did enjoy the pork (maybe because I was hungry) but I found it a tad dry.  The sandwich was a bit spicy too.  I didn't see that in the description anywhere!  I did like the fresh arugula though.  My husband got the succulent bacon burger and it came with fries.  He inhaled that burger!  And I couldn't stop myself from stealing his fries.  Our toddler thoroughly enjoyed their chunky PB&J.  They slathered those spreads on thick yummy toasts.  Oh and I ordered a strawberry lemonade that was on the sweeter side.This place has room for improvement, or should I say, it has great potential?  I'd stop here again if I wanted a simple, quick bite to eat.",3 star rating,Sophia G.
5/25/2019,"Sacramento, CA","W A R N I N G! RAW MEAT ALERT! I am writing this review to make the general public aware of a situation that I now find myself in. I am a bonafide foodie, born and raised in the country, I strive to eat all organic - all the time! I have raised animals for food, grown all kinds of edible plants/trees and even know how to make my own preserves. I was quite pleased when I first discovered the quaint town of Solvang. Having lived in small towns for most of my life, I instantly felt at home. I am however not pleased with several recent experiences at succulent cafe. The most recent dining experience was one that I will never forget. This restaurant had the audacity to serve my fiancè completely RAW CHICKEN (see attached photo). As in not cooked at all in the middle. They somehow managed to blacken it just enough on the outside that she was not able to tell that she was served deadly food for the first few bites. She only realized that it was raw after it was too late. I can confirm that it was raw. Pink, uncooked and disgusting! Thank God I am a student of the healing arts. I sprung to action and immediately gave my fiancé several activated charcoal pills. This is surely the only reason she did not end up in the hospital or possibly worse. She did however have explosive diahhrea, nausea, and vomiting for roughly a week. She is a new mother of a small infant currently breastfeeding. So this idio*ic move by restaurant staff could not ONLY HAVE KILLED MY FIANCÉ WITH TOXIC SALMONELLA BACTERIA. IT COULD ALSO HAVE HARMED MY CHILD. AS HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO EAT SOLID FOOD. THANK GOD WE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY THINKING IT WAS SAFE! For who would assume they would be served raw meat?To add insult to injury- the restaurant has been completely arrogant about the whole experience. Some sle*zy manager calls us up after we let the restaurant know they served us death chicken and he arrog*ntly replies ""they are the best restaurant in Solvang."" I am aware that most of the eateries in town are simply ""tour*st tr*ps"" but thats just disgusting and completely immoral, illegal and unethical to serve RAW chicken. How long before this kind of sloppiness gets someone killed? The restaurant does not seem to care at all. All rights reserved. Without prejudice.",1 star rating,A.B. C.

His biscuits and gravy was simply divine! I'm practically salivating just remembering how good it was!So I had ordered my sandwich without tomatoes, but somehow it still came with tomatoes.

The wait staff offered the option of sitting at the bar--or outside with the temperature dropping below 60 as the sun set. We opted for the bar to check out the draft beer selection. The menu was limited but we both agreed on appetizers/small plates from the Happy Hour menu. My husband was delighted with his three sliders--a generous portion compared to the measly dish of shrimp and grits. The shrimp were on the small side and there was perhaps a tablespoon on grits to accompany the five shrimp.

Our server finally came by, explaining that there was confusion as to which server was responsible for our table. We ordered a flat bread and a salad to share. The order came out in less time than it took for us to wait for a server. The sauce did not seem fresh and the flat bread was luke warm.

Still decently busy, but customers were going up to the counter asking when their food was going to be ready. We got the charcuterie fairly quickly. 2 pork meats, 1 lamb meat, three good cheeses.

6/24/2017,"Santa Rosa, CA","We arrived in Solvang without any dinner reservations. Due to an allergy, we need gluten free food. We walked along the Main Street through town and happened upon Succulent. We asked and were told that they could accommodate someone with a gluten allergy. We were also told that no tables were available, but that we could eat at the bar. This often works out even better for us because I have a significant hearing loss, and sitting side by side helps. We decided to give it a go. Nelida was working behind the bar and was our server. She was knowledgeable about gluten intolerance and guided us through the menu. She was also helpful in selecting local beer and wine. Nelida was a great server and helped make the evening a fun memory. They served us biscuits and jam, and because I am not the one with the allergy, I was able to enjoy them alone! They were soft, tasty, and warm. They had the perfect combination of savory and sweet with the jam spread on top. We ordered the gluten free sausage, arugula, and red onion pizza. It arrived promptly and was delicious. The sausage had a bit of a bite, which added to its flavor. The sausage is made on site. A wonderful, tasty meal with pleasant and fun service. We'd go back!

12/27/2016,"San Francisco, CA","My family and I ate here for lunch yesterday. Right off the bat, the host at the front was very friendly and informative. Succulent is a take on a fast-food style restaurant, except it's not fast. You wait in line (~10-15 min) during lunch time to order, then you find a table to sit at - inside or outside. They'll come find you when your food is ready with the table number they give you. The guy at the register had very good customer service. We ordered lemonade for everyone, a spicy fried chicken salad, succulent bacon burger, short rib hash, & another item I can't remember lol. The spicy fried chicken salad and the short rib hash were delicious!!! Would definitely recommend. The succulent bacon burger was okay. It wasn't great, but wasn't bad. The other thing we ordered was okay as well, nothing to brag about. They offer alcoholic beverages as well. Wish I was able to try a mimosa! Probably would have stopped me from checking how long it took to receive our food :POnly cons are how long we had to wait for our food. 30 minutes total. I'd come back again and get the short rib hash instead of the burger, especially for the wait time! I'd also love to try their charcuterie & cheese with wine. It was family time this time around, so no drinking for me. Maybe next time with a group of my girls :)",4 star rating,Kristine H.
8/6/2018,"Hewlett, NY","SO good. Came here for lunch with my four friends. Two of us got the grilled artisan cheese sandwich, one with ham and the other with turkey. Another got the Cobb salad and the other had the fried chicken sandwich. The lack of one star is because they forgot to add the turkey on mine and her piece of chicken was small; even so, it was great and I highly recommend.",4 star rating,Sammi B.
4/21/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","We picked this place for breakfast because the menu looked different and they had outdoor seating. And because we didn't feel like waiting 40 minutes for the pancake place nearby. Breakfast biscuits with all sorts of pork seemed to be their specialty, so we decided to go with that. When the food arrived, I slowly realized I must have been brain dead when I was ordering - I do not like biscuits or gravy and can't have pork. Without having any coherent explanation, I actually had the audacity to ask them to switch my order. It never hurts to ask, right? And they did! They gave me this beautiful, fresh, colorful and flavorful salmon bagel, which was amazing! Best customer service ever!!! I apologized profusely and they didn't make a big deal out of it at all - thank you, ladies! We ended up hanging out for an hour or two, because their outside seating is just so lovely, and their coffee is brewed every 10 minutes inviting you for endless refills :) Great spot! Dog friendly. People (!) friendly. Give it a try.",4 star rating,Svetlana S.

8/20/2018,"Anaheim, CA","First and foremost Solvang is such a beautiful city and Succulent Cafe is the perfect spot to take it all in. Succulent Cafe is a cute a little sit in restaurant where you can just sit outside or inside and sip on some wine and enjoy a bountiful and delicious charcuterie board while you soak in the environment and people watch. For this visit not only did the boyfriend and I enjoy a cheese board with three different cheeses, meat variety, dried fruit, and awesome jam we also indulged with a delicious sandwich and hamburger. Needless to say we left Succulent stuffed. The service was friendly and efficient. These folks really know their stuff so my advice is if you feel stuck on what to order, just ask - they got your back. Just be wary though that at a certain time in the afternoon they do close their kitchen, but they still serve drinks!",5 star rating,Georgia M.

I popped in to see if they could make us a to go cheese place for our day...mmmmmmm cheese. We had 2 delicious mimosas while we waited for our plate to be prepared. Great patio seating and dog friendly. After about 15 minutes, Ty the chef hand delivered a masterpiece of cheeses, meats, nuts, pickled veggies and toasted bread. He packaged it all to make it picnic friendly and it was truly delicious and amazing. Totally makes my day when people go above and beyond!

7/28/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","I just had the most amazing dinner, probably ever, here. This place has everything the perfect restaurant needs: excellent food, superb service (shout out to Errol for being the most amazing waiter and really making our experience at this place incredible and perfect), and cool atmosphere (with a bar that serves some delicious drinks). Came here with the family, including two teenagers, and there was something for everyone (even the pickiest eater). The complimentary biscuits and jam are so delicious and the perfect precursor to the amazing meal I had. The tropical pig cocktail was also super refreshing, I would highly recommend. Bacon wrapped scallopsThe bacon wrapped scallops were divine, the scallops were juicy and perfectly cooked, the bacon was crispy and super flavorful, and that sauce on top gave it that perfect spicy kick. Three Little PigsYou must try this dish. It's their speciality and they execute it perfectly. The creamed spinach, is on top of a crispy potato cake that's creamy on the inside. The bacon wrapped tenderloin will blow your mind.Braised short ribPerfectly seasoned and braised to perfection. A nice portion too! Cattleman's steakThis was sirloin steak and it was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy, with a side of killer mashed potatoes with all the yummy fixings on top (cheddar & bacon). Fried Chicken with Mac n cheeseTastes like your regular fried chicken, but not dried out. Out of all the dishes I had this was the least exciting, but still good. Bacon burgerMy sisters said this was the best burger they've had and they've had lots of burgers. One burger can easily feed two. Creme brûlée Decadent, creamy, perfectly caramelized. Perfect way to end your meal.",5 star rating,Isabel S.
1/15/2017,"Torrance, CA","Let me sum this up for you: ""not bad, but not amazing"". The food:I picked the spicy fried chicken salad because I saw some high praises on Yelp. The food arrived and it was beautiful! It was colorful and made my mouth water. As far as the taste goes, the fried chicken was very well breaded and the balance of flavors was NEARLY perfect. The reason why this review is so low is because of the service and my issues with the chicken. The chicken was slightly overcooked, and ""spicy"" is a strong word to use when referring to this dish. If anything, the chicken was slightly sour. I do have to say that the dried cranberries, corn bread croutons and pepitas were a perfect choice to pair with the fried chicken. Was that enough to make this dish amazing? No. The service: The service was my other issue with this restaurant. As a new customer, I had no idea how the food ordering system works. Let me give you the 411. You order at the counter first and then follow a sign to your table where you wait an approximate 40 minutes (it happened to be 60 minutes for the woman sitting behind me) for your food to finally appear! We initially started walking toward the dining room, thinking this was a to-go ordering counter and were quickly reprimanded for walking that way by the cashier. She then took our order in a cold and not inviting tone. A chilly start to our meal for sure.My issues with the service really end there. The servers were extremely friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant is light and airy. Would I come back? Maybe. Now that I know how the ordering system works and I won't get scolded the next time I come in, I may feel more invited into this restaurant. Come in and check it out. The decor is pretty and the food is aesthetically pleasing. Please, just be wary of the long wait and the proper ordering etiquette.",3 star rating,Melissa T.

The biscuit and honey was soooo soft and crispy at the same time. You guys MUST order this along side your meal... it is to die for! . My daughter got the tuna melt... again yummy.

12/30/2014,"Las Vegas, NV","Lovely ambiance. Few tables by the window that have a gorgeous view of the town. I recommend you make a reservation to get these seats. The seats outdoors also look pleasant, but way too cold during the winter even with their heating lamps. They serve mini biscuits with homemade jam as a starter and these were soo good! I would've filled up on these if we didn't order so much food.French fries were served with this ketchup that was more tomato sauce, less ketchup. We got a side of ranch which I actually really enjoyed and I don't normally like ranch. Also ordered the 2x2 charcuterie x cheese platter which I really enjoyed. It came with a large assortment of fresh and dried fruits, various nuts, and pickled veggies. Ended up taking more than half of it to go and it was still just as delicious as a late-night snack.Upon ordering their braised short-rib for dinner, they notified us that it wasn't yet ready and it would take about 20 minutes before it would come out. We came in just as they opened for dinner so we were okay with this. However, our entrées took over 40 minutes to come out. It was lucky we order two starters along with their biscuits or we would've extremely unhappy with the wait. Nonetheless, the short-rib was very tender and flavorful, but the grits it was served on top of was super whatevers. Also had the pork belly porchetta - again the pork was good, but the white beans it was served on top of was too salty.Great place to dine with a feel of still being in Solvang. Staff was friendly and service was good.",4 star rating,Shirlene L.

I ordered the steak, which was delicious paired with the bacon and cheese mash (yes, delish!). My cousin ordered the salmon with rice pilaf which was just as delicious. Someone else in our group ordered the pizza and my hubby got the chicken which he loved! Everything was so tasty, and our pups loved their beef patty just for them. Our server Errol was a delight as well! Recommended all the best dishes and was always so attentive to our needs (and our pups needs too!). He brought a bowl of water for them which I thought was super nice, and even gave them some biscuit treats. Our group really loved him. Check out this place if you're in the area even if you don't have pups. Easy to find and just great food and atmosphere overall.

8/26/2018,"Glendale, CA","If there were one word to describe or dining experience here, it would be bland! My wife ordered the catch of the day special, which was the halibut, she said it was bland and dry. Her rice was flavorless and the broccoli was boiled and again bland. My burger wasn't seasoned at all and the kitchen forgot to add the bacon to it. Once I received the bacon, the burger was alright but nothing to write home about. The homemade biscuits and jelly were good and the fries were good. Service was mediocre at best. We were only checked on about 3 or 4 times. Once to take our order, another because we had to get our waitresses attention because the kitchen forgot my bacon, third time to see if everything was ok and lastly for our check. I get that everything in Solvang closes at 7 PM or earlier but this place is open until 9 PM, they should excel and take pride in what they serve their guests.

12/31/2014,"Alameda, CA","Dear Succulent,Ah yes, I found you in the little town of Solvang.Small, Quaint, but Awesome town in the middle of nowhere.I looked on yelp for lunch and there you were, sitting pretty at the top with a ton of good ratings, so I had to check you out with the folks.I ran inside because your lunch time ends at 3 and it was 2:50. I was surprised at how packed your place was despite it being nearly 3pm. Who eats at 3PM! Well I guess people like me...At first I was looking for seats, but then realized here, I was to order at the counter, so I quickly got a bunch of orders in before the kitchen closed and easily found a sweet spot outside.Ambiance was nice especially the tables outside, felt like I was sitting in a little cafe in Europe somewhere, which is odd since I've never been to Europe. But I guess this is how I would imagine it to be like. The town itself has massive Danish and European influences anyway. Clearly nice little tourist spot since, well there were surprisingly so many asian people in this neighborhood, again in the middle of nowhere. Again, I guess I would be one of those...ANYWAYS. We had...Buttermilk Chicken Salad- Very Good and looked like it was in the yelp pictures.- Chicken was good. Salad was good. Hushpuppies were great especially in the crisp cold weather.Rib sandwich- Pretty good. Nice mix of flavors. Nothing fancy, but filled the tummy good enough. It felt more like a pulled pork sandwich, but whatever.Fish sandwich- Threw me off. I thought there would be fish in this sandwich, but it was actually shrimp. It clearly says shrimp on the written menu, so I guess it is my fault, but why call a shrimp sandwich.. and fish sandwich. It was good, but I just couldn't enjoy it because I was looking forward to fish... oh first world problems!Pot of Fries- Yes a POT of fries. Very creative. It wasn't on the menu but everyone and their mother was ordering it. Every table had it and I couldn't resist so I asked for it.Anyhow, it was a solid choice and enjoyed my time there. Would have liked to tried some of the dinner dishes but we were going through this town during our LA to SF drive up. Very nice place to take a walk afterwards to work it all off.Anyhow, hope to see you again... though to be honest if I visit this town again, I'll probably check out a new place.. sorry!!Blame the SHRIMP Sandwich!!

9/2/2016,"Encino, CA","On our mini vacation in Solvang we decided to stop here for dinner after looking up a few places on Yelp. The reviews were excellent and it was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel. Once we arrived, we were greeted by a nice lady who sat us by the window. The place was pretty spacious and the atmosphere was relaxing. They had a bar area with a few people having a drink while families were there having an early dinner after work. Our waiter was awesome! He was super friendly, funny and took care of all of our needs. The only reason why this place gets a 4 rating is because there were flies in the place that were irritating the hell out of us. Our waiter would come by and try to fan them away while we were fanning the whole time. It became extremely annoying and it was an unfortunate situation. As for the food, we ordered the shrimp appetizer with lettuce and avocado, Chilean sea bass with stir fried veggies and rice and a Moscow pig (similar to a Moscow mule). My fiancé ordered the steak with mash potatoes and baby asparagus. They also gave complimentary fresh baked biscuits with jam. Everything was delicious but the only setback I had with the food was the rice and stir fried veggies tasted like something from Trader Joes. We LOVE Trader Joes but when you feel like you can get something from Trader for the price your paying here, it makes you question things a little. Overall, despite there being flies and the rice and veggies tasting like it came from Trader Joes, I'm still giving this place a rating of 4 because the rest of the food was good, drinks were great and we had a good time. I would come back again!OOOO4 out of 5 Afros",4 star rating,EJ J.

Ok, it had good reviews too but still!We wanted to stop by Solvang on our way south to eat pastries at Mortensen's Danish Bakery, but we arrived after they had closed. We decided to just eat dinner and leave. I'm glad we chose this place because I was amazed by the food and presentation!We started with appetizers. My girlfriend wanted to try the Bacon Wrapped Diver Scallops. You really cannot go wrong with bacon so this was the perfect starter. I recommend it!My main course was the Buttermilk Marinated Chicken Breast. Now, I only chose this one because my girlfriend already chose the Three Little Pigs and she was bound to give me some to try. Anyways, although I chose my dish to not get the same thing my girlfriend got, I was really glad I got mine! The chicken breast was amazing! It had a subtle sweet taste, and the chicken was not dry like I expected it to be. I couldn't stop eating it! The mac n' cheese and collard greens that came with it were also very good! I couldn't believe I was only gonna choose it as a ""last resort"" plate. I definitely underestimated it!We finished off with dessert, and since I couldn't get my pastry from Mortensen's, I figured I might as well. We picked the cheesecake out of the long recommendation list. It was delicious. We were all very full but the cheesecake was so good, we finished it in less than a minute.Great place to eat!

The mac was good, smoky creamy goodness. The veggies were flavorful and perfectly cooked, but the chicken was dry and a bit tough. I think it may have been a bit overcooked.My wife ordered the 2+2 charcuterie platter and was amazed by all it held. She liked the meats and cheeses but left much of the other stuff because she couldn't figure out how to combine jalapeños, raisins, and beets into a tasty bite. Overall she enjoyed it!We skipped dessert opting for ice cream at a local spot, but the selection sounded appealing.Ambiance is cottage home, service was very prompt, and prices were in line with expectation for the locale.I can't say I'll be back considering the number of options in this destination, but that should not stop anyone from giving it a shot...but this joint does not make the list.",3 star rating,Jason B.
10/27/2016,"Whittier, CA","This is a very overdue review. Date of visit was 09/10/2016.Spent the day at Solvang since we wanted to know more of the town and Hans Christian Anderson (as I am a very big Snow Queen/Frozen fan), and were looking for a place to eat. Since we weren't familiar with any of the restaurants there, we kind of went off the vibes given off by the restaurants in Solvang.Walked by this restaurant and heard them playing Vampire Weekend and that's what brought us in. Good music = Great atmosphere. Glad we made that choice! The restaurant seemed very well kept and clean, which was a big plus. Also reminded us of a cute modern cafe that had ample indoor and outdoor space. It was around brunch hours, but I ordered a burger for myself and my boyfriend ordered a sausage and egg breakfast. To be honest, we were both expecting it to taste like any other restaurant food, but IT WAS AMAZING. You can honestly taste all the flavors and the food looked appealing as well! Highly recommended if you are in the area and are newbies, like we were, looking for a great place to eat!Also wanted to note: One thing I do regret is not getting the names of our servers. It was two males, one really tall guy that kept rooting for me to finish the giant burger of mine, and the other was wearing converse I believe.

1/1/2018,"Monterey Park, CA","My boyfriend and I came here on our way back down to LA from San Luis Obispo. We got the Eggs Benedict, one with sausage and the other with bacon, the lemonade and the iced tea. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, the sausage, and the iced tea but the Eggs were entirely overcooked. It did not have a runny yolk at all. The poached egg of an Eggs Benedict is the best part of Eggs Benedict. I enjoyed the biscuit it came on because it had a slight crunch to it and the hollandaise sauce was delicious. They place the added proteins on the side instead of on the biscuit itself. The lemonade was extremely tart and not enjoyable at all. It was also more expensive than the other drinks on the menu. I was honestly upset by the lemonade. The bacon was nothing to write home about. Overall I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict but for $16 ($13 +$3 for meat), I was expecting the eggs to actually be poached. I don't think that's too much to ask. We're slightly disappointed with our experience considering that this place is the 2nd most reviewed place after Paula's.",3 star rating,Beverly L.

The Fried Chicken & Gravy Biscuit (buttermilk fried chicken, bacon, aged cheddar, & gravy) was also a hit. Their gravy is ridiculously good. Everything on their menu sounds good to me...Shortrib Hash n' Eggs, Bourbon Vanilla French Toast.For dinner we sat outside on the patio with our dog. We had the most charming waiter, Errol. I usually don't really notice the server unless they are atrociously bad, but this guy was really GREAT! We started with the special shrimp salad - superb, then had the Succulent Meatloaf with bacon gravy and the Grilled Duck Breast with orange gastrique. Both were exemplary.

The thing that stood out for me the most was the incredible service; the employees were smiling and happy to serve you.  Even the guy that was bussing tables was a higher caliber person. My ten year old son even commented on how happy the employees were. In a day where customer service is vanishing, Succulent really shines!",4 star rating,Sarah D.
6/4/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Their charcuterie board is the BOMB. We came in here after seeing pictures, and ordered the eggplant dip and charcuterie board to share during the happy hour. We also got drinks, and I got the lemon drop which was decent.The food came out quickly, and I was so impressed at the amount of food and toppings on the charcuterie board! We chose the 3 meats and 3 cheeses ($33), but it came with so many additional sides. The meats included soppressata, duck prosciutto, and truffle salami. For cheese, we got the sage cheddar, mustard cheddar, and French Brie. Everything was so good, and I fell in love with the sage cheddar! The truffle salami was delectable as well. As for the eggplant dip, I don't like eggplant but this one was tasty! It had a type of cream cheese on the bottom which added to it.We actually came back for dinner as my friend wanted the burger. The burger meat was juicy and it was solid, but not out of this world. The mushroom toast I would not recommend ordering as it was more dry. Definitely a must if you love charcuterie! Happy hour prices are great, and although it is a smaller spot, they do have indoor and outdoor seating. Cute little cafe we really enjoyed!",4 star rating,Celine L.
12/25/2017,"Sunnyvale, CA","Yummy little restaurant with some great tomato bisque and little scones for the table. My husband really enjoyed his fried chicken, greens, and Mac and cheese. I love that there were vegan and vegetarian options. Shitake mushrooms we're flavorful if a little dry. But the soup and apple cider mimosa were delicious! Service was friendly and very pleasant. Highly recommend if you're in the Solvang area.",4 star rating,Evonne L.

6/2/2016,"Culver City, CA","Was very excited about this place cause it was one of the highest yelped places in the area. Walked inside and requested to sit on the far end table near the wine cellar and was given a dirty look as if they were going to save it for another large group coming in. Came with my whole family of four and spent $100 on a Caesar salad ($12), meatloaf ($24) and a piece of baby chicken ($24). It still doesn't make sense how a piece of chicken wing can cost $24 or Half a Caesar salad costing $12. The service was mediocre. Erroll was our server who was very energetic but was also very pushy on trying to sell us on ordering different things on the menu when I said ""no thank you, that is all."" All of our drinks were nearly empty and I had to call another server to refill them.Overall, extremely dissatisfied with the service and food portions; never had to pay $24 for a piece of chicken in my life ever",1 star rating,Moo Bin L.

7/1/2016,"Sunnyvale, CA","I was a bit hesitant on coming here, after going through most of the 'meh' reviews. But there are good reviews as well, so I decided to try my luck. I made a reservation right on their website for 5 PM -- the time that they open up again for dinner. I'm glad I chose 5 PM because by the time we finished our dinner at around 6, 6:30 ish, the place was packed![[Bacon Wrapped Diver Scallops,$16]] My favorite dish here. The scallops are oh so creamy, yet the bacon is oh so crispy. Topped with some tabasco aioli, this is the perfect appetizer in my opinion.[[Smoked Onion-Blue Cheese Dip, $9]] We were surprised when this dish came out, because we were given a hearty portion of the dip. The dip is served alongside some sliced toasted baguette. The smoked onion AND the blue cheese flavors were definitely noticeable, something I thought wasn't going to happen since both flavors are very strong on its own. [[Pappardelle Pasta, $16 - Add Chicken, $6]] I ordered this pasta dish, and thought it was alright, mostly because I'm a saucy kinda gal -- I love my pastas drenched in sauce, whether it be white or red sauce. I'm glad I got chicken too, because it added an extra layer of flavor to the already somewhat bland dish. [[Succulent Bacon Burger, $17]] My boyfriend ordered this dish and he loved it. The bacon was nice and crispy, the burger was cooked to what he ordered (medium). Overall, delicious. I took a bite of it too and wished I had ordered it![[Chocolate Cake]] If I remember correctly, it was a flourless cake? I totally forgot, something along those lines. But the cake was served alongside some vanilla ice cream, and it was a match made in food heaven. Delicious! Service here is great, as our server was attentive and helpful.I would definitely go back here, if I ever find myself in Solvang again. I would also want to try out their breakfast and lunch menu as well!There is both indoor and outdoor seating. If it gets a tad chilly, there are heaters for those sitting outdoors.Highly recommend!",4 star rating,Michelle T.
5/1/2019,"Derry, NH","Wife and I went here for an anniversary dinner and it was nothing less than amazing. My first impression as we walked up to the place was ""huh... This does seem more like a quick cafe than a place for a romantic dinner"" but as soon as we came in and were seated by a prompt and courteous staff I know we were in the right place.Our waitress was fluent with all the dishes and their ingredients and helped us make good dinner decisions. Little biscuits and fresh jam were brought out right away which was appreciated since it had been several sightseeing hours earlier since we last ate.The food was so delicious. I had the three little pigs and it was so tender, juicy and tasty. Wife had spicy hen and was equally impressed. I thought the portions were a bit small at first, but the were actually more than enough.Bonus, since it was our anniversary they brought us out two glasses of bubbly to help celebrate.

No fancy aiolis, micro greens, or heirloom anything needed. Just an insanely good burger.",5 star rating,Patricia G.

There was a line out the door (to be expected) and waited for about 10 minutes before we ordered.  If you have a big party (more than 5 people) I recommend having one person find seats as the restaurant is ""order up front, take a table number sign, and seat yourself"" style. There were options to sit inside and outside. Great family friendly atmosphere with high energy staff. The food came within 20 minutes and was gone within 10 :)Definitely recommend for any occasion with anyone!!",5 star rating,Rachel S.
2/1/2020,"Solvang, CA",Good food but disappointed in the service last night. To be honest my husband and I have been here several times and had great service. It would have been nice to have enjoyed a drink before our meal but it all came out together I asked for a cream brûlée ahead of time which she brought out and said she would bring back a desert menu so the rest of us could look at but instead brought our check and said thank you so I assumed were done here. After we left we went down the street to Fitzpatrick's Tavern and ordered desert and I'm glad we did cause they had an amazing mud pie desert and Irish bread pudding.,3 star rating,Tina A.
6/15/2014,"San Diego, CA","Diabolically good sandwiches...for a price. Solvang was busy on the sunny summer Saturday, and street parking was a bit tight. Once inside, order at the counter and they bring it out to you.Had the fried artichoke and mozzarella sandwich which, at $10.95, was one of the most expensive in recent memory, especially since it included no sides. The sandwich was large, nicely presented, and was dressed with pesto and arugula...yum! Artichokes were perfectly fried. Decided to add a side of their amazing home-made potato salad. It was a bargain at 95 cents, and made with bacon, eggs, mustard and mayo. Perhaps the best ever. $2.75 iced tea was also top dollar, but flavorful. Wife's pastrami had sliced fennel and looked good. Total for two sandwiches, two sides and one tea was $30 and change. Seems high for the location, but the strong Solvang tourist traffic must bear it?Nice seating areas inside and out.",4 star rating,Charles H.

It was a great decision because the food we ordered was great. The biscuits were especially delicious. I would highly recommend ordering them. I ordered the French toast, which was also extremely good. When you walk in, you initially line up at the counter and order your food. After ordering, they give you a number, which you carry over to the connecting room. Then, a waiter brings your food over to you. I would definitely come again!",5 star rating,Jasmine N.

We were very glad to find Succulent Cafe and their wonderful selection of meats and cheeses. Everything tasted wonderful and the setting of the cafe was relaxing and fun. The only negative I would mention is that the staff was not entirely welcoming, as many of them stood idly by the front entrance and did not seem eager to greet us with any excitement as we walked in. It seemed like they weren't kept too busy, but we were very happy with the service we received and would definitely return for the fun ambience and delicious food.

I had the bacon-wrapped scallops appetizer and the beet salad. My dining companions had the soup of the day (broccoli-cheese) and the chef's vegan special, which for this evening was vegan chili. The food was delicious and the ambiance was pleasant, not too loud or crowded. Portions were reasonable. The prices are in line with what one would expect for quality, fresh, well-prepared, innovative food in a tourist town. One drawback is there is one, unisex bathroom which I always find inconvenient.

We all ordered different things: the burger, chicken sandwich, and pastrami sandwich. The burger won hands down. So juicy and the flavors were amazing!

However they do have wine by the glass or bottle.The ""fish"" on my salad was actually a round patty of minced and then fried fish and spices, presumably intended for a fish burger. However it contained about ten times the amount of salt that would have rendered it edible, so this was not successful. My companions' tuna melt and ham sandwich were better.The outside seating area is pleasant, and set back far enough from the main highway to create a nice oasis in busy Solvang.",3 star rating,Steve A.

Because you know, you need your veggies.Both were full of flavor and waitress was super nice to check in on us a few times. No wait too but I came on a Thursday night.

2/26/2014,"Buena Park, CA","I really wanted to come here for the dinner menu but it wasn't open on the night we were staying in Solvang so had to settle for the lunch menu.  The obvious choice for me was the Succulent Bacon Burger because they make their own bacon, and this is a place that specializes in cured meat.  It's a pretty basic looking burger with house bacon, tomato, lettuce, red onion, and house spread on the side.  I'm glad they give the spread on the side because this is a burger where you just want to taste the meat.  There was enough smoky flavor from the bacon so you really didn't need anything else.  Even the burger tasted like it had some bacon pieces or some cured meat in it because the flavor was well distributed in the patty.  I used the house spread to dip my fries, which came with the burger.  The house spread tasted like a combination of tartar sauce and thousand island dressing.  My wife got the buttermilk fried chicken salad but I wasn't too impressed with this dish.  The salad part was ok but the chicken was too thin and rather tough. It almost looked like they were trying to make the chicken pieces look like bacon. They were flat and cut into long strips.  I was hoping it would be more like the fried chicken salad at Tender Greens but was not even close.  I should've known better than to order a chicken dish at a place that specializes in charcuterie.  I would like to come back and try the meatloaf on the dinner menu next time.  Can't go wrong with bacon gravy and house made bacon on a meatloaf.",4 star rating,Les S.

2/18/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was a tasty spot for breakfast. We came on a Sunday and got in right before a big rush. We had our dogs with us so we took a seat on the patio. For brunch, they have you line up and order food and then find a seat after, which I hate because what if you get your food and there are no seats available.. then you have to stand around and wait for someone to leave. Having our pups with us, we could only sit on the patio so I grabbed a table and held the fort while my husband ordered, so that worked out.  I had a BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) and he had a patty melt, both with fries. The food was very yummy!!! The fries are super good here.. and the coffee is delicious too. One star down because my husbands coffee cup still had someone's lipstick on it.. gross. We didn't notice until after he got coffee in it so we just wiped it down. I get it, it gets busy, but washing dishes efficiently after each customer is key. Luckily he's not a germaphobe so we moved past it quickly.   Everything else was great! Patio was cute and fun to sit on, the servers were super friendly and nice, one even brought us some water for the pups!

They were getting ready for a party when my wife and I walked up to try their happy hour. Everything sounds great and delicious, the presentation is awesome and the drinks and service is good. I'd love to see this place at night, I look at the pictures and it looks awesome. Some things that I really wanted to see, but they don't do are homemade charcuteries and home made cheeses...you would figure that a place with ""charcuterie"" in the name they would make it all in house. They do, however, advertise home made jams though. I would like to walk around their kitchen to see what they have making, and maybe share with them the benefits of creating everything in house. OR if they advertised that they use meats from local artisan creators - that would be cool, as if they ""curated"" the meats for their restaurant. Just some suggestions.

To start, while ordering I asked a few questions about the food and the high schoolers working behind the counter looked at me like I was an alien, although I was asking pretty typical questions. After my food was ready, I was having difficulties carrying all the food by myself to the table. Instead of offering to assist me, the employees just stared at me. Finally, I said I would need to leave a few things and come back for them. You'd think at this point the employees would have offered to assist, but nope.

10/3/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Stopped at Solvang for lunch as we were on the way to Hearst Castle. This restaurant has a great atmosphere and wonderful space for outdoors dining. If it wasn't for the heatwave that had temps exceeding 100 degrees that day, my party and I probably wouldn't have minded having our meal outside. However, the inside was a perfect hide away from the blazing sun with the dining room of the restaurant having an old tavern feel to it which was quite relaxing after having been on the road for few hours. They have a great selection of sandwiches that all sound quite tasty but we settled with the grilled vegetable sandwich and curried chicken sandwich. Everyone was pleased and with each person only eating half of a sandwich, it was more than enough food before needing to get back on the road. The only thing I would recommend against getting is the ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice which costs $4 for a glass. My wife insisted on getting it even though they told me that they didn't squeeze the juice themselves. In other words, if I wanted to go to Whole Foods and spend $6 I could buy myself way more than I'd be getting with the glass serving. Plus the juice didn't even taste like it was fresh squeezed.",4 star rating,Rich O.

Kids ordered breakfast and I opted for the Eggs Benedict. Very very delicious! Large portions, lots of flavor and the biscuits were buttery and good. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars. Prices seemed kinda pricey. Paid $75+ for 3 lunch meals and 1 breakfast meal and 2 lemonades. For a counter order service place...too expensive in my books.",4 star rating,Susie F.

4/2/2016,"Long Beach, CA","Stopped here between wine tastings. My wife and I needed to refuel and put something non-alcoholic in our stomaches. Cute establishment, with a good looking bar. We came in around 3:30 so they were doing a happy hour and charcuterie menu, which was perfect for us. We ordered the two meat and two cheese charcuterie, $22. Not cheap, but not outrageous. The food was served on a wooden platter shaped like a pig (adorable), and was very tasty. It's chef's choice in terms of meats and cheeses, so you roll the dice, but they did right by us. We ended up with a truffled soppressata and a prosciutto, along with a mustard seed English cheddar and a port wine-infused cheddar. All four were delicious. The platter was a bit busy, with tons of other foods on there, but it is hard to complain about too much food. Other tasty treats included (but were not limited to) house made jam and mustard, spiced cashews, pickles, dried cranberries and figs. Service was a bit slow, but our server was very pleasant and helpful. The speed was understandable considering she was the only one working at the time. All said, this is the perfect spot to rest and refuel if you are hitting the local wine or beer tasting rooms. We will be back!",4 star rating,Bill M.
11/9/2015,,"A dash of high class in sleepy Solvang!When you first enter Succulent you're greeted by a pretty simple facility that has both outdoor and indoor dining.  It's pretty cozy and not 'over the top' fancy.  The building only has two uni-sex restrooms which proved to be inconvenient as there was usually someone standing outside each of them waiting.  Pretty tacky for a place with these price points.  Overall, I'd give the establishment 4 stars, but barely.The service was 3-4 stars.  For $40-50 per person I usually receive better.  Wasn't terrible, but our waitress could have been a bit friendlier and have a bit less attitude.Where Succulent really thrives is where it matters:  the FOOD!  Wow.. everything was fantastic.  We started off with a cheese tray that was to die for.  I then got the ""3 Little Pigs"" dish which was an easy 5 stars.  My wife got the steak with grits and both were fantastic.  Even the side dish of Mac'n'Cheese was incredible.  The chef at this place really knows what she's doing (we were told it was a female).  The Creme Brulee desert was the best we've ever had on the West coast.  Amazing!  5 stars for the food.I debated whether to give Succulent 4 stars for the mediocre facility with 2 full bathrooms or the waitress who must have had a long day before we arrived.  However, the food was just far too good to give it anything less than 5 stars.5 stars!",5 star rating,Jason L.

The pulled pork sandwich is very tasty along with theirs salads. Any sandwich can be made into salads, if you're into that. Try their wines, you'll find a good selection.

We were not disappointed! We ordered the fried chicken, biscuit, & gravy,  the 2+2 charcuterie, spicy chicken salad, and kids' tenders. The food was excellent and so refreshing. The service and ambiance were as great! But,  what left us most impressed and grateful... My son had left his iPad on one of the tables. He has ASD and his iPad is literally his best friend! We didn't realize he didn't have it until much later and were already in Santa Barbara. We tried calling but there was no answer, maybe closed between lunch and dinner service. Knowing the chances were slim, we decided to take a chance and returned back anyways. We were beyond happy when they had kept it safe for him! There were happy tears now!",5 star rating,Lori M.

We arrived here around noon on a busy Sunday with 2 hungry kids in tow. We noticed they had outdoor seating so we thought it would be good to stop here. The gentleman at the front was SO kind to us and let us know upfront that the kitchen was backed up from being so busy and the food was about a 40 minute wait. With the kids being so hungry we decided not to stay and try to find something a little faster. This sweet man totally went out of his way to give us recommendations to a closer restaurant with good food and a faster kitchen time.

Glad I did! Nothing better than a grilled sourdough sandwich. It paired nicely with Riesling wine. The sandwich came with fries and was enough to share and each person to leave comfortably full without feeling ""stuffed"".It did take about 10-15 minutes to receive our order well worth the small wait time.

12/3/2017,"Downey, CA","Less than impressed with this place.  Came in yesterday during HH and walked in to a nearly empty restaurant. (3 servers, 2 patrons at 1 table) For starters, servers told me they could only serve the items on the happy hour menu and nothing more. My boyfriend and I were looking for a meal not finger food. Decided to give this place a shot anyway. We ordered the pork sliders and a charcuterie plate. The charcuterie plate was probably a 2/5. One of the meats tasted bad. It ended up giving me a stomach ache later. The cherry on top was the inattentive staff. Took forever to get our bill, pick up our bill, never got water refills and the 3 were just sitting amongst one another at the bar talking. Definitely won't come back.",1 star rating,Liz C.

11/19/2015,"Denver, CO","This is a review where I have to thank my yelpers out there because without you I wouldn't have found this amazing gem. Although only 2 dishes were ordered there are not enough praises I can give this supper cute place.  I mean the places logo is a pig so how could you not like it? Me and the bf dropped in during our 35hrs in Solvang and boy are we glad we did. Heres why... Ambiance: We came in around 7pm on a Sunday night and were welcomely greeted by the staff and cozy atmosphere. Although the outside patio was cute and lit up with lights it was a bit too cold and windy to enjoy it so we sat at the bar. I loved the décor and basket of blankets at the front incase you needed them. You will feel right at home here! Total score: 5/5Service: When there is a bar to sit at that is where I usually prefer to eat my meals.  I love talking to the staff and seeing the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. I was glad I did here as the bartender that night Nelida was such a charm.  She made us feel so welcomed and gave us some great tips on what to do while in town. On top of that, service was very fast.. However that wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't as this is the kind of place you want to hang at and take your time. Total score: 5/5Price: Prices here for great and right on point, not overpriced and not underpriced. Don't get me wrong you are not going to get a meal under $10 but this is not that kind of place...trust me all worth it. Total score: 5/5What was ordered:Wine: I forgot what I ordered but loved that Nelida brought me over a sample before I made my selection (note: the sample was HUGE!)Biscuits & house made jam: FREE yes these amazing balls of heaven are free and you get them when you sit down.  What a great alternative to bread and butter. Did I mention FREE?!?! Oh yea.. And they are amazing. Charcuterie & Cheese 3 X 3 $33: (*Note these are crafted depending on what the chef orders that day or buys from the local farmers market) On this particular night boy were we spoiled as our HUGE spread came with smoked duck prosciutto, ham prosciutto, beef prosciutto, an amazing French brie, Bermuda triangle cheese, walnut date cheddar.  Now if that was not enough this spread was accompanied with house made jam, fruits, olives, house made jam, fruits, olives, crostini & crackers. I am so glad we ordered this first before we decided if we needed entrées as this thing is an entrée and will certainly fill up 2-3 people. PEOPLE YOU MUST GET THIS!!! So sensational. Bacon sundae $8: salted Carmel McConell's Ice cream turned with candied bacon and a pecan bar drizzled with carmel and 3 pieces of candied bacon. WOW. that's all just WOW. Perfect sweet, salty, and savory mix that melts right in your mouth. Do yourself a favor and make it to Succulent if you are in the area it will not disappoint. We can't wait to be back for a real dinner cosseting of more than wine, cheese, and bacon ice cream : ) Thank you Nelida for the great hospitality!",5 star rating,Ashley O.
5/28/2014,"Oakland, CA","Stumbled upon this place after noticing that the restaurant I wanted to eat at had over 20 people standing outside waiting. Walked a few spots over and here I was.There was also a line to order, but not nearly as long. I was with 2 other friends so we tagged team. We arrived around 10am. They waited in line while I scouted a table outside.The food took about 30 minutes to arrive, but with good company, time flies. I ordered ""The Ella"" and it was worth the wait. The spinach was cooked just right. My favorite part would have to be the poached egg on top. Once I took a bite, the yolk smothered the sandwich, in a flavorful way. An order of the cinnamon sugar donut holes was also ordered. These were tasty as I dipped each into warm not-too-sweet chocolate sauce, similar texture to creamy Nuttella. My mouth just watered as I typed this. I will definitely be back in the future! Just note that you shouldn't be in a hurry to eat here since it takes some time to order and get your food.",4 star rating,Jean L.

In terms of drinks my friend ordered an apple cinnamon mimosa and I ordered a class of Pinot. We were staying close by at an inn and this was so convenient as we walked along on our first night here.

Stopped by for breakfast and ordered the short rib hash with poached eggs and the blueberry lemonade to drink. The food was excellent! Tender pieces of beef scattered between well-seasoned potatoes and bell peppers with perfectly poached eggs with warm yolks that smothered everything. The sweet-tart lemonade was a great choice to accompany my meal. Since I went with friends, I was picking of their plates to get a taste of the other options I didn't taste and among them was: the French toast and other eggs dishes like the omelette and eggs with biscuits. All delicious! This place has definitely given competition to my usual spot and I will be making more frequent appearances here.",4 star rating,Jonnathan B.

The bean soup was just okay, nothing special - no soup spoon. Ribs were okay, nothing special. The waitress described them as ""falling off the bone"" - nope. Also, no wet cloth to clean your hands with after eating the ribs. For the rest of the meal I was all sticky. Side dishes were mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, also fine but nothing special.  Coffee and creme brulee were good. The service was fine.

The Succulent Biscuit sounded very interesting on the menu but it was a bit too small to fill my dad up haha. My mom got the vanilla bourbon french toast and that was amazingly soft even though they make the toast using French baguette-looking slices!

My family got the hot dog kids meal, the hen plate, and the mac and cheese kids meal. The kebabs were good, the rice was bleh.

We chose to sit outside since we had our dog with us and the weather was nice. They are a pet friendly restaurant which was nice.2. Service- when we first walked up we were a little unsure if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated, we walked to the back of the cafe and the girl at the register invited us in. She gave us menus and took our orders. The staff was nice and friendly. When we got our food they came back several times to check in on us. 3. Food- the food is what makes this a 3 stars, We both ordered the breakfast platter which included eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit (for 11 dollars) and you can add bacon or sausage for 3 dollars more, so we did. Our food came, fresh and hot. The only thing about the potatoes they were cut so big that they didn't fully cooked, I don't mind my potatoes cut big as long as they are soft when I bite until them. One positive about the potatoes they did come with bell peppers and onions. My bacon was crispy just how I love it. The biscuit was so delicious, crispy and buttery.",3 star rating,Jacky M.

The size was perfect for the two of us to share. A little pricey ($33) but you definitely get what you pay for. The chef picks what cheeses and meats you get to have but if there is something you don't care for you can let them know beforehand and they'll leave it out.

If you don't eat pork, beef, or lamb, entree options are limited. I think there is a chicken entree, and a fish of the day. Everything was prepared very well.

8/20/2017,"Norwalk, CA","Super busy on a Saturday morning.  Located within close proximity to Olsen's Bakery and Paula's Pancake House, this is busy street.  This is a place where you order at the counter and then find a table either on the patio or the dining room.  They drop off your food at your table, and there are water stations where you go to get your own water and condiments.I will say that the biscuit is very good here.  The bacon they serve is thick cut and cooked really well.  The house made sausage is great, but has a strong fennel flavor.  They know how to poach a decent egg.  But the gravy here falls quite short.  It tastes like a sweetened roux...it doesn't taste like bacon unless you have a bacon bit in your bite.  It's a tad on the sweet side, but really tastes like uncooked flour.  We had to jazz it up with hot sauce and A1 sauce to make it palatable. The BLTA and fries was the most successful dish we tried.",3 star rating,Tovan T.
5/26/2018,"Orange, CA","We wanted to go to Paula's because everyone rants and raves about it online. When we got there, the wait was so long and it was so crowded I felt like I was at Disneyland. So we decided to give Succulent a shot bc the patio was cute and it wasn't overwhelming with herds of people. The food was great and the tables outside were so cute! We were pleasantly surprised and are happy we came here. A much more calm and enjoyable experience. I recommend the French toast!",5 star rating,G G.
7/3/2015,"Burbank, CA","This place was so nice, we came here twice! Solvang isn't exactly known for good food (let's face it, if you're here, it's probably for a different reason, and I can probably guess what it is) but this is a stellar exception, and one of the best restaurants in the town, by far. We came here for dinner for a pre-bachelorette weekend. The cheese/charcuterie board was incredible. And the bacon-wrapped scallops were the best I've had in my life! We enjoyed the food so much that when we came back the next morning, there wasn't any question of where to go.Unfortunately, they don't serve breakfast on the weekdays, so we went with the lunch menu. I ordered an amazing Bloody Mary with bacon (if a server says, would you like bacon in that, is there more than one answer?) and the fried artichoke and mozzarella sandwich. I ordered it because it sounded unique, but I really loved it. I'm writing this review several weeks after our trip and still remember vividly how delicious it was.I wish Succulent would open locations in LA! One of the highlights of our Solvang trip.",5 star rating,Bridget P.

2/17/2014,"Austin, TX","Based off of the cute decor and the quaint vibe, I would definitely label this as a great spot for brunch.Over winter break, a few friends and I road tripped to Solvang for a day and stopped here for lunch. The weather was wonderful, so it was a perfect day to sit outside (they have ample tables, chairs, & umbrellas).Parking is a bit of a struggle, but we found street parking near the Solvang town square and walked over.The food/sandwiches are a bit pricey, but the portions are large (we all have trouble finishing our food). AND THE TATER TOTS. SO GOLDEN AND SO PERFECT. I highly recommend them. I personally ordered the PBT sandwich (pancetta, basil, & heirloom tomato), which was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise absolutely wonderful. The rest of my bros were similarly pleased with their food.",4 star rating,Olivia H.

9/14/2015,"Alhambra, CA","I came to Succulent for brunch and started out excited, but as I waited in line for about 20 minutes the excitement dissipated. I felt horrible for the woman taking everyone's orders because it seemed like she was doing a little bit of everything while a couple of bussers were standing on the side not doing anything. By the time we got to the front they had run out of numbers to give us and she was frantically asking someone to help and get one for her - no one could find one and she resorted to writing our number on a paper cup which caused a bit of confusion when delivering our order.The Ella - poached egg, braised spinach, tomato jam on a biscuit.  $8.50I messed up. The Ella sounded delightful, but it was lacking a lot of salt or cheese or something to tie it together. The biscuit felt like it was very undercooked, but then I just assumed that was maybe their style. I had to keep reaching over to my bf's plate to grab some of his gravy to put on top.Fried Chicken & Gravy Biscuit - buttermilk fried chicken, aged cheddar and bacon gravy. $10.50This was very flavorful! The gravy was perfect for my taste, not too heavy or greasy with just the right amount of salty goodness. The picture we saw portrayed this dish with two pieces of bacon and we only got one, but the one piece was so delicious it almost made up for the fact that we felt like we were being ripped off.One dish was good, one dish was super boring, coffee was fine, there was a long line and flies that kept trying to land on our food inside = 3 stars",3 star rating,Courtney O.
3/7/2016,"San Ramon, CA","Walked in about 8ish and they were actually going to close early because it was a slow night.  But they were gracious and kind and let me stay which I really appreciated.  Staff - bartender and server were both very nice and helpful in picking out a nice glass of wine. Ordered the daily soup - creamy of carrot which was creamy yumminess.  They give you complimentary homemade little buttermilk biscuits - warm with a berry jam.  It was delish. For my entree I ordered the beet salad and asked for romaine in place of mixed greens and ordered grilled shrimp with it. It looked nice but wasn't as delish as I had hoped. The romaine seemed a droopy and not as fresh as i would have hoped for this place.  Maybe it was because of the grilled shrimp but I think it would have at least started out crispy. The grilled shrimp was ok, (didn't see any grill marks?) and I'm glad I ordered it because just the salad would have left a little to be desired without something extra. Definitely would like to try the angus burger another time - just wasn't super hungry. The atmosphere is nice. Modern feel, woodsy and wine racks on the wall. It was extremely quiet when I was there but probably mostly because it was just me and then another couple came in shortly after.  Worth a try for sure when you're in the area!!",4 star rating,Jeannette L.
8/21/2015,"Diamond Bar, CA","I have no idea why and how I got here -- a really random city in the middle of nowhere. I stopped by here with my boyfriend and his parents as we made an alternative trip home along the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to Los Angeles. And it's a really cute, small town with small boutiques, candy/food shops, and dainty motels/lodges.We came along this restaurant, located next to a windmill, and made it just before the closed the doors for lunch. I ordered a Smoked BBQ Meatloaf that sounded bomb on the menu, but I grew sick of it as I continuously took bites out of it. It could really use a few leaves of arugula or some type of veggie.",3 star rating,Jacqueline K.
6/29/2015,"Redondo Beach, CA","We came here yesterday based on yelp reviews.  I love the town of Solvang but have never been able to stop and have lunch in the area.We were lucky to immediately find a table outside.  Unfortunately the only table that was open was in the sun.  My friend and I sat outside while the rest of our party waited in line to order... it probably took them almost 20 mins before they ordered and they were told it would be another 20 minutes before the food came out.... ah man!!!  Another table ended up leaving in the shade so we swooped in and grabbed it.  It was awesome that they were so quick to come clean the table!  Our food came out around the time frame they gave us.I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich. I added caramelized onions.  It was amazing, with so much flavor!!! I loved how the onions and portabello were hot and balsamic-y and it was topped with fresh and crunchy spinach all served on a doughy soft ciabatta roll.  The hubby got the succulent bacon burger with avocado.  He said it was bomb and that the bacon was ""where it was at!"" I loved the patio the most, great ambiance with the market lights and the large windmill next door.  I wish it didn't take so long to get food.. but hanging out on the patio means it wasn't the worst wait for food.I definitely recommend to stop here if you are passing through or staying the weekend.  The husband and I are already looking into a weekend when we can come and spend some more time in this adorable town.",4 star rating,Kristin H.

7/9/2015,"Ontario, CA","We really enjoyed eating dinner here, but first a tip ""make a dinner reservation"". You will thank me later. Been to Solvang a few times but my wife and I have never stopped here for dinner. So glad we did, we made a last minute reservation for dinner. We sat inside inside and I don't know where to start. The ambiance is so calm and so relaxing, I recommend to order an 805 and start with the Confit of Artichokes and Feta (spread). I am not sure about which wine to choose or pair with your meal since I am more of a cerveza kind of guy.Then after you've sat back and enjoyed your drink and spread, order the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (my wife orderd this) and the Three Little Pigs (this is what I ordered). They are both delicious, however for me the Three Little Pigs was perfect. They sit on top some potatoes and some greens, then of course the bacon wrapped pork. Mouth watering, the service was great, very clean and I will certainly come back.",5 star rating,Pedro F.
9/3/2015,"San Diego, CA","""Reservation recommended for this excellent restaurant""We agree with the fine reviews and found Succulent Cafe to be a real treat. The menu is a little eclectic but fitting for the location. My wife had a Firestone Walker draft beer and I enjoyed a ""bloody mary"" with two strips of bacon added for garnish. Note that the art work for the Succulent Cafe is a pig and they take every opportunity to add pork products to their menu. Yes, they do have some succulent plants but that is really not the emphasis. The evening special included a veggie everything thin crust pizza that was just right for sharing. And I had their version of a Caesar salad, unique and great.",4 star rating,Walker S.
11/7/2017,"Los Angeles, CA",Stopped here for a quick bite and overall was pretty impressed. Food was good! Lots of room to sit which is not what I initially expected upon walking in. The only reason for the 4 stars is I feel like it was a place that could have afforded to seat you and take your order. Instead you get in line and order at the counter and the food is brought to you. There's nothing wrong with that - it's just preference I suppose.Price point was a little high as well. Would have loved to try their charcuterie plates but for 2 meats and 2 cheeses it was $22! A little steep for something that is likely to still leave me hungry (per other reviews),4 star rating,Lynn H.

They said they stop serving lunch at 3 and we are only allowed to order a very small happy hour menu. I explained to her that it just turned 3 and it would be so helpful to me if she would serve us lunch and wouldn't make me drag two handicap woman across the street again.

I had ordered this before, and loved it so much had to stop in again for a box to take with us for the day. When we had this box previously, just to give you an idea, it was split between 4 adults and there were leftovers. This time the portion was half the amount and loaded with everything BUT meat and cheese. From the photo you can tell the whole box contained less than 3oz of meat and cheese. The to-go box doesn't work, pickled everything after carrying in a bag a short distance. Last time only a few pickled pieces, so wasn't an issue. Since the box was comprised of primarily pickled items this time it was gross all jumbled up. Can you tell I wasn't into the pickles?$33 for the 3+3 box in the photo.",2 star rating,Kiki M.

There was ample seating.  There was a small 10 min line.  Food came out reasonably quick.  There were 2 bathrooms, but I didn't know about the hallway one until after about 15 min of futilely waiting for the person to come out of the one in the main dining area.

Umbrellas block the bright sun. Indoor seating, as well but we sat in the nice 71 degree January weather. I had the pastrami and fries. $15 gets you a good helping of pastrami well made and tasty. The sea salt fries - awesome. My lemonade was both sweet and tart. Awesome. The chicken and salad is great if you like the romaine. My daughter didn't so I ate most of it. She ate all the tasty chicken however. The pepitas added a nice touch. The tuna sandwich is a funny thing. My future daughter in law had it but her taste is different. She enjoyed it but only ate half. Her issue is personal taste but it was well made and lots of tasty tuna IMHO. The pasole was very well made with a spicy bite in the finish. Delicious. The pulled pork was tasty but my daughter would like less sweetness (pineapple). My wife had the BLTA without the A. Perfect but she would love more bacon! Just her taste, of course.

I requested the country fried steak and gravy and the biscuit was still undercooked, but the gravy made it edible. 4. The wait.

The chesese were a blue goat cheese and another hard cheese. Meats were a duck prosciutto and a salami. I wish there were more crostini's on our plate. I ordered the duck confit, which wasn't really on my plate. There were only a few pieces of the confit and mostly duck breast but it was good nonetheless. The 3 little pigs was more delightful.

The space itself is well designed trendy, nice place for a date, and bit fancy. It can accommodate large parties but space for large groups would be limited. I do love sitting outside when the air is warm because its such a lovely ambiance. Last time I was there I had the Catch of the day with double veggies. The fish was a Sea Bass and was cooked perfectly my disappointment came when the veggies were bland and simply just sautéed zucchini in way to much oil. Something I myself could have done at home and for $30.00 for the plate I was hoping for more. I did treat myself to a Bacon Sundae at the end. This took forever to come out. As we waited wondering if it would be worth it... it was. The Sundae was amazing. There was no way I would have been able to finish it my self but the salted Carmel ice cream makes the dish.

The weather was especially warm during Labor Day weekend, but I could totally imagine sitting outside after the sun sets. The cafe sits right next to a large windmill, and they have cute lights strung across their patio. The charcuterie board was intense.

2/10/2017,"Burbank, CA","Late afternoon on the road back home after a weekend away, getting a little peckish.  Stop in touristy Solvang for an early dinner, ended up at Succulent Cafe around 4p.  We're an hour early for dinner, hey, that's fine, we'll sit on the patio and enjoy a beverage and charcuterie/cheese (3+3 @ $33).Moved on to dinner:  3 Little Pigs ($29) for the spouse, meatloaf ($24) for me.  Everything about 3 Little Pigs is standout-perfect, meatloaf not so much.  Meatloaf is mushy, but buttermilk mash is terrific.For these prices (even @ Solvang standards), service should be top-notch and everything should taste awesome.  Sadly, that was not our experience.  Nice selection on menu with gluten-free and vegan options available.",3 star rating,Lisa R.
12/22/2018,"Wilmington, CA","I've had better service at Dick's Last Resort (a restaurant that intentionally gives comically bad service as part of its gimmick).We arrived at our reservation time of 8pm. We were seated in a couple minutes, and then proceeded to wait 25 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence again. We immediately placed our order for appetizers and drinks. It is 9:07 as I write this, our original server is still nowhere to be seen, and they've brought us one of the three appetizers we ordered, and another server just came over to warn us that they've closed the kitchen so we can't order anything else. We're still waiting on the other two appetizers.No one has come to explain the delay to us or apologize. The only time our existence was acknowledged was when a server asked us if we wanted more bread and water.Because we are a party of six, the restaurant is automatically giving our server a 20% tip.The one food item we've actually received is tasty, at least, but I still wish I could give this place a rating of less than one star.Update: 9:14, we just received our second item from a new server. She seemed unaware of the third item we ordered. Maybe it's still coming? Who knows, it's a mystery.Update: 9:22 our final item was still missing, when I noticed another table say ""we didn't order that"" to an item another server (mystery server #3) put on their table. It was the thing we had ordered. I pointed this out and server #3 brought it over to us. So an hour and 22 minutes after we got here, we finally have our APPETIZERS! Amazing!Update 9:33: got our check. They took the one bottle of wine we ordered off. Server tells us our original server was light-headed and had to leave for the hospital and apologized. I still don't know why they didn't tell us anytime sooner in the past hour and a half that our server had to leave and they're accommodating the situation as best as they can. I feel bad for the server, but whoever the manager is needs to buy a clue.Updating the stars to 3 and calling this a mulligan on their part, I guess.",3 star rating,Michael H.

7/20/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm in Solvang for my birthday vacation and we didn't arrive until 7pm which for this little town is very late. Most places close about as soon as the sun goes down 6-8pm or so. But I hadn't eaten all day so the hunt was on! I didn't want to go to the same Ol fast food joints I can have that anytime anywhere. So I found this place on yelp almost literally across the street from our hotel. It was open til 9pm so I had just enough time to freshen up and go.Upon arriving we walk into the cutest courtyard for outdoor seating! There are plants everywhere and lights strung across the patio I don't know why anyone would bother sitting inside (unless it's raining). The inside is quite the opposite very minimal nothing really pleasing to the eye.Now for the Food!I Came here with hopes that I'd get to have the BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN SALAD. But to my dismay they only serve that for lunch. So I opt for the BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN ENTREE which comes with a queso MAC N CHEESE that if you asked me tasted like Mac noodles in tostinos queso dip. It's alright but I wasn't all that into it and I'm a girl who loves me some Mac! It also comes with GREENS which were pretty good I have no complaints. However, for the FRIED CHICKEN itself I was very disappointed the breast was lacking majorly in the flavor department and it's not tender at all. I sometimes find that a breast is pretty bland because it's such a large piece of lean white meat but to counter that a thoroughly seasoned breading/crust does wonders BUT NO I don't even think they bothered to put even a sprinkle of salt in the flour. My boyfriend had the SHORT RIBS. Which came with BRUSSELS SPROUTS and GRITS but he substituted that for MASHED POTATOES. I didn't try much of his food but a bite of the short ribs and they're good but not great they're tender but dry and the biggest flavor I got was the wine. I've had much better for cheaper. Now I kinda wish I went to the drive through...",2 star rating,brittney c.

My goodness, it's the epitome of delicious. You must have a Charcuterie board, I mean it, even if you order nothing else--you must have a board! You will send your taste buds on a journey as you nibble on pickled vegetables, homemade jams, exceptional cured meats, nuts and more. The arrangement is really a piece of art--intricate but abstract. And of course you'll need a perfectly paired glass of wine with that array of flavor. They offer the perfect amount of options on their menu and I cannot wait to go back and try more. Today I had the bourbon French toast with bacon. It was so delicious I nearly forgot to use my syrup.

If you haven't been here, it is well worth it for the food. This is a quirky place, where tourists and locals eat together. You walk thru the door, and order at the counter. Hopefully you have someone else in your party to hold a table, or you are stuck by the door, bar, etc. I ordered my eggs basted, which apparently they don't do????? Ok, the poached were good. Short rib hash? Fantastic. Bourbon French toast? Beyond yummy. You have to get your own coffee refills, which is ok, but you pour from a carafe, 1 CARAFE, and when it empties (for all 30 ppls. in your area) it good awhile to brew more....really? At 9:30 on a Sunday morning? Aside from my lack of caffeine, I would recommend this, though I felt for self serve, the overall $40+ bill was about $10 too much.",4 star rating,Brad O.

12/8/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","Succulent cafe is the absolute best place to eat when you are visiting Solvang.  I would recommend Brothers restaurant too, but it is a short drive north in Los Olivos.  Solvang is a touristy town with most restaurants all serve the same boring pancake, sausage, and waffle recipe.  If you don't want to be a sucker waiting in line for one of those tourist trap, I mean ""Danish"" restaurant, then head to Succulent cafe where you will be pleasantly surprised.  Succulent cafe is centrally located on Mission, but the food is atypical for the area.  The ingredients were high quality and sourced locally.  Everything was made from scratch, even the condiments, jams, pickles, bacon, and charcuterie were made in house.  It was obvious that the owner didn't take the easy way out by procuring ingredients from factories and churn out easy profits.   The meatloaf sandwich was made of several slices of thick bbq meatloaf over housemade cornbread, garnished with a crisp bacon strip and sweet tomato sauce.  The meatloaf had a nice texture, meaty, but not too dense.  The charcuteri hero and the pastrami were a little on the salty side, but the meat was high quality and balanced with tart pickles and cabbages.  The bread used for the hero was a rustic savory olive bread, substantial enough for the vinaigrette, but still light with slightly crusty edge.  Shortrib sandwich was tender with a nice cinnamon/fennel note served with refreshingly tart slaws.  We finished the meal with a nice butter cookie filled with the freshest tasting homemade apple jam.  The taste showcased the artisan approach to simple ingredients.   You can take a little bit of Succulent Cafe home with you by purchasing their bottled jams and pickles.",5 star rating,Lily Z.
10/31/2015,"San Francisco, CA","This place will make you squeal with delight! Succulent is far and away our favorite restaurant in the Solvang area, and when we were in Santa Maria for business this weekend, we rented a car and drove the thirty minutes to enjoy another fine meal here.  As always, the meal began with homemade mini biscuits and jam, then we split a bowl of awesome roasted brussels sprouts studded with crispy bacon bits and drizzled with balsamic vinegar glaze and dusted with flaky sea salt. I had the Three Little Pigs entree: bacon wrapped pork tenderloin medallions on top of crispy mashed potato cakes with braised greens and pork gravy. Other worldly! My husband had their meatloaf with buttermilk mashed potatoes and succotash, which was also delicious.  We were so full from these dishes that we didn't have room for one of their awesome looking desserts (see my photos of their current menus).The service was truly outstanding, our orders were delivered with perfect timing from the kitchen, our water glasses were always full, plates cleared quickly, etc. The restaurant's decor is a rustic chic: lots of wood finishes throughout, ambient lighting, nice temp, not too loud though still lively.  It's a perfect place for a date, casual dinner, or special occasion (as evidenced by the very sweet surprise engagement party a few tables over).We love Succulent and look forward to our next visit.",5 star rating,Amy M.
5/25/2018,"Thousand Oaks, CA","Absolutely wonderful meal. Made last minute reservations and glad we did as the restaurant got full shortly after we arrived at 6. My children ordered the truffle fries to start and my wife and I ordered the artichoke and feta spread. The fries won hands down. For mains we ordered the three little pigs, short ribs, beet salad, Caesar salad, scallops and shrimp. All was simply delicious. I found the mango chutney a little over powering to the shrimp but I was the only one who thought that. The waitress was on point and recommended a superb wine to complement our meal. We also finished off our meal sharing the bacon crumble sundae that was quickly devoured by all of us. I would rate the restaurant more than two dollar signs as our meal was just about $250 for four but was absolutely worth the money.

1/10/2015,"Whittier, CA","Small place, newer than most of the other places around town. You order at the front deli counter then sit at table and they bring your order. I really wanted to sit out on the patio however it was sprinkling outside so we choose a spot in the dining area. There's a large bar in the dining area and the whole place has a modern but cozy charm. Went with the charcuterie plate with 2 meats and 2 cheese for $22. It was definitely enough for two. We weren't asked which cheeses or meats we wanted so I don't know if there's even an option but I would have deferred to their good judgement anyway. Our plate had a Brie, a blu cheese, a wild boar sausage and a venison sausage. Also came with mustard, jelly, white raisins, cranberries, small pickles, pickled radish, pickled onion, cashews, Marcona almonds, dried apricots, olives, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. Plus little crackers... All for $22!!!  My boyfriend got the Firestone 805, a local brewery, and I opted for the Storm Sauvignon Blanc, also local, which I really enjoyed. Service was quick, with attentive refills of water that tasted like it had cucumbers in it!

We had the pulled pork sandwich which I would absolutely recommend. But when in California, get the cheese board. It's really hard to go wrong with cheese, but we were pleasantly surprised to see a variety of unique items like pickled vegetables, housemade mustard and a sweet pepper jam that was to die for!

There was other food but I can't get the French Toast out of my head because it was figuratively as big as my head, look at my profile picture I have a HUGE head. If you've been to Solvang you know there's food everywhere so I guess you have to work hard to stand out and this place did with the French Toast, I'm going to say it again French Toast. When it came out to the table and I saw it was made from what I assume was baguette type bread I thought well it will be tough on the outside maybe softer towards the middle but no! NO I SAY! It was soft and delicious... wait did I mention the butter? I have to talk about the butter. I like butter on my French Toast and this came with what can only be described as an ice cream sized scoop of butter, which I guess makes sense if the French Toast is as big as my head, but I digress. I'm pretty sure the butter had a hint of maple syrup to it too. You likely think I'm nuts now and it's not going to help my case that I absolutely cannot remember what else I ate but I know it was good, pretty sure I had orange juice which was good too.

2/27/2017,"Studio City, CA","Went here for dinner last weekend. Get reservations, it fills up quick. It is a nice spot, but we were not great fans of the food. Started with the brussel sprouts with bacon ($12), as they are a favorite (or atleast our waitress said so). Not much taste, and greasy. Bottle of Hitching Post Cork Dancer ($48). Always good. My wife got the special, Sea Bass, which was very good. The rice it came with was blah. I know it's just rise, but still. Vegies were swimming in butter. I had the meatloaf ($24). Not good. Again no taste. Very odd as well. Typically, meatloaf is a nice fat slice of juiciness. This was two thin pieces (each maybe 1/2"" thick) stacked, and dry. What is this? I am hoping they ran out of it, and had to cook some up real quick and this is the reason for the thin pieces. Never seen this before, and would never order it again.The service was very good.Probably wont be going back any time soon. There are other places for us to try.",3 star rating,Mr. B.

8/5/2014,"West Los Angeles, CA","Something was amiss. We're not used to requests going ignored. When you ask for something to be prepared the way you like it, it would be nice if that were what you got. That and my order was just lukewarm, when it really should have been hot. How do you send out half baked pizza? As in parts were not melted and kinda looked unappetizing. Salads were good.  Nothing to heat up there I guess. However, a slight gaff on the preparation as mentioned above. Some people are allergic, or at the very least, avoiding some ingredients.  Yeah, I know, I hate to be around those super picky types also, you know the ones who want to customize the hell out of everything.  So full disclosure, the request was, ""Cheese on the side, dressing on the side."" Not asking for the world IMHO. I can have cheese, plus one does not.What was served. Standard preparation of cheese and dressing on everything. Um Ok. If it was just that, would have just pushed the cheese to the side and grumble a bit about the dressing.  That and the half bakedness ? Nope. So, sometimes you send something back and your service staff get 'tude. There was some 'tude, man.  No bread basket, beverage refills take a LONG LONG Time... we're talking ask three times type of delay. Whatev's , like I said, hope it was just amiss.",2 star rating,Bill C.

On the first night I had the duck breast and confit and on the second, I had the fried chicken with mac n' cheese. Both dishes were amazing. The duck was fork tender. The confit... well, how can you go wrong with confit? Delicious. We also thoroughly enjoyed the almond leek goat cheese ""pot"" for an appetizer one night and a cheese board on the second occasion. Great service and a great wine list. We used to come here a couple years back when it was a wine bar, and while we miss that, this place is a breath of fresh air to the Solvang dining scene.

Only downside was with all the hard surfaces, one rambunctious group made it pretty noisy. We both had half a sandwich with a cup of soup. Both sandwiches (grilled cheese and turkey club) were excellent but the soup was out of this world good, a meal in itself with large chunks of (yes, I have to say it) succulent meat.

2/25/2015,"Seattle, WA","2.5 stars for our dinner experience.2 stars for my husband's bbq meatloaf dish -- thick mashed potatoes, bland and mealy meatloaf covered with a bland white gravy, and served with gratuitous bacon.3 stars for my fried chicken (if I ignore the slimy and watery brown ""greens"" on the plate).  Moist chicken and light, crispy coating.  Leave the overly sweet honey-mustard sauce behind and ask for honey and Sriracha and then drizzle both over the fried chicken (it would have been a 2 star dish without these add-ons).  The mac-n-cheese has nice texture, but is made with pretty heavily smoked cheese -- I added a touch of Sriracha to that too to tone down the smokiness.Very lean pour for my husband's $14 glass of Au Bon Climat.Service was friendly.  Atmosphere inside is fine, except that it is overly bright at night (there's  even a bare bulb blaring light in the ceiling, most of the spots could be aimed differently so as not to make diners feel like they're on a gameshow, and the lamp at the host stand was tilted (until I asked them to move it) in such as way as to shine directly toward our table and in my eyes).Outdoor seating looked nice and there are gas heaters.  There are also some pretty grody looking blankets available too -- I wouldn't use them; some are pilled and others looked dirty (even if they weren't).Have no plans to return to Solvang ... had no idea we were stopping in the middle of Lil' Denmark when I booked the hotel on a drive from San Francisco to Palm Springs ... had I known, we would have continued to Santa Barbara!",2 star rating,Dana R.

Marinated just right with the toasty brioche bun.The texture of the truffle mushrooms were so different from what I ever had. Not as chewy and similar to soft jerky.

Service: you don't have a waiter/waitress but the girls that took my order at the front desk were friendly and recommended my lunch dish for me. The food: the appearance of the food was beautiful; the best I have ever seen for sandwiches. I had a short rib sandwich and it looked AMAZING. Unfortunately the meat was very dry and since that was 90% of the sandwich, it made for a poor experience especially for a $13 sandwich. The pasta salad was very good, I just wish they gave you more than a little cup full. The service was great but unfortunately the food wasn't.",3 star rating,Michael R.

All the tasty adjectives in the world just wouldn't be enough!Every time we are in Solvang, we have to come here for dinner. There is nothing on this menu that falls short of AMAZING!The last time we were in we ordered:Diver scallops- PERFECT. Seriously, you haven't lived until you have tasted these saucy bacon wrapped magical wonders. Crispy bacon wraps these perfectly plump and impeccably seasoned scallops. Make sure not to skimp on the sauce that sits below them to make these even more out of this world than they already are.Caesar Salad- Crisp romaine and a delicate, yet pungent dressing compliments this dish.3 Little Pigs- Another MUST have on the menu. Tender, juicy and flavorful. This dish makes you want to eat ""the other white meat"" always!Pumpkin seed crusted rack of Lamb- I think unicorns from another universe were put here on this planet specifically to make this dish. I never order lamb and when I do I expect it to be just right, this one did not disappoint.  Eat slowly, you want to soak up every delicious bite.We finished our meal with a flourless chocolate cake because my friend is gluten free. Now, I'm not typically a flourless cake type of girl, it doesn't really do much for me. It's usually all wrong. The texture and the flavor are usually lacking what every good cake needs (most likely gluten!) This cake however was the exception.

8/25/2016,"NV, NV","Not loving this place though we just came for lunch. Maybe we made a mistake not getting any meats but we had dips to share as a midday snack. The artichoke feta dip was just canned artichokes with feta added in and lemon.  If I wanted canned artichokes I could've gotten them down the street. In addition the girl who took our order and came to our table was not too friendly and seemed bothered by us asking questions. We were going to give this place a second shot for dinner but after her response, we decided not to. This review is based solely on the quality of the dip and the service. Oh I forgot the $3.50 glass of lemonade is made from a mix. I have a pet peeve of people being too lazy to make their own lemonade. I know if they skip steps making lemonade then they skip steps with their food too. My dad thought with it being so expensive that it must be fresh squeezed, wrong.",2 star rating,Kristie J.

The day was gorgeous and so I decided to stop by and check out this place.  As soon as I saw ""cumin & cinnamon pork belly sandwich"" written up on the board, I was SOLD!  It was funny because as I was standing there at the ordering area, the chef perked up and said to the cashier ""someone order the cumin pork?  yeah!!"" he said, ""that's my favorite!"".  That's a good response.The cashier guy (also a cook) was pretty cool - while I was standing there still figuring out which drink to order (Viognier was the final decision), we started chit-chatting about pork belly and he shared how he cooked it and I shared how I've prepared it before... it was a really fun chat that just reflected the style of this place and the people behind it.I sit down outside with the great weather and the lady (owner maybe?) brings out my HUMUNGAZOID pork belly sandwich.  I swear, it was the footprint of an iPad! and stacked, too!  The bread was toasted, the fennel and pineapple slaw was so flavorful.. and the pork belly was so soft and tender and juicy and.. OH so YUM.  Add to that that they had a sampler area of various gourmet salts for you to add to your meal.. I nabbed up a tiny spoonful of the black, hawwaiian, and wine-flavored salt and it elevated the pork indeed.Overall, I was impressed.  Great service (prompt, friendly, engaging, genuine), great meal (filling, innovative, flavorful, inventive) and a very enjoyable ambiance (they have a market inside where you can get the gourmet salts, jams/jellys/spreads/butters, and of course wine).  This place is a gem!  I'd return over and over.",5 star rating,April Q.
6/23/2018,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",It was ok. My steak was a bit tough but good flavor. The artichoke app is a spread and wasn't very flavorful. I got a side of veggies instead of potatoes and it was just steamed broccoli with no seasoning. Pretty bland for the price tag. The Brussels sprouts app was really good. Very flavorful and cooked to perfection. We also got the lamb chops. It was also pretty bland with out  any seasoning but did have a honey/ mustard tasting sauce in the side that was very sweet and completely masked the flavor of the lamb. The sauce was too much after a few bites and I found myself scraping it off each bite. Overall not horrible but over $100 for dinner for two should be way better than not horrible.,2 star rating,James H.

We were not warned about the wait, I did over hear the servers tell other guest that the food may take a while after ordering. Pastrami Sandwich- crispy, very similar looking to bacon pieces of pastrami. My bf liked it very much.

He even gave us a fresh batch of their delicious biscuits to take home after we requested to just take two we didn't eat. Now to the meal. I ordered the duck, which was cooked perfectly medium rare(per chef's suggestion) and came with some savory and somewhat spicy forbidden rice. It was truly the standout of the dish. The purple cauliflower was also quite savory and offered a nice substitute to potatoes. My mom had the meatloaf with bacon gravy, succotash and mashed potatoes. She loved the entire dish and despite feeling somewhat full still managed to get down every last morsel. We did save room for dessert and we opted to split the blood orange and coconut bread pudding. It was unlike any bread pudding either of us have had. It was sweet, but not overly so. The orange and coconut were very present but there was enough balance that I did not feel my teeth melting away. It was a great way to end a meal. We also used the Axxess card and received one entrée for free. It would've have been worth full price. Our service was great, our waters were constantly refilled and the meal was outstanding.

8/9/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Looking for a great dinner in Solvang? Come to Succulent. While the menu isn't large, it more than makes up for size with excellent quality dishes and good portions. The pumpkin seed crusted rack of lamb and the mushroom and wine lamb chops are pornographic goodness. Seriously, I can't remember the last time I ate such amazingly well prepared lamb. The potato and asparagus hash was delicious, as was the yellow pepper sauce that came with it...and I am no fan of sauces for the most part. Our waitress made some good recommendations and the rest of the service was polite and helpful. The wine list is fairly extensive and comprised of some excellent local selections. Prices are average compared to other restaurants. I will absolutely be returning here :)",5 star rating,Sean R.

We had the mule and the apple cider champagne and both cocktails were spot on. The biscuits and jam were a great introductory on a chilly fall evening. We got the charcuterie board to start with and it might have been one of the best ones we ever had. The truffled sopresatta? Our FAVORITE. She suggested the three little pigs and the short rib for entrees and both were very tasty. The three little pigs were our favorite out of the two, get it! We had the blood orange bread pudding for dessert and it was delicious!

11/16/2019,"Fremont, CA","We tried to eat here based on the Yelp reviews on November 15, 2019 at approx. 7 pm.  We approached the outside, ""wait here"" station"".  We told the hostess that we wanted to do a take out order.  She left us standing there while we tried to read the menu in the very dim light.    Eventually she came back and we told her we were ready to order.  We decided on a cobb salad and some sort of a fried chicken dish.  She said that was only available at lunch.  It is a salad, not sure why  a standard item would be available at lunch and not dinner.  Then she said ""you have to go inside to the bar"" to order.  It would have been nice to have told us that at the outset, in the light were we could read the menu.  We went inside and were standing at the bar.  We looked at the menu again.  Found other choices but it did not matter.  The two servers at the other end of the bar never came down to our end to see what we wanted even though we clearly were looking at a menu.  I guess there conversation must have been very important. We finally gave up and went to the Brewing Company.  The Succulent Café will carry on, it is a tourist town and there is a long parade of potential patrons to choose from, it shows.  Good luck, don't eat here, you can't, they will not serve you anyway.",1 star rating,craig u.

4/2/2016,"Baltimore, MD","Cute atmosphere and patio. Charcuterie was delicious and beautifully presented. I have actually never seen such a remarkably presented board of deliciousness.  Local cured meats, pickled veggies, mustards, jams, cheeses. To die for.  We had the Dragonette Rosè which was an amazing pairing with our appetizer and meal.  The meal- meh.  I had the fresh vegetable Cous Cous which was super bland and boring ( and definitely not worth $20). It was supposed to be all in season local veggies and it was a bowl of dry, undercooked Cous Cous with potatoes, tomatoes, and zucchini- not exactly what you would have expected considering the creativity and detail given to the charcuterie board.  I would definitively say avoid for dinner or entree and instead enjoy some wine and charcuterie on the patio- no need to actually eat a meal here. The three stars are for the board and wine, definitely not for the entrée.",3 star rating,Sarah L.

11/18/2014,"Sunnyvale, CA","Super cute restaurant in Solvang- not to mention one of the only places that is open past 7PM. We had reservations for 8PM but after realizing that the majority of stores were closed, we went to the restaurant at 7:15 and the staff happily seated us early. I really appreciated that they were so accommodating without making a fuss. It has a really great ambience- low lights and decorated tastefully. They bring out fresh baked mini biscuits with marmalade as a starter. They were SO good. Light and flakey and still warm from the oven. Amongst the five of us we ordered: the three little pigs, the braised short rib, the duck and the fried chicken.  None of us were disappointed. The food looks is plated so pretty which makes it even more appetizing. My friends also ordered the relish platter. I hate pickles so I didn't try it, but they chowed down. It comes with ranch and bleu cheese dressing. They mentioned bleu cheese is very strong so be careful when dipping! Overall, we had a great dining experience to end our weekend getaway. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",5 star rating,Prianka K.

6/13/2012,"San Francisco, CA","This review is for dinner.  We came here last Thursday and were served by Robert, one of the nicest waiters ever!  The scallop, spinach and grapefruit salad that he recommended was delicious.  The pepper they use here is aromatic and full-flavored (also, very strong so you'll know when it goes up your nose!).  I had the chicken with asparagus and sweet potato mash and it was delicious.  It even had salsa verde on the side (which I love).  The portions were perfect and all ingredients were fresh.  The short-braised beef was pretty good as well - but a little to sweet for me!  The bread pudding with seasonal berries and a side of cinnamon ice cream was the cherry on top.  YUM!  I had a glass of prosecco and it was pretty good.  They display their wines on an old dresser without doors, which is pretty cute and of course, they have little, cute succulents scattered throughout the cafe.  The lights are industrial and dim and your table will be candlelit.  Their house-made marmalade and biscuits (complimentary) were delicious and I believe they sell them in the cafe.  The mismatched utensils come out in Mason jars, which was really cute.  Total for one salad to share, two entrees, one dessert and two glasses of wine was $100.  If you're into fresh, unique and seasonal California dining, come here!Definitely would come back!",5 star rating,Chris L.

The breakfast scramble was a hearty portion, the potatoes with fresh peppers melted in your mouth.

1/18/2016,"Avila Beach, CA","While the menu is inspired, the food is not. Be aware that table service is not offered for lunch, it is counter ordering only. For our visit, the line took 5 minutes per order at the counter, just to place the order. The person on the register had difficulty finding menu items and processing the sale. There were 10 people in front of us, and the line wait was 30 minutes. Curiously, the counter guy warned the party in front of me that there would be another 30 minute wait for food, as the ""kitchen was backed up."" but did not offer that notice to me.The menu seemed intriguing, although limited. The descriptions and creativity were above average. The food however was average at best when delivered. Burgers were just OK. The house dressing was overpowering with tanginess, but still somehow lacked flavor. Fruit salad was just some cut up melon and pineapple, of dubious freshness. On a Saturday lunch, the overall cleanliness was poor. Many un-bused tables, and the lobby floor was messy. Poor lighting as well. The dining room seemed disheveled and no clear direction on how to enter the establishment and order.I can see the potential charm of the location and decor. The execution was well below potential. In general the various staff members encountered were friendly and positive.",2 star rating,Dave P.
12/27/2017,"La Quinta, CA","Mediocre and greasy food with a side of bad attitude. There is nothing succulent about this place. Conveniently located, it is difficult to miss, and if greasy food and poor service with a bad attitude is your thing, this place is perfect! Don't expect to get what you ordered. You wanted a side of fries? Well, if they are about to close (apparently they take a break at 3pm) you get pasta salad as a side!! The meatloaf must be one part of mystery meat and 2 parts fennel seeds to cover up the taste of the mystery meat. Ordered the pastrami expecting the cheese to be melted? Well, apparently that only applies to one slice and the rest is refrigerator cold. What about those ""wood boxes"" where your food will be served? If you don't mind leftover pieces of food served to previous customers stuck on those boxes, you get the ""full rustic"" experience! Visited on December 23rd 2017",1 star rating,Judy H.
3/16/2014,"Anaheim, CA","We have been coming into town for over 20 years and Solvang as a tourist community goes through many changes. One year to the next those nice finds can be gone. We were walking the town when the stomach let us know it is time to ""feed me"". With these types of towns, the first available we'll step into. This was the one. I ordered the bacon burger and the wife chose the fried chicken salad. This was a very tasty burger and the bacon excellent. It was a bit on the salty side but getting past that, the quality of beef and coarseness of grind made for a very nice mouth feel. The bacon was plenty thick and that alone I wondered how a BLT might be. ;) The tick steak fries was also excellent!  The wife's friend chicken salad was a generous portion and the fried chicken strips were cooked just right. Crunchy crust with tender juicy chicken. Quality of the greens was top shelf, crispy and fresh. We both left with happy stomachs from this meal. Typical prices for a meal in a tourist environment and I'd be inclined to come back to try more.

1/4/2014,"San Jose, CA","Great, dark, rich, woody, quirky, open establishment (with outlets for phone chargers) in the heart of the village.Visit #1 (1/2014)  Loved my thick, fresh, pastrami sandwich, but hated seeing people eating fries even though they weren't on the interesting but limited menu.  Sad that I had a dixie cup size of potato salad as a side instead, I called the cashier out on that, and she just said ""you kinda have to ask for them."" Lame.  So keep that in mind. Now I'm gonna ask everyone if they have fries wherever I go.  Including church.  (8/2015)  They're on the menu now.  Nevermind.Visit #2 (7/2015). Another visit we sat at the bar with young Jerry Lee Lewis lookalike Jeffrey (aka Chefrey).  We had some crustinis with a yummy goat cheese dip w/ toasted almonds and leeks so rich we couldn't eat it all.  My stomach had a whole lotta shakin going on. He let me try the vodka alternative they use for cocktails, which was good.  And he didn't make fun of me for getting a lemon drop.  We watched him make charcuterie plates: works of art that resemble an I Spy book.   Visit #3 (8/2015) I finally succumbed to the burger in the 805, almost too thick to eat, super meaty, and expertly well-done without being dry. $2 for a refillable Diet Coke (in a to go cup) is probably unbeatable. Switched from 4 to 5 stars.Visit #4 (12/2015) Shared a 4x4 charcuterie with my friends.  My wife loves them because they are so pretty (they are such little charcutie pies, oh yes they are), but I don't think they justify the price. $44?!  You know how many things I can get at Dollar Tree for $44??  (44, not including tax).Oh, but they offered us blankets.  They were scratchy donkey blankets from the mission basement, but blankets nonetheless. Cool, thanks.Visit #5 (1/2016).  The fries are crispy and pillowy, but the meatloaf sandwich was not great. The too-soft meatloaf was not very meaty, or very loafy for that matter. The stack of arugula, bacon, and buttery toasted bread was good, but the cheese (something similar to blue or goat cheese) was too overpowering.  I love the place, and it's the one I most recommend in Solvang, but this sandwich put the suck in succulent.  I'd rather eat Meat Loaf the musician.  Again.Visit #6 (4/2016). That burger though. Got it again, and it is no fluke: so good, again like a bumpy, home-grilled burger, well-done but juicy. And a manager inexplicably gave my wife a glass of wine, and it just happened to be her favorite kind: free.Visit #7 (11/2016). Got that fresh, thick bacon burger and fries again.  It's a lot of food.  A Korean took a picture of me, mistaking me for an elephant seal.",5 star rating,Glen N.

11/1/2013,"Mission Viejo, CA","To think we may have never tried this cafe if it not been for the fact that Paula's Pancake House no longer allows dog on their patio.  Even if they had, we were already having some reservations about the cramped spacing on the patio and having Kaya with us.  Paula's directed us to their sister restaurant The Belgium Cafe which allows dogs, but we never made it that far (we had actually eaten there in the past).  We stopped in front of the Succulent Cafe Wine Charcuterie because we saw the large patio area.  My wife went in, inquired if they were dog friendly (they were) and grabbed a menu.Rohlinism:  Great discoveries are often made by accident.The cuisine is mostly American and the lunch menu consists of:Daily SoupSimple SaladsComposed SaladsAn Artisan Cheese BoardHouse Made Charcuterie Board 2 + 2 (2 Charcuterie and 2 Cheeses with Accoutrements)Hot and Cold SandwichesDaily SidesSweetsThey also offer a Soup or Salad and Sandwich Combo and a Kid's Menu.We were still not completely sold on the idea of eating here, if felt weird riding 3 hours to a Danish village and eating American cuisine.  What finally sold us was the family leaving the restaurant, who stopped to say ""hello"" to Kaya.  This gave us an opportunity to inquire about their meal and thanks to their enthusiastic feedback, we were sold!  We made our way to the back table in the patio area and started to decide what we were going to eat.Service on the patio area works as follows:  You order at the counter inside, you are handed your drinks and a small clay flower pot with a number on it.  You grab napkins, condiments and silverware on the side and walk back to your table.  The food is brought to your table when it is ready.With so many wonderful items on the menu, the decision was not an easy one.  My better half settled on the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Salad ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ) while I opted for the Succulent Bacon Burger ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ) with extra bacon ($1 extra).  Laina chose the Fresh Brewed Iced Tea to drink and I ordered the Fresh Lemonade.The wait wasn't very long and the food was outstanding!  The Buttermilk Fried Chicken Salad came with Panko Breaded Fried Chicken, Dried Cherries, Mixed Greens, Arugula, Spinach, Cornbread Pepitas, and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.  The salad including a large chicken breast which was cooked perfectly and the panko gave the chicken a delicious flavor.  The dressing had a good buttermilk flavor without being overstated and my wife surprisingly loved the pepitas.  The only drawback was the dried cherries which my wife didn't enjoy.  The portion was quite large and she only finished about half the plate.  A truly excellent salad.The burger includes their blend of Chuck and Brisket, House Bacon, Heirloom Tomato, Shaved Red Onion, Butter Lettuce and House Spread.  The burger was truly succulent!  Juicy, cooked to the right temperature and excellently seasoned.  The bacon was crispy, but not burnt and had an excellent flavor.  The extra bacon was 3 large strips and a great value.  A small regret being I didn't try the burger before putting some condiments on the burger, the meat seasoning was more than worthy of standing on its own.  My wife had a bite and we agreed this was the best burger either of us have ever eaten.  The burger came with crispy fries which were lightly battered and perfectly deep fried to a light golden brown.The food was so spectacular that we had an uninvited guest for the first portion of our meal.  A bee would not leave our meal in peace nor the table next to us.  Eventually the bee landed at our neighbor's table and was permanently removed from the meal.  We were extremely impressed with this café and hopefully will be able to return there one day!",5 star rating,Rohlin A.

It was a bigger lady who had the worst customer service and she forgot our orders and never offered us water and kept forgetting our drinks.

10/29/2013,"Orange County, CA","One of the best charcuterie plates, I have had! This rivals the ones at Cellar in San Clemente.I had been reading the reviews and knew that I really needed to check this place out. I was on vacation in Solvang with my family and it can be kinda tough to make it out of the family schedule sometimes.We tried to go on Tuesday and just our luck... That's the one day they are closed, such a bummer. Luckily we made it back before we had to go home. We came for lunch and ordered a charcuterie plate, the spicy fried chicken sandwich and some wine. They had quite the wine list! The spicy fried chicken sandwich was pretty delicious! It was a thinly pounded bread chicken breast with a nice sriracha based cream sauce and Point Reyes blue cheese. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that went perfectly with the sandwich. Next out was the most amazing looking charcuterie plate I have ever seen, check out the picture, I can't remember every single item...but there was raw honey with a piece of the comb, marcona almonds, grapes, berries, candied pecans,pickled onions, capers all that along with the tasty meats and cheeses!!

We got a meat and cheese board and a flat bread pizza to share. We also got a bottle of Prosecco, and it was very tasty. As a ""congratulations"", our waitress gave us a strawberry shortcake on a biscuit on the house!Clean establishment, friendly staff, good wine, good food!We really enjoyed ourselves, it was probably the best place that we ate at during our stay in Solvang!

10/26/2015,"Foothill Ranch, CA","Visited Solvang twice. Ate at Succulent Cafe Wine Charcuterie twice. Got the Spicy Fried Chicken both times. Worth it both times. Other memorable mentions: the Smoked Shortrib and the Succulent Bacon Burger.The two times I've been here, it has been super busy. When I mentioned traveling to Solvang to my friends, they automatically recommend this place so I know it has to be quite popular. We ordered from the counter and waited outside for a little bit for a table to open up. It was hot that day but luckily the next table that opened up was shaded by an umbrella. That's the only downside of this place--you'll wait a while in line, then you'll wait a little while for a table. I haven't been here yet when it hasn't been busy so I'm not even sure if this place ever gets un-busy.Our food came out pretty quickly as well as our drinks. I love the relaxing atmosphere of this place. I highly recommend the Spicy Fried Chicken sandwich. It's not so much spicy (as in hot) but more spiced with flavor. Their charcuteries boards look amazing but I didn't get a chance to try it. Would love to get wine and cheese from here since they look like they know their foods. This cafe feels like a great place to casually dine and have good conversation in with friends and loved ones. I think it's one of my more favorite places to eat in when in Solvang...hence, being here two times.",5 star rating,Katrina H.

My boyfriend had the bacon burger and I got the beet salad, but we were probably too deliriously sated to enjoy them after the platter!Service was good.

Sautéed spinach, fresh tomato, perfect poached eggs, and decadent Hollandaise, with the option to add meat if desired. Delicious sautéed peppers/onions/country potatoes served with the Eggs Benedict.

I wouldn't normally order meatloaf, but I got the sandwich and was rewarded by a juicy, flavorful dish. Not at all dry or weird textured, like meatloaf can be sometimes. The lemonade was good, too-- not too sweet. We sat outside in their lovely succulent garden under a windmill. Relaxing break in our afternoon. :)",5 star rating,Celeste C.
12/16/2013,"Los Angeles, CA",Eggs Benedict is delish but ginormous!You order at the front and wait for them to bring your food. It can take a while but I think they do it so you build up a huge appetite and then they serve you with a humongo portion!,4 star rating,Rachel S.

Ordered the Fried Chicken/Mac cheese/collards and we also ordered the 3 Pigs in a blanket.  My chicken was perfect. Great flavor and crispness. The Mac cheese was ok. Sauce was not thick enough.

The flavorful meat help complimented with the potato hash. Country Fried Steak Biscuit - Buttery Flaky goodness of a biscuit. Yum!!! Gravey was flavorful and not too creamy and was just the right balance to offset the crunchy chicken steak. It was really good and I hate chicken so it says a lot.

5/6/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","The bacon burger is amazing.   This place is a must from all the local places in the area.   Everything about this burger ooooozzz'd freshness.The bacon felt like it came from the pic that morning.   The bread felt like it was baked that very same day, the fries tasted like they were freshly cut.  The meat patty was tasty and thick.Be warned- they have lunch hours from 11A-3P and dinner from 5P to close; which means they are closed for a good two hours in the middle of the afternoon.MY RECOMMENDATION:I am not a breakfast guy- I know they do serve breakfast though.  I also got the vibe this was more of a better lunch place.  If you are like me, have a morning glass of wine stop here for lunch and then finish off the day walking around town and wine tasting around Solvang.  Please try and book a hotel within town.   The cops are all over the place; its definitely DUI heaven.   You see the most cops in the late afternoon and evenings.  So stay away from your vehicle when wine tasting or have a designated driver.Again the burger is amazing, you cannot go wrong.",5 star rating,Joe Y.
11/27/2016,"San Gabriel, CA","AMBIANCE: - The interior was very cute and quaint, with bottles of wine lining one of the walls. - Because I happened to visit Solvang on a very rainy and cold day, the moment I stepped into Succulent Cafe felt so good; it was such a nice and toasty haven away from the cold outdoors. - One of the issues I encountered was that there are only 2 bathrooms for the decently-sized cafe so it was a little annoying because the bathrooms always seemed to be occupied. FOOD: - Grilled Tuna Melt Sandwich: There were a lot of chopped olives interspersed with the tuna and I felt that there were just too many olives because it completely overpowered the flavor of the tuna. I know this is a grilled sandwich, but the bread was also just a little on the greasy side. I felt the need to wipe my hands every time I put the sandwich down to drink water. - Spicy Fried Chicken: This sandwich was really delicious (although could've been a little spicier). The chicken was perfectly crispy, the lettuce fresh, and the buttermilk ranch flavor was there but not overpowering. - French Fries: The french fries are also really good, fried to a perfect golden brown with the right crunch. SERVICE: - The service here was excellent. All the waiters were so kind and went out of their way to make sure your food tastes great. Overall, I would recommend Succulent Cafe for a satisfying meal. Because we were just dropping in for a quick lunch, I didn't get to try all the menu items I wanted to. I would come back to try some of their delicious-sounding dinner items and maybe have a glass of wine.",4 star rating,Tiffany L.
2/25/2018,"Covina, CA",I stopped by this place during their happy hour which was about 3pm on a Friday. They had a very limited menu and we couldn't order anything else which I understand but it still affected my first experience here. It was pretty dead and the appetizers we got were ok.

I shared the curry salad and pulled pork sandwich with my friend. Both were pretty good. The portions are big. I also had a bite of the chicken and biscuits. The biscuit was a hard and the chicken was good. Nice and moist with pretty good flavor. Servers are just okay. I'd probably would get annoyed of tourist too but this is literally a tourist town so they are your paycheck so maybe putting a smile on your face would be nice. Just saying,4 star rating,Christy P.

8/26/2013,"Walnut Creek, CA","About 2 weeks ago, we dropped by for a lazy Sunday lunch. Seating outside was completely packed, so we went inside. DH braved the long line and ordered. That part took forever, but the food came out in a reasonable time. My house-mix green salad had some dark, partially decomposed leaves in it. Obviously not fresh! We asked to have it switched out and the server quickly obliged. Unfortunately, the new salad wasn't the same as my old one. Where were the walnuts? They did put the pear slices back, which was good. Most of the leaves were okay, but there were still a few mushy ones.DH's house-made charcuterie hero sandwich was extremely salty. The roll was so-so and didn't look house-made. Meats were tasty, but there wasn't anything else to balance out the flavor. To be fair, DH got it without the smoked gouda.Overall, we probably won't be back. Perhaps we ordered poorly, but the old leaves in my salad are not excusable.",2 star rating,Kari C.
8/11/2014,"Costa Mesa, CA","Amazing meat loaf, great atmosphere inside but wished we were able to get a patio seat. We decided to do a tap beer vs a wine. They have a solid wine selection and 4 or 5 beers on tap. The beer rotate so it will be a tool of the dice to what's available. Wine selection is more extensive.Solid props to both server & buser (never had water glass below half full).Overall great service, food, & atmosphere.",5 star rating,Kent M.
12/9/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm torn on Succulent Cafe. In general, it was a good experience and it's a very pretty place but a few things turned me off. First, the good.GOOD- They were easy to work with when I wanted to change my reservations- The service was generally decent and attentive- The charcuterie board was amazing- The fried chicken was also amazingBAD- My partner and I were seated on the patio, right beside a huge window that looks onto the large-party-table inside. The staff pulled down the blinds as we sat down, which is fine. It would have been awkward to sit there staring in at people. As we finished up and left, it had gotten dark, and as a straight couple sits down at the same table, the staff immediately open the blinds. What gives? If anything, it would have been even MORE awkward at night with the blind open as the light from the dining room would shine down on the patio diners. Definitely something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth after a nice dinner. Anyway, I'm not sure if Solvang has a ""small town"" mentality but I've never experienced that kind of thing in LA proper.- The steak was overly salty- The macaroni and cheese was kind of mushy- The collard greens were tasteless",3 star rating,Chris C.

It's not exceptionally busy but the lunch crowd is filtering in at a standard pace.  Walk up and order and find a seat.  We did, but why did the drinks take over 10 minutes to come to us? And they didn't even bring the right flavored mimosa.  The burger and chicken sandwich took a half hour plus to reach the table.  I don't think the food was necessarily worth the wait. But it was good for what it was. The fries are nothing special so you're basically paying $15 for just the burger.  We talked about coming back for breakfast when we were standing in line to order, but I think me and my company will pass.",3 star rating,N A.

8/12/2013,"Cerritos, CA","They have weekly specials, and today there was a choice of veggie pizza or a veggie plus pizza that had different peppers as well as Sopressata sausage.  I had to repeat myself maybe five times to the girl at the register, emphasizing the ""plus"" part of the veggie plus pizza.  I even reconfirmed it after she rang it up. When I got the regular veggie pizza, which was just a margherita, I told the girl who delivered it that it was wrong.  She had the most, ""I don't give a flying fuck/shit"" attitude.  She told me that is was what was on the ticket, an itemized ticket I never received, and left with that.  I wouldn't go back just because of the attitude, but I have to admit that the food is pretty good here.If you're going to visit, it's probably better to stick with pork dishes.  They did a great ham sandwich ($10.50).  They cure it in-house.  The ham had a richness unlike any regular ham.  They added caramelized onions, cheese, sauteed apple slices, dijon mustard, and cheese.  The combination of these created such a nice flavor, and the apples gave a subtle sweetness and crunch without being over powering.  I was impressed.The pizza ($10.50), too, although incorrect, was delicious.  It super thin, wood fired it seems, with a great smokey flavor.  I'm a fan of thin, crunchy pizza.  (I still remember and miss the super thin, crunchy ones they used to sell at the bygone Fedco.) Their chicken quesadilla ($11 I think since there were none written on the board, and I didn't receive an itemized receipt)  isn't just pieces off chicken.  They use whole breasts it seems. Again, they really do seem to pay attention to the quality of the ingredients they use.  The turkey sandwich ($11 or so) also included slice of bacon, which tasted different from regular store bought bacon.  I ordered lemonade ($3.95) which looked good.  It's strong and tart.  I liked it, but the rest of the family thought it was too sour.  We're huge fans of the Dog on Stick lemonade.  I thought the tartness of this lemonade was refreshing.  My bill was about $67.  You order at the counter, find a table that's available, and put your number on the table for the delivery.  I still left a $6 tip afterwards, and I don't really know why.  The food was good, but I don't give a flying fuck if they don't.",2 star rating,Con N.

5/14/2016,"Cincinnati, OH","Pleasant setting on the quaintly weird main drag of Solvang; good atmosphere, friendly young staff, attractive selection of local Santa Barbara County wines, and a pretty nice (and huge) charcuterie board. what we thought would be a modest selection of two meats and cheeses came with big mounds of pickled veggies and big stacks of salami and a nice duck prosciutto.But the selection of entrees was unusual. Not sure why there is a Danish town in the middle of what used to be Spanish mission and cowboy territory and is now boutique wine country in the first place, but the Southeast US touches on the menu (fried chicken, grits, collards, etc.) don't really fit with any of those identities and add just one more personality to the Sybil-like flavor of the town.

I yelped other restaurant options and found this to have some vegan friendly options. When we arrived it was decently slow so you'd expect the service to be great. A huge bonus I noticed when reading reviews were the mimosas. I love them and was looking forward to trying theirs. We were sat , served water glasses , and brought biscuits. I went with the veggie skewers served over rice . The food was a perfect portion and was very satisfying in flavor. Our server was kind , but not the best. We were not offered anything to drink at any point. We felt as though the service toward us was not as attentive as it was to the other family's around us( we thought possibly because of our young age) [we are all in our early 20's ,but respectful and quiet none the less].

The place was nice looking, indoor and outdoor seating, and a friendly staff. The huge problems were the wait and sadly... the food. I have a feeling the poor quality food was a product of how long it sat on the counter for. I waited 20 minutes to place and order, and then 50 minutes to get the food when they quoted 30. It wasn't like we were alone is this either. Everyone had the same starved/hangry look on their face and we were hearing wait times of over and hour. Once the food came out, my bacon burger (supposed to be their go to item) was super well done and practically crispy. If you like that, then awesome.. unfortunately I ordered it medium. My fiance's meal wasn't much better. There are a lot of great places in Solvang, I'd suggest picking a different one until they figure out how to handle rush hour.",2 star rating,Nicholas C.
12/7/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I rarely write bad reviews but I definitely did not have a good experience.  Food was decent but not good enough to overlook at other flaws of the restaurant.  Maybe it was my high expectations that ruined the experience, not sure but I can tell you it was not a nice one.  This is a place where you order, sit, and wait for your food to arrive.  There aren't visible signs out in the front and 2 doors.  I encountered many confused patrons waiting to be seated.  We went at 10:00 am on Sunday.  We ordered and immediately noticed our bill was wrong.  Just before leaving we found out their system entered an item $2.00 more than the price.  Self-service for coffee.  3 carafes were all empty, ugh.  We go inside to find a table.  We see 3 uncleaned (?) tables and sat down at the table which seemed to be the cleanest one we can find.  I see a patron walking with his food back to the cashier; this does not make me feel well but I figure probably not a big deal.  Another patron sent her food back 2 times.  Now, I'm getting little bit not too thrilled to be here.  The 3 tables are still dirty and not cleaned.  Waiter/waitress (?) carries out the food and asks who ordered who, though we were specifically given a number, ok, whatever.  We get our food, at first looks awesome, and first bite was great.  Something didn't feel right so I check my food.  Sausages are burnt on the other side.    Oh well, at least I tried, right?

It was great to find semi-healthy food in Solvang that was open past 9pm.

You have to keep walking straight ahead and you will see the cash register and menus hanging up on the wall where you order your food first. The wine and beer selection are on the right side of the wall. Below are the condiments and water :)After you order your food, the cashier will give you a little ?bucket with utensils for your party and napkins. It also has a number on it so the server knows where to deliver your food. From there, you can go on and choose a seat!(I gave those instructions because as I was sitting in the dining room, I saw multiple parties enter through the side waiting to be seated, but was told to order first. It looks confusing because the side entrance has a podium that looks like a host's table).I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich (only because I felt like I've been eating so much meat lately) with a side of fries. The sandwich was delicious! The vegetables were grilled nicely and seasoned perfectly. It may have looked like a small amount of food, but it was definitely filling.",4 star rating,Danielle H.

7/17/2015,"Long Beach, CA","I have enjoyed Succulent Cafe in the past, but BEWARE there has been a change of ownership and menu and most importantly quality. The ""new"" menu focuses on burgers, pasta and pizza. Nothing imaginative here and the quality of the ingredients is mediocre. I ordered a burger, safe right? Other than tasting a lot of salt, there was no taste. The fries had obviously been frozen. No amount of ketchup could possibly make them taste like freshly cut potatoes. My husband ordered from the more gourmet side of the menu. His duck was flavorless and the sauces were tasteless as well. Excellent ingredients always shine. So sorry Succulent Cafe has decided to cut corners on the quality of ingredients. So sorry they were able to keep the name and fool me into eating at their restaurant. I won't make the same mistake again.",2 star rating,Brooke K.
12/4/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Quite pricey! Everything was delicious, but if our total had been %10 less than it was, I would give this place 5 stars.We had the 2+2 charcuterie board and while the smoked beef tenderloin amazed me, there were half as many pieces of it compared to the lackluster pork tenderloin. The soft brie-goat cheese blend and the hard, aged cheddar were quite nice and the assortment of picked vegetables, nuts and dried fruit on the board was a wonderful addition. However,I really have to impress how the price was just barely over the edge of ridiculousness. This wonderful establishment is sure to fail if they keep their prices in the clouds.",3 star rating,Charlie S.

5/23/2016,"Harpenden, United Kingdom","As Slovang is a quirky Danish themed town (it is and is a lot of fun just walking through the streets). And one of the things Danes are famous for is pork and moreover proper bacon. Succulents logo of a pig drew me in to the prospect of them serving proper Danish bacon - not that greasy fatty heart attack streaky bacon you find all over the states. No, proper lean back bacon. I was excited, after not eating proper bacon for quite some time.I was told by one of the staff at the cash desk the restaurant had nothing to do with the Danish influence of the town. As such did not offer Danish bacon.I was hangry and needed a feed asap.Service was slow and our food took sometime to arrive. However, there had been a charity fun run in the town and as such the town was buzzing full of people.Anyway,  I ordered the bacon burger and it was mediocre.Eating outside was nice though. They had lots of planters with interesting flowers in, that made the place look pretty.Next time we come back to Slovang I will have to do further research. I did however manage to find proper bacon in one of the local supermarkets. I should have bought some and asked Succulent to cook me a nice big bacon butty.My expectation of Succulent has changed due to the fact I now know they disassociate themselves with the Danish themed town. I possible would go back, not on the hunt for normal proper bacon, but sampling their menu for what it is. As I said, sitting outside was pleasant.",3 star rating,David R.

10/5/2015,"Alameda, CA","Breakfast. We came here for breakfast.  I want to come back again and again until I've had every last thing on the menu. The BF selected the Eggs Benedict, and I had the Fried Chicken with biscuit and gravy.  Each came with a slice of bacon. It was a switch for us. I'm the Benedict person. He's all about the biscuits and gravy. He sorta regretted it. But the bacon....OMG the bacon.  I've never seen two perfectly poached eggs together. The Benedict seemed to be a customer favorite and it was easy to see why. It's visually mouth watering.  And it also has bacon.  And tasty home fries. The Bloody Mary is served with bacon.  No celery. We didn't realize they served those.  Our loss.  Next time.Bacon - thick, smoked, sweet, meaty, not greasy or fatty. If it was all you could it, I'd never stop. Good thing it isn't,  but a side of bacon is more than 4 pieces and they're not thin and limp.Fried chicken - white meat patty,  breaded, nice spice. Similar in form and taste to chicken fried steak, but oh so much better. We passed this place the night before on our way to the Solvang Brewery. This location used to be the Windmill Gift Shop. The town has changed over the years. A lot. Some change is sad. Others are a vast improvement.  This is one and its so unique. I had never heard of a charcuterie.  Now I have come to realize there is nothing like it within 150 miles, if not more.  This is a place known for meat. They have a pig for their logo! If breakfast is that good,  lunch and dinner should be off the hook. Wish it were a little closer to Huntington Beach,  but weekends away have become far more intriguing with all the changes to this area in general.It ain't your parents Solvang.

It was early evening and there was quite the buzz already which made me feel like I was in the right place. I know that they opened for dinner a short time ago, explains the waiting in past reviews, I took the chance at a long wait for my meal and hoped this was not the case tonight.  I ordered Charcuterie for an appetizer which absolutely blew my mind. Sweet, Sour, salt, hearty and delicate all creatively displayed on a cutting board. My dinner was served right as I was slowing down on my Charcuterie. They worked out their kinks. I ordered the pork belly porchetta, AH mazing. Every bite was heaven. Seems that the staff are a quite the experts on wine pairings with their food as well. It was educational listening to their suggestions. Everything just tasted so good. I of course order dessert, so good, large portion, I should have shared with my neighbor. I over hear this woman tell the server that she was rendered ""speechless"" . I related. So aside from sitting at the bar rather than the window seat that I envisioned, my experience from beginning to end was a good one. It is beautiful inside, everyone working was happy and informative,  I will just have to make a reservation next time.",5 star rating,Cristi S.

4/7/2015,"Santa Clara, CA","LOVE this place! Didn't expect to find this gem in the small Danish town of Solvang:The patio outside was already so beautiful with the strung up lights, and when you walk in.. It's this adorable hipsterish restaurant (with wooden decor, mason jars, anything hipster and rustic you can think of) - just my style haha. Instead of candles at your table, they fill a mason jar with a string of lights! I'm definitely stealing this idea for my room decor.Oh yeah, and the food - so good! + Complimentary  biscuits and housemade jam - I don't normally talk about the free bread/biscuits, but this was so good, it deserves its own place in the review. + 2 meats and 2 cheese charcuterie - to share with the bf (which was a little too much when we both also ordered entrees). But the plating and arrangement of this was SO eye- pleasing, and also very scrumptious indeed. It's not just a regular meat and cheese plate, but they give you pickled veggies, an assortment of dried fruits and nuts, and dips, and present it like artwork.+ 3 little piggies - this was absolutely delightful! The bf ordered this and I regretted not getting the same thing after having a taste.. Or many tastes.. There's bacon-wrapped super tender and flavourful pork loins, on top of some veggies and delicious potato cakes. Highly recommend this dish!+ thai coconut curry with jasmine rice - this dish was just decent in comparison to everything else. Nothing outstanding:.

12/17/2012,"Long Beach, CA","Solvang, the Danish capitol of the US!Home to many wineries, Danish bakeries, and the greatest breakfast sandwiches EVER!Succulent Café & Trading Company is a tiny place that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. However, during Bfast and lunch there are no waiters. You place and pay for your order at the counter, grab a ceramic pot with a number on it, pick up your own utensils and find a table on either their indoor or outdoor dining areas and wait for someone to drop off your meals. You can also take your grub to go. They also sell housemade jams, pickles, peppers, salts, spices and more. My wife and I ate Bfast here recently. We started with a side of their housemade bacon and breakfast potatoes, which was made with grilled onions and peppers. The thick cut, smokey bacon was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. The potatoes were great as well. For our main meals we each got a biscuit Bfast Sammie.Me- The Succulent Plus- Cinnamon & Cumin Pork Belly, Bacon Gravy, Pineapple Chutney & A Poached Egg yelp.com/biz_photos/GlXO…  Wife- Fried Chicken & Gravy Biscuit- Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Bacon, Aged Cheddar & Bacon Gravy yelp.com/biz_photos/GlXO…OK, so you couldn't really pick up these biscuit sandwiches (I tried) but since all the ingredients are housed between a housemade biscuit it's considered a sandwich.  My pork belly biscuit sandwich was insanely delicious and HUGE. The dish packed a flavor punch. The PB was tender, fatty and was perfectly seasoned (You could actually taste the cinnamon & cumin).  The bacon gravy was thick, rich and loaded with smokey bacon. The perfectly prepared poached eggs yolk exploded when I cut into it, allowing the golden goodness to run all over the PB. The pineapple chutney brought a sweet element to the party and the housemade biscuit was light, flaky and buttery. They're not stingy with their portions either. There was so much PB in my Sammie. The Succulent Plus was by far the best Bfast sandwich I've ever eaten.My wife's Fried Chicken & Gravy was amazing as well. The chicken was crispy, tender and oh so juicy. I also loved the melted, gooey aged cheddar. Overall, this may be my favorite chicken and gravy dish ever. Simple yet perfectly executed. To wash down our food we got their housemade prickly pear lemonade, which was sweet and refreshing. Best of all, this place is cheap. Our entire bill was about $34, which is amazing considering how large their portions are and that almost everything is made in-house. The wait time for our food was a bit long but this place was crowded and their kitchen is tiny. I love Succulent Café! It saddens me that it's so far from my home.

I will start out with the positives; service was good, the decor was cute ""farm house"" style, really cool coke a cola water glasses, and the little tiny biscuits with freshly made jam were pretty tasty as an alternative to bread. (we were there for dinner)However, it was extremely overpriced and bland. My husband and I got the specials. I had the ""Farmer's Market Focus"" Chef's choice of preparation on an abundance of local veggies, over grains. What that turned out to be was mushroom risotto for $23. really?! abundance of local veggies was mushrooms and leeks?!?! and $23?! serious. It's partly my fault for not clarifying what that exactly meant. It wasn't a bad dish....just  not what I was expecting, and not worth $23. My husband had the meat pasta special which was linguine with shrimp in a lite tomato sauce. Oh, and basil. The portion size was SUPER small! And he is from Europe...so we are used to small portions....we even LIKE small portions....but this was ridiculous. On top of that it lacked flavor. $19. hmmmmm......didn't try the desert because we were just too disappointed. Maybe I was too excited because of all the good reviews. I'm not sure.

Do yourself a favor and get the Charcuterie and cheese platter, but bring some friends, the thing is massive for an appetizer, and on;y gets bigger the more options you add to it, and while my girlfriend and I barely finished the 2+2 platter, I feel like we missed out by not getting the 4+4. I had the nightly special pork chop, it was perhaps a bit too sweet, but I can't knock it too much, as I cleared my plate of everything but the bone. My girlfriend had the duck, and it was perfect in every way. Saw ""Three little pigs"" go by to another table, and almost ordered a second entree, it looked that good. The service was good, not quite great, but I think the poor kid assisting our waitress was new and still learning the ropes, can't knock the restaurant down over that. The wine list was a bit pricey for what they offer, but not terrible, entrees were very reasonable, our bill for two was about $125 including a bottle of wine, not fast food prices, but take the wine out of the equation and it was marginally more than you'd spend at TGI Fridays, for food that's world's better.We will be going back on our next Solvang trip.",5 star rating,Maxwell Y.

I asked if it would be much longer after 45 minutes and my patience ran thin. It was Black Friday I guess but we were never told there would be such a wait, nor was there an acknowledgment or an apology when our food did arrive.Wait aside the food was good; pulled pork and buttermilk fried chicken sandwiches but not worth the wait unfortunately.

Their homemade fennel patties we absolutely NOT patty worthy. They were bland with an overwhelming flavor of fennel and that's it. How do you ruin pork?! I had the BLT, how the hell do you call a BLT with two slices of bacon?!?! The bread was stale, sauce was just straight uncomplimentary and why couldn't you just fry an egg for the top?? I also tried the spicy chicken sandwich. I would rather had gone to mcdonalds over this place, horrible breading with seasoning overpowering without a taste of chicken. Honestly the only thing good on the menu (I've been twice) is French fries. AVOID THE MORNING AND LUNCH.  My advice would be to wait and have the evening menu which I have yet to try.

7/27/2017,"Azle, TX","We arrived in Solvang today and had dinner reservations at the Succulent Cafe tonight. We immediately enjoyed the atmosphere, open and welcoming, cookbooks on a shelf, nice music in the background and our friendly waiter, Ty.  We ordered a couple local wines, HItching Post ""cork dancer"" pinot noir and Stolpman Syrah, both excellent.  We wanted a light dinner since it was getting late.  Steve ordered a charcuterie board with 4 meats and 4 cheese.  What was he thinking?  That pig board was huge, piled high with salami, proscuitto, chunks of cheese, local jams, olives, nuts, vegetables, pickles with a a generous serving of crostini on the side.  Yikes!  Fortunately, I ordered 2 appetizers for my dinner, seared white tiger shrimp with fire-roasted corn and avocado salsa, spicy aioli on baby gem lettuce and crispy Brussels sprouts with applewood bacon, aged parmesan and balsamic reduction.  My shrimp was cooked perfectly, spicy and paired well with the crispy lettuce and salsa.  The avocado was still firm and had the right texture.  The Brussels sprouts appeared to be deep fried and were a little over done, however they were still very tasty and I ate way too many.  Steve's huge meat and cheese board was a big hit.  We nibbled on all the items and enjoyed them with our wine.  Our waiter, Ty, was super helpful in suggesting wineries during our stay.  We will probably come back to Succulent Cafe for wine glasses and breakfast.

9/25/2014,"San Jose, CA","Walked in at 4:52 with the hope of having an early dinner. We were informed by the hostess that we had 8 minutes to order from happy hour and then dinner was going to start at 5:30. Fine. We sat down and quickly picked an appetizer. Of course we were getting the charcuterie, that's why we went there. However we weren't approached by a waitress. There was a waitress standing next to us writing down the specials who saw us be seated. However, she didn't approach our table so I assumed she wasn't our waitress. She quickly disappeared to who knows where. The hostess sits another family and informs them that there's 4 minutes left of happy hour. You see where this is going right? We get the hostess' attention and ask if we can get our waitress. (BTW when I was a waitress, too many years ago to mention, we had 1 minute and 30 secs to greet a table. I guess that's just too much to ask when there is only two guests in the restaurant.) Finally the previously mentioned waitress saunters up to our table all casual like ""oh did you guys want something"". So my husband says that we wanted to order from the happy hour menu. She checks her watch and tells us it's to late after we waited 10 minutes for service! Two main reasons I take issue with this situation. Firstly, the happy hour menu was the only menu we could order from. So, what? She just thought we were going to sit down for half hour? Secondly, there is no cooking involved in charcuterie!! All she had to do was put stuff on a plate. Being a waitress is a physical, fast paced job. That waitress is way too lazy for that kind of work. Do yourself and that restaurant (I've read the other reviews, service is an issue) a favor and go find a new job.

The flatbread pizza was as expected, the seafood in the pasta was over cooked, the cheeseburger was greasy and could not be properly lettuce wrapped because they don't have leaves of lettuce so they served it on a bed of greens and finally the fried chicken was delicious, collard green tasteless and mac and cheese okay. The service was adequate. The restaurant is comfortable minus the door being propped open and the flies that buzzed around our food and the chairs are very uncomfortable to seat it. The seats are really short and being tall makes the seating uncomfortable. So all in all have the fried chicken and seat at the bar if you are tall.",3 star rating,Yvonne S.

So reserve early.3) No need for reservations for breakfast or lunch but be ready to wait.4) They are only open Wednesday-Sunday (9-3) for breakfast and lunch and Thursday-Sunday for dinner (6-9).5) we got:Bacon wrapped diver scallops - delicious.  Sambas aioli had the perfect kick. I'm salivating honking about this dish.Walnut crusted salmon - this was good and the salmon was perfectly cooked but... If you're coming here for the first time like I did last night, why waste your dish with a fish that tastes the same no matter how its served? (Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but compared to the short rib and the other dishes we saw being served to the other tables around us, I kind of wish I tried one thing else.Short rib.  Short rib.  Get it.  Melts in our mouth kind of  Mmmmmmmmnnnnnnnn.  Usually when I travel, I attempt to try as many different restaurants as possible...

My dad, sister, and I walked in around 7:10pm on Sunday, and even though there were plenty of seats available, the hostess said they were booked with reservations and wouldn't get us seated until 8. She claimed that everyone there had reservations but our cousin was already eating there at the time and I know she didn't have one. (When my cousin offered to pull up an empty table next to theirs the hostess said no because it was reserved.)About 15 minutes later my other cousin called and they said they had several available seats and to just come in. When she confronted the hostess and the manager, they claimed to have had 4 cancelations within those 15 minutes. By this time the restaurant was nearly empty. The manager offered to buy my dessert if I sat down to eat but I rejected the offer. Looking through other reviews, I have found a few more similar cases among other yelpers.

6/8/2015,"Hermosa Beach, CA","I've been to Succulent Cafe 3x now. The food is good but I tend to always want one additional note on dishes. A bit of heat on the breakfast sandwich or some sourness to the bacony, rich meatloaf to break-up the flavors. The breakfast menu is appealing until you learn you can only have your eggs poached. Best option, the fried chicken & gravy biscuit since it highlights what they do best -biscuits, fried chicken and heavy gravy.  Skip the cinnamon bun, which was a bit dry. I would love to stop in for lunch and grab some food to bring to the wineries as that menu seems to offer a few more interesting flavors but i can confidently say that Succulent is a great spot to help you get over your headache from a day of wine tasting.",3 star rating,Alexa B.

He was most excited by the confetti rice, which I swear looked just like rice-a-roni. Go figure.I had the spicy hen, which was bacon wrapped chicken breast in a spicy sauce. The bacon was only crispy on top of the chicken. The bacon underneath seemed completely raw which made me question whether or not the chicken was cooked through. The ""spicy"" sauce was so...bizarre. Hubby and I couldn't put our finger on it, but it almost tasted like bbq sauce mixed with hot sauce. Not tasty at all. I really wanted to love this place.

We ordered the catch of the day Halibut which came with rice and baked/boiled broccoli, three little pigs which come with pork wrapped in bacon and potato cakes and fried chicken with Mac n cheese for our little one. Our 5 yr old loved the Mac n cheese and the fried chicken. The halibut special was good but the broccoli and rice could've been a little more well done and the three little pigs was delish. We also ordered an orange glazed tiger shrimp as starter that comes with salsa and avocado slices and it was good overall but could've packed a little more flavor in it. Our wines were pretty good and our server was prompt in checking with us from time to time. We didn't have to wait too long to be seated for a Saturday night.

No deals, limited menu, & a weird order at the bar served at the table system.This left us w/ a lot of traffic around the table, the wrong charcuterie tray served to us, & the feeling those working at this time are overwhelmed.

7/29/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Succulent has been my favorite eatery in the Santa Ynez Valley for the better part of two years. I generally love and crave their farm to table cuisine. My go-to menu item every visit is the caramel, bacon sundae. Imagine rich, creamy, McConnell's ice cream enveloped in blankets of thick caramel sauce, with generous chunks of smokey, candied bacon interspersed. It's heavenly! For dinner, Dave's Meatloaf is a definite win! Think comfort food to the max. Their pizzas are also nice. On our most recent visit we also tried their fried chicken and it was just okay. I was raised by a mother born and bred in the deep south, so I know good fried chicken when I taste it and their dish didn't come close. In fact, it was quite bland and flavorless, although it was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Speaking of bland, the smoked butter grits were the biggest culinary upset of all our Succulent dining experiences. With a description like ""smoked"" and ""butter,"" one would expect a hint of smoke, or maybe brown butter, or perhaps at least just plain butter; not here. I cook grits often and the grits they served literally tasted exactly like grits taste out of the box with nothing added; no salt, no butter, no milk, no pepper, no smoke, no flavor, no good. I took two bites, tried to dress it up with some S & P and that still didn't help. We could not eat them. What was most memorable about our most recent experience was the lack of cleanliness in the dining room. My napkin fell from my lap at one point during dinner and landed right next to a glob (the size of a large fist) of accumulated hair, dust, a dead bug and God only knows what else. It was very gross and we were one of the first reservations of the evening so one would think that the dining room had been cleaned right before. We also sat against a window where the inside ledge housed a couple of fly carcasses and the outside ledge provided us of a view of giant spider webs filled with dead bugs and random debris. Without any need to get further graphic, the state of the dining room from our visual perspective was dismal. I surely hope that management is paying closer attention to the back of the house to ensure it is clean, than they are to the front of the house, lest I find a hair ball in my salad or something!Service this time was just okay. It seems like their has been some what of a decline in service since adding on the new addition to the restaurant. I'm not sure why. During my most recent visit, I did not want to consume alcohol so I opted to order a ginger beer that was listed on their drink menu. I checked with my server first to ensure that it was a non-alcoholic beverage and she assured me, ""all ginger beer is non-alcoholic."" She then brought me a bottle and I took a sip. It didn't taste non-alcoholic. After reading the bottle I noticed that it had the same alcohol content as a beer. Luckily I am not pregnant, under 21 years old or in recovery, because if I was that careless oversight/mistake could have been detrimental. I did show her the bottle and she seemed genuinely surprised but no apology was made or offer to bring something else non-alcoholic instead, strange. It sat there, unfinished, next to the nasty grits.So all in all, I will return to Succulent again with hopes that my experience will be more like the days of old, when I could get a great farm to table, comforting meal with excellent service in a clean environment. Every place has their down day, at least this down was with a regular. I imagine this many slips with a new customer might not engender repeat business.",4 star rating,Danah W.

We were not disappointed. The friendliest server helped us and was so genuine and warm, it seemed like he had to be the owner.To start, they bring delightful petite biscuits with jam. We then shared:Blue Cheese dip homemade in adorable mason jars.Dave's BBQ MeatloafBacon braised brussel sproutsProsecco--- of course!They also do breakfast, which we are going to try the next time we are in town. It looks like they are also expanding and will soon have a tasting room next door-- can't wait!",5 star rating,Christie C.
5/23/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I've never associated Solvang with exceptionally good food, but Succulent has forever altered my impression of this Danish community. Ordered the charcuterie board (3 meats + 3 cheeses), as well as the scallops wrapped in bacon appetizer. Both were impressively delicious. The scallops with bacon were perfectly cooked, no rubbery scallops and no overcooked bacon. Thumbs up, for sure. The charcuterie board was not only visually beautiful, but also pleasing to the stomach. The cheese and meats were chef's choice, but whomever was cooking in the back selected well. However, my fave from the board was the truffle salami. Asked to purchase several ounces to take home, but they didn't have enough to last the Memorial Day weekend, bummer. Overall, had a lovely experience at Succulent Cafe Wine Charcuterie. Highly recommend when in the neighborhood.",5 star rating,Therese B.
9/18/2014,"Ventura, CA","The weekend of Sept 13th we headed up for my birthday and stayed in Solvang.We ended up coming to this lil gem for breakfast at the suggestion of a close friend. NOT a disappointment at all..  We got the special of the morning, which was their freshly baked biscuit, a Dutch Sausage smothered in gravy, with two poached eggs to compliment it.  We also got their cinnamon sugar pancake balls with the chocolate dipping sauce. WOW, what an amazing treat.  We are not morning people per'say, so eating a HUGE meal is not necessary for us, but the special was enough for both of us easily! and the sugar balls was just me being a princess on my bday but so happy I tried them, what a great experience.  I highly recommend.",5 star rating,Ambar B.
6/29/2015,"Oakland, CA","I thoroughly enjoyed this place! The meatloaf was tasty, the mashed potatoes were creamy and the tiny biscuits they served were outstanding!My girlfriend and her friend said the food was great but it may have been more catered towards a man's appetite. My boy and myself dug our dishes so maybe but if you love bacon and hearty dishes, this is a place to consider!The service is top notch! The ambiance is perfect. I especially loved their wall of wine bottles and how their bar is setup.  We had to pass up on drinks cause we were on our way out of town but their wine list looked pretty damn good! I will definitely return to this place for another tasty dinner!",4 star rating,Augusto L.
8/24/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is like yummy junky, comfort food made with the best ingredients they can find (but still an unhealthy place trying to pass itself off as health food).I had this flatbread, crispy pizza with the most delicious yellow tomatoes ever--I think it could have been phenomenal had they used fresh, real mozzarella.My boyfriend got this really good, different mac n' cheese with shrimp in it--I didn't think it'd work, but it did! It also had chorizo in it, 'twas good.We also really liked the complimentary biscuits served with the jam that I regret not purchasing a bottle of!This place is in between a 3 and 4 for me, and I probably would have done 4 stars if they used better cheese for pizza.  The service isn't great and the wait was pretty long even though we were the only ones there--we must have waited like forty minutes.I'd still come here again if I'm ever in Solvang, but I doubt I'll ever visit the tourist trap again.I do have to say that out of all the places we visited that day, this was the only REAL restaurant in that entire charade.",3 star rating,Cindy C.

We came right when they opened on a Sunday morning, so we were the first guests to be served. You order at the counter and then they'll bring your food to your table. I ordered the SHORTRIB HASH which had: peppers, onions, potatoes, pepperjack, two poached eggs, mississippi caviar ($12.50). This was DELICIOUS! The portion was large, and I couldn't finish it all (although I certainly did try!). The shortrib was moist and delicious and I loved the potatoes.After seeing Yelp photos, my husband ordered THE SUCCULENT PLUS (11.50) which had: cinnamon & cumin pulled pork, bacon gravy, pineapple chutney and egg. Everything about this meal was delicious, except he didn't' love the pineapple chutney. The sweet tasted off with everything else being so savory and delicious.The café is really cute, with wine bottles everywhere!

Was recommended to the succulent cafe by our toscana host so we both had what we like and to have a something to eat. It was confusing to figure out how the place works you have to order then have a seat can be inside or outside. We both got the bacon cheeseburger it was amazing but best was the garlic ranch dipping sauce for our fries.AMAZING!!!We never got asked by the employees if we needed anything or did everything come out ok they all bartender, waiters, and waitresses just passed by our table not saying one word to us. The busser Daniella was amazing she was very hard working and making sure everyone was well taken care of. Or if anyone asked her for anything she was on it and put the guest first... Very amazing great employee; friendly and understanding. I will definitely be back but hope to see her in a higher position that pays great because she deserve so much more for being so amazing and working so hard.

6/1/2014,"San Pedro, CA",This easily ranks in one of the top 3 breakfasts I've ever had.  Stopped in this morning with the missus.  It was my first time and her second time.  We were on our way back from Paso Robles.  First thing I see on the menu is Bourbon Vanilla French Toast.  Mother of God.  Bourbon Vanilla French Toast: This is easily the best french toast I've ever had.  They used some sort of cocaine laced French bread and are those pecans in the freaking syrup container?  Unbelievable.  Ordered the sausage as my side and was thoroughly impressed with it.Girlfriend ordered the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy with bacon.  Absolutely fantastic.  The breading on the chicken was great.  The gravy was delicious.  Biscuits were spot on. We also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes that were frigging amazing.  Crisp and crunchy Yukon Gold potatoes that were seasoned appropriately.Two coffees.  Coffee was good.  Not bitter and burned.Total came out to about $31.  I think that's a fantastic price for the scenery and food.  Looking forward to the next time we eat there,5 star rating,Michael K.

4/5/2015,"San Diego, CA","Some of the best flavor combinations I have had. We were looking for a late dinner after checking into our hotel in Solvang- this was the only one open and so we thought we would give it a try. Well worth the try! The Decor: Chic farmhouse with a rustic but modern vibe. Warm and crisp. Unique touches like led lights in a jam jar on the table make it feel that much more interesting. The Menu: Table appetizer for all- warm biscuits with home made jam. I could eat these for days- literally. Veggie Pizza- thin crust with a sweet and smokey tomato base, perfect with fresh mushrooms and crumbled feta. The base enhanced the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and the creamy cheese. So good. Cheese Plate- holy cheese! Wow, I can honestly say that this is the best plate I have ever had. Fruit both fresh and dried, herbed crackers and hard baguette slices. This along with fresh seasoned and marinated olives, cashews, and hand made orange preserves. I would like to eat this every day. The cheese was rich and high quality. Service: Our waitress was wonderful, answered all of our questions and helped us order quickly so that we could take it to go and enjoy in the room at our hotel. I would eat here every time I come to Solvang if given the chance. If you are looking for pure good fresh food that is naturally paired in brilliant ways to allow for full flavored bites- come here.",5 star rating,Dany W.

6/9/2014,"Porter Ranch, CA","My first dining experience at Succulent rates an easy five-stars.  No hemming.  No hawing.  It was a slam dunk.Details: I tried Succulent for the first time at dinner on a Sunday night.  My party of three did not have a reservation, so there was no space in the small dining room; however, we were offered an outside table (used primarily for lunch and brunch service.)  To me, this is the better option anyway.  It's Solvang: it's charming outside, and on a Sunday evening at 6 p.m. in June, the weather is perfect.  (One person who exited the dining room actually commented that it would have been better to eat outside; if this is an option when you go, I recommend it.)One person in our party had been to Succulent before for lunch.  She loved it and was happy to return for dinner, but apparently it's a completely different experience at lunch. At lunch, you order at a counter and then find your seat.  At dinner, the menu ""elevates,"" the dining room shifts, and it becomes a quaint, ""upper casual"" restaurant.For starters, our table ordered a chicken Caesar salad, a farmers market salad, a smoked onion and bleu cheese dip.  The salads were a hit and are served with bread-ish, biscuit-ish, dumpling-ish rolls that are warm and perfect.  The blue cheese dip - served with crackers, crostini and whisp of fried onion straws - was super decadent, spicy, and fantastic.  The serving size for $9 was generous, certainly enough for a table of four or five to share.Our main courses were:Dave's bbq meatloaf with buttermilk mash, peas & carrots bacon gravy, house made bacon {$22}   (The meatloaf is served atop the mashed potatoes, and a thick cut bacon strip is rested on top.)Buttermilk fried chicken with mac n' cheese, southern cooked greens, honey-mustard sauce {$24}   (The mac and cheese is served in its own bowl, topped with crispy bread crumbs. It's the kind leaves a stretched cheese strand trail from fork-to-bowl. Yes, please.  The greens were good, though not my thing, and the two chicken pieces were crispy and flavorful.)Three little pigs -- bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, creamed spinach, potato cakes sweet vermouth-pork jus {$28}   (Three mini-loins)We each sampled each others' meals, and to me everything was stellar.  The particular dishes we ordered happened to be comfort food staples, but the menu is quite varied and includes seabass, rack of lamb, beef tenderloin, scallops, duck breast, vegetarian options, raw options, pasta and pizza, not to mention several specials not listed on the menu.Succulent has a nice wine list, by bottle or glass, featuring many local wineries and some locally brewed beers as well.  Instead, each of us had a Bloody Mary - which is one of the reasons my friend wanted to return here after her first meal at Succulent.  It is crazy good - super spicy and packs a punch.  Note: ask for it served with bacon.  It's an extra $1, but you won't be disappointed.By the time the dessert course rolled around, we just couldn't eat another bite, so we passed.Everyone we met at Succulent was very friendly.  We appreciated being offered a table outside without a reservation, and they were kind enough to prepare our Bloody Marys though they are typically only a brunch offering.Great food and great service.  Again, an easy five-stars.Two things to note: 1) reservations are recommended at dinner, just to be safe, and 2) parking may be a little tricky - it's street parking only that I noticed.  Solvang is often crowded.",5 star rating,Jim D.

It's literally a variety of pickled veggies and meats, can't imagine if would take that long. He was not the friendliest of fellows either. Our meals were sub par and our appetizer was brought halfway through our meal. When they brought our drinks, they told us they might be too sour and he would water it down if it was.

4/17/2016,"Ontario, CA","I feel bad for giving them only 2 stars but after todays experience I was really put off and do not know if I will ever be back. About 9 months ago my wife and I visited Succulent and it was amazing. The food, drinks, and staff were great. My wife ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the short ribs and both were perfect. Our waitress really knew her wine and beer, which was nice as well. She recommended a red for my wife and a beer for myself that we both loved. With that experience in mind, my wife and I were driving back from San Fransisco (we live in Southern California) after our vacation today and we decided to plan our drive home around stopping in Solvang to go to our favorite wine bar (The Good Life) and restaurant (Succulent). We arrived in Solvang around 4:15 and decided to eat before we went wine tasting. We entered Succulent for dinner but were told by the host (who, in my opinion, was not very friendly or welcoming at all) that dinner/food was not available until 5PM. Apparently only happy hour is available from 3-5pm, which is drinks only from the description on the happy hour menu. We were perfectly fine with waiting until 5 to eat but did not want to order happy hour drinks before we ate since we both had empty stomachs, so we told the host (who seemed to not care) we would be back in roughly 30 minutes when dinner/food was available. We decided we would walk around and site see until 5pm rolled around. After walking the streets for a while we arrived back at Succulent at 4:55 so we could be seated for dinner. When we walked back in and told the host we were back for dinner, he abruptly asked us if we had reservations..........? #1, there was literally not a single person in the restaurant so I don't see why we would need a reservation, and #2, we had just talked to the host not 30 minutes before when we had previously walked in and he knew we didn't have ""reservations"". We humored the host and told him we did not have reservations and he looked utterly confused. After a brief pause, the host said that seating was available (duh, the place was empty). We sat down at 4:57 and started looking over the menu. At 4:59 our waitress came up to introduce herself and ask us if we wanted any happy hour drinks BEFORE dinner started since we weren't allowed to order dinner yet. I was once again confused and asked her if we could order dinner or not and she said we would have to wait to order. Mind you it was 4:59 and she's telling us we cannot order food. Literally she could have taken our order and by the time she walked over to the computer to input our order it would have been 5. Both my wife and I were irritated by the fact that they were refusing to let us order food even though they sat us and gave us menus, but we were hungry, and at this point wanted a drink since we had to ""wait"" for dinner to be available.  I proceeded to order a beer off their draft menu (Firestone Opal) and was abruptly told they did not have it anymore and that the menu was ""old"". I then went to order a beer off of their bottle menu (one of the Figueroa Mountain beers, I can't remember which one it was) and was once again told they didn't have that either..... Why have a menu then? I was starting to get irritated seeing that I had struck out twice ordering drinks and was about to just say forget it when the waitress said they had a special release on tap if I wanted that instead. I asked what the special release was and she proceeded to tell me she didn't know.....!! Really??? You don't know yet you offer it to me? She said she didn't know what it was but it was some kind of lager (she pronounced it lay-ger so obviously she had zero idea about the beer she's serving or beer in general), so I just said never mind I won't take a drink. At this point it was AFTER 5, we informed her we were going to skip drinks and just have water, and she said ok and just walked away...... Wait, couldn't we order food now since its after 5?? Apparently not. The whole point of that exchange was that we were not allowed to order food until 5 and then once 5 rolls around she just walks away? It's not like there were any other tables to attend to and the water was already at the table. We had had enough and just walked out. Between the host not being welcoming or downright nice and the waitress not knowing her own menu, having multiple items not available, and not letting us order dinner, I doubt we will be back again. We intentionally went out of our way on the drive home just to come back and enjoy another dinner from Succulent and it was a total flop. Very poor customer service from the host and the waitress.",2 star rating,Jeff T.
4/16/2015,"Santa Ana, CA","Stopped here after a long drive home from San Fran to orange county.  Yelp reviews made it sound promising, but my experience was not consistent with the yelpers. My fiancé  and I ordered the 3 and 3 meats/cheeses, three little pigs, and the pasta special.  I knocked down the first star for food.  The meat and cheese platter was beautiful but the meats seemed to all taste the same. (Maybe I'm not refined enough  to taste the subtleties). The cheese was good but I've had better.For entrée we both felt that our food was under seasoned.  It needed more salt and just lacked in the flavor vibrancy other yelp reviews had prepared us for.  We observed several other diners request and use salt on their meals so I would contest it's not just my personal tastes that were off.  Service knocked the other star off for me.  It was pretty slow getting service at our table.  Refills werent always ready, but they also weren't so slow that I had to track a wait person down.  It's in conjunction with the food taste that the service became more noticeable as well.Overall for what I paid for the meal it seems that it was overpriced for the quality of food and service.  I had better food in a bar the previous night. And the price for 2 people here was the same as for four people at the bar.  Overall, I would hesitate writing this place off, but I don't think I'd recommend it either.  Seems like there are better places to spend your money.",3 star rating,Adam C.

Brian is great to work with and the staff was so helpful, flexible, and friendly! The food was fantastic and all of our guests had an amazing time! The set up on the patio was beautiful.

7/21/2014,"Bakersfield, CA","I will start off by saying it was the best meal I have ever had in my 34 years on this earth. My fiancé and I got a late start on a Saturday and would not be arriving near Solvang till around 8:30 after a canceled hotel room (ugh!) and my fiancé surprisingly getting off work for the day, which I was super happy about!We managed to score another hotel in Buellton but wanted to hit up Solvang for dinner. We called at 7:50 and got an 8:45 reservation which was surprising because we were having a hard time finding any place open that late. We called about dress because we were not planning a fancy meal and I did not bring nice shoes (I had a nice pair of flippy floppies and a dress) they said it was fine.Onto the food: we had the house bacon wrapped scallops as a stater. O.M.G. Amazing!!!! We also had the artisan cheese plate which we got to feed to each other with different combos. Sadly my fiancé was better at pairing. But this portion of the meal was the best part of our two day trip. Extremely romantic!Our waiter was so amazing!!! I love wine and am picky and prefer sweet wines.  Sauvignon Blanc was the sweetest but he offered us ""off the menu"" moscoto which was soooo good! Pricey. Buy we were ready to splurge.Then our meal came. We had the duck with greens and the fried chicken with Mac & cheese. Half way through we swapped plates because I really wanted the Mac & cheese. We couldn't stop eating and rolling our eyes in pleasure.Then they offered desert which our stuffed foodie selves couldn't resist. The donuts with chocolate sauce.... Ohhhh must have! Being hungry is a side thought! Just go for it, you will not be disappointed!!!We are planning a trip here again in the future and are planning on trying the breakfast and lunch menu. It may be pricey but well worth it!!*Side comment to the idiot who knocked it down a few stars because he got there at 5 and demanded a table when the restaurant was empty. Take into consideration that they close the cafe at 4 and reopen for dinner at 5:30. If they are fully booked they won't seat your single ass at 5.",5 star rating,Gena G.
12/29/2014,"Atlanta, GA","So if you are vegetarian, don't go here.  My friend wanted to check it out so I sucked it up for his sake.  I got the veggie pizza of the day and it was burnt.  We got the feta and leek dip to start and it lacked flavor. Our waitress did not check in on us nearly as much as she should have especially given the fact that my $19 burnt pizza was barely eaten...get a clue much?!  My friends got meat dishes that were underwhelming.  Not sure why this place was highly rated.  Not exactly cheap and definitely seems like a tourist trap.  The eggnog crème brulee was good and tasty but ice cold.  Just odd food altogether and mediocre service at best.",2 star rating,Preeti C.

2/22/2015,"Colorado Springs, CO","We've been here at least a half dozen times for breakfast and lunch, and once for dinner. Although we were pleased with both the quality and service in the past, breakfast today was just not very good. All four of the poached eggs were solid with no runny-yolk goodness; the potatoes were obviously pre-cooked and reheated briefly, resulting in them being soggy; the sausage was not breakfast sausage, but spicy Italian sausage of the type normally found in lasagna or on pizza...okay, but out of place; the short rib hash was more like dry pot roast. The coffee, however, was pretty good. Any one of these could be overlooked, but *all* of them together confirms my prior suspicions that food quality has been waning over the two years we've been coming here. This is unfortunately the last time we'll come here for breakfast. I hope lunch and dinner haven't suffered the same decline, but my gut says it's a persistent issue.",2 star rating,Andrew E.

I wish we didnt.I got their cumin & pork belly sandwich. Albeit it was good, it came out drenched in the oil and fat. There was so much oil and fat that you could swirl it around in the tray and have it splash over the edges.My bf got their pbt (pancetta, basil, tomato). It was basically like a simple, little fancier BLT.My dad got another sandwich (forget which one) but he couldn't even finish half of it because they overdid it with the mustard.The only decent and enjoyable dish was my mom's thai beef salad.Yelp, you rarely fail me but this was a complete disappointment!",2 star rating,Sharon C.

I got the ""Succulent Biscuit"" which had a homemade biscuit, melt in your mouth pulled pork, gravy, and this pineapple chutney to die for. Everyone in my 8 person group was very satisfied with their meals. We also had amazing service, some of the best I've ever had. Our waiter, Allen, made sure we had everything needed. We also got a lot of help from Ernesto. Only thing out of the whole experience that wasn't flawlessly perfect is that we were all sweating to death from the heat....

4/21/2014,"Dana Point, CA","Easter Brunch was over the top good! High quality food, expertly prepared, and good service to wrap it up.Starts with a warm toasty cup of gourmet coffee followed by a trip to the SIDE buffet. Now this was not your full blown Vegas style buffet brunch one might expect on a holliday meal. No, this was a side buffet that was included with your entree order and could have been considered an appetizer but pretend the appetizer menu had ridiculously amazing potato salad, bacon, sausage, couscous, pear & candied pecan salad, scones, biscuits, muffins, and mixed fruit to top it off. Now if this doesn't begin to wet your pallet check your pulse you may be dead. After a healthy serving of nearly every item at the buffet we moved to the main entrees:Smoked salmon eggs Benedict on one of the most incredible buttery flaky biscuits that has ever graced these lips. Braised Short Rib Hash with stewed white beans, poached eggs, fresh salsa, and Melted cheese.Dungeness Crab Cakes with avocado salsa, poached eggs, and topped with hollandaise. All three dishes came with home style potatoes, but not the kind that are cooked on the grill that get mushy and soft. No no,  the kind that are deep fried first with the skins on and still have a great crunch and then they're just loaded with a savory salty flavor. And when that one perfect bite comes together with some of the poached egg yolk, hollandaise sauce, potatoes and meat, mouth-gasm is the only word to describe the pure unadulterated bliss derived from a bite like this. Bites like these don't come around more than a few times in one's life. You remember these bites for years to come and you tell yours about how good it was, you compare other bites to this one, as if it was the new standard of measurement for bite analysis. I must try when in Solvang, Ca.",5 star rating,Renier D.

11/2/2016,"San Diego, CA","Originally we wanted to have dinner in Santa Barbara but since we had to drive about 2 hours north from there to our hotel it just made sense to have dinner in Solvang. My husband found this place and the hostess was super attentive and sweet and tool our reservation for an hour later. We came back and sat outside. The weather was perfect. The bathrooms were nicely decorated. They have a wall with lots of bottles of wine inside and outside there are a lot of succulent plants. I also noticed they have blankets you can borrow when sitting outside in case you get cold. Our server was attentive. I wasn't expecting amazing food given that this is a tourist town and the word ""cafe"" was in the name. I was pleasantly surprised by the warm buttery biscuits and strawberry jam appetizer. Then we had the eggplant and tomato bruschetta with goat cheese, which was great. I decided to order the spicy hen, which is something I would have never ordered at a restaurant because I usually try to order steak and stay away from chicken because I often cook that myself. I really really loved the spicy hen. I am pretty picky when it comes to restaurant food because I know how to cook and have many great cooks in the family. This dish was perfect though, the chicken was not dry but it was thinly sliced and filled with cheese, sun dried tomatoes, basil etc. It came with a side of mash potatoes and veggies that tasted like they were steamed then baked. Both side dishes had a seasoning salt/powder that tasted amazing. Alcohol usually makes food taste better but I did not have any during this meal. I was so impressed that I asked my husband if we could come here on the way back!...My husband had the sausage pizza, he liked the toppings but not the crust. They have a large selection of wines. We were way too stuffed to do dessert.",5 star rating,Beth M.

Everything was better than could ever have been expected. As it turns out, our waiter Ty, had also waited on us last year.

The steaks were cooked to perfection, one at medium and the other medium well( it actually had a little line of pink running through it which is perfect!) they were tender and juicy and seasoned very well!

And honestly the woman at the counter was a little rude to our group of 2 to accommodate the group of 4 that arrived after us, and they were looking for the Sasuage restaurant a more down the way, maybe we should have left with them.

8/20/2018,"Long Beach, CA","I loved the atmosphere of this place.  I loved the idea of serving biscuits instead of bread while you're waiting on your food.  The biscuits were flaky and yummy.  I ordered the buttermilk marinated fried chicken.  It was served with macaroni and cheese and greens.  It wasn't very good.  There was a fatty layer underneath the chicken breast.  In addition to that, it wasn't seasoned very well.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit on the soupy side--the cheese sauce needs a little tightening.  The greens were good though they taste a lot like Glory greens in the can which isn't bad.  The greens and the biscuits were my favorite part of the meal.",3 star rating,Georgie S.

The employees were extremely rude when asked questions like ""where is the water?"" Apparently they were short staffed at NOON on a SATURDAY and no one had time to fill up the water tanks or offer to give us a cup of water. There was no silverware easily available, napkins were sparse,  condiments were almost empty, and the employees seemed really put out when asked for assistance. This was all on top of the fact it took about 40 minutes to get the food. And my PBT sandwich was just alright. (Bread tasted dry and kinda old, bacon was too tough).

I just would have hoped it was more seasoned.I was disappointed in the collards. I am a collards lover, and the ones that were served here were undercooked and under-seasoned, they need to cook at least overnight, and need a ham hock in them to give them the smokey salty flavor (which they did not have). The mac and cheese was delicious, but a little runny. The ambience is perfect for a late summer dinner. Service is quick, and attentive.

2/17/2014,"Orange County, CA","This is not only the best restaurant in Solvang, it's one of the best meals I've had all year. My boyfriend and I came here from Los Angeles for our 2nd Anniversary. We were hungry, so showed up for our reservation 45 minutes early and they were happy to seat us. However, the place is small, so they did turn away many walk-ins while we were there. Sit outside if weather permits. Our waiter was more knowledgeable about wine than in any tasting room in/around town and made us feel so special and welcome. I asked him if I should get the charcuterie plate or save room for dessert. He said it wasn't a question, take the charcuterie, they make all of theirs in house! He wasn't wrong! They even sent us away with a free celebratory dessert. We are fans for life!",5 star rating,Cheryl W.
3/13/2014,"Pasadena, CA","They've upgraded to a larger venue. One of the best places to get dinner at in Solvang. One hint though- the wine list isn't the best, so get a bottle next door at the Wandering Dog Wine bar to bring to dinner. Also, you're better off getting a reservation than you are just blindly walking in hoping you'll get a table, like we did. We had to sit at the bar (we took the last two seats). It was actually a good spot to eat dinner at. The food: The Charcuterie board- you can choose 2 cheese and 2 meats, 3 cheese and 3 meets and so on. We got the 2 and 2 and we were blown away! There was a ton of stuff going on on that board with pickled vegetables and delicious bread. It's such a good deal, it's ridiculous. We also got the bacon wrapped scallops- always a big hit. The scallops are pretty small, to be honest, but they pack a punch with taste. We also tried the crispy seared duck breast and the duck confit dinner. SO GOOD. My fiancé wasn't even hungry and he ate most of my dinner. The service is fantastic too! You can also buy things for carry-out since they cure their own meats and pickle their own veggies. Try this place!",5 star rating,Monica C.
11/19/2014,"Costa Mesa, CA","Delicious!  I dined here for dinner and loved everything I ordered.  The short ribs were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth good, the cheese plate came with house made savory jam, and the bacon + brussels combo cannot be beat!  I also love how the menu changes seasonally and they focus on using local ingredients.Succulent also gets an extra star in my book for being so accommodating with my food allergies - the waitress was very knowledgeable and was sure to tell me what was in each dish to ensure I was able to eat everything.  Much appreciated.If you are ever in Solvang be sure to check this gem out!",4 star rating,Allison H.

This year we brought our friends to Solvang to dine at SC and we were met by a nice hostess who promised us a table within 20 - 30 minutes. When we got back after 20 minutes she told us that the SC was fully booked for the evening. I reminded her of her promise, then she started to rant on about other restaurants in Solvang. The extremelly unprofessional and bad service left us with a new view of the establishment - not a great one...",1 star rating,Benjamin S.

Our group came here after a morning of wine tasting and this place was just what we needed. My husband ordered and tuna salad, and I had the Succulent bacon burger which was HUGE! The burger was cooked medium rare to perfection, and was very well seasoned and flavorful. For the group, we ordered the cheese and meat plate (I completely forget what it's called) and it was full of variety - from goat cheese to olives, the plate had a little of everything. The service here was extremely helpful, and we will definitely be back the next time that we're in town.",5 star rating,Christine P.
2/18/2015,"Fair Oaks, CA","This gem of a restaurant is on the main drag in the kitschy town of Solvang.  It is surrounded by some really awful places to eat.While I'm not hugely excited about ordering at the counter, this does make sense for lunch as it speeds up the process.  They bring your food quickly, which is nice when you are short on time.  They do, however, offer table service for dinner.Enough about that, let's talk about food.  Outstanding.  And filling.  This is not the place to go if you are dieting, or if you aren't too hungry.  This is the place to go if you want to feel really satisfied and happy.  Lunch specials vary, and I have never been disappointed.Forks up for both lunch and dinner.My one complaint would be about the parking.  I wish the city would address this so we could visit more often.",5 star rating,Cheryl K.

They brought out two slices on a small plate after I brought it to their attention....wierd.  Okay....food... the three pigs were bland and luke warm at best.  Wifes chicken in her salad was dry, leather like with zero flavor.

12/31/2013,"Oxnard, CA","An important thing for new customers is that you probably NEED reservations.  The first night we tried to go, there was no room, so we made reservations for the following evening.  During our meal we saw perhaps twenty disappointed people turned away.  It was a little sad, especially since many of them were clearly out-of-town (out-of-country) tourists who didn't seem to have an idea of where to try next.  The whole thing could have been handled more pleasantly and professionally. We were seated next to the door.  Before we sat I asked if we could sit at another table so we wouldn't get ""blasted"" with cold air, but the hostess said it wasn't possible because the open tables were four-tops.   Within 3-4 minutes, two two-tops opened up (and remained unused for well over a half hour).  It would have been so kind for her to re-seat us.  I considered asking, but since I was feeling a spot of friction, I didn't want to risk spoiling the evening. Buttery/oaky chardonnay is my favorite.  I asked our waitress if she had anything of that nature, and she recommended the most expensive -- Badge.  We opted for a bottle.   The chardonnay was decent, but certainly not what the type we'd asked for.  That night I looked on the winery's website and saw that it was fermented in stainless steel -- which couldn't possibly give a buttery taste.  To make matters stranger, an entire bottle was selling online for $12.50.  Succulent Cafe was selling one glass for $14.  I'm all for merchants making a healthy profit, but not taking advantage of customers. My husband had the meatloaf, which was average.  He gave me a bite, and I didn't finish it.  My butternut cannoli came with sauted greens, which were delicious.  The pasta was a little doughy.  The most delicious thing that evening was the free biscuit bites, served with a spot of jam.   They were warm and wonderful. Sometimes you leave a restaurant thinking well, it wasn't that great this time, but I'd like to try it again.  This one....hmmmm...no.  Sorry to say.  At least not for dinner.",2 star rating,Deborah G.

Nonetheless, it was still great! The salad was so fresh with lots of great flavors. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and thoroughly enjoyed it! I stole some of his fries and they were delicious. They give you biscuits with jam as an appetizer. The biscuits were stale. It was also quiet in there, you could hear everybody's conversation.

1/8/2014,"Laguna Niguel, CA","A MAJOR pet peeve is when the amateurs start dinging restaurants for trivial items like a long wait, a drafty table, high prices.  Seriously? I thought we were here to rate food and service? I agree, ignore Deborah G and her 2 stars. To her I say, if you're not eating at Denny's, MAKE A RESERVATION. You're not Anthony Bourdain. LOL!  Or Charlie S with his sticker shock. I challenge him to find any upscale dining establishment that would offer a rack of lamb under $28 or a Charcuterie plate for less than $22. The pricing here is spot on if you're familiar with higher end dining, especially in Solvang and the Central Coast areas.  The food here really is 5 stars. I had a delightful dinner meal and experience here with my BF. Had a reservation, was greeted and immediately seated by a friendly hostess, and attended by a mature and knowledgable server. Very romantic and cozy inside. I had the pork belly and it was divine: crispy fatty edge, moist and melt in your mouth meat, nested on spicy white beans and light brothy sauce.  My BF had the 3 little pigs: 3 slices of stuffed pork tenderloin, wrapped in bacon.. Now that dish was a culinary experience! I actually made something similar for Thanksgiving last year. Big hit!  Nothing better than pork on pork action. The tenderloin was prepared perfectly moist and the flavor not too intense to compete with the house made bacon. Bravo!",5 star rating,Michelle S.

The fries had the perfect texture--crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside-- and the grilled cheese had an audible crunch. Everything had the perfect texture.

7/31/2016,"Santa Rosa, CA","Pros: pretty nice setting. Indoor and outdoor seating. Attentive and friendly staff. The food is good and for Solvang not overpriced, although in a different location a dinner for two shouldn't be close to 3 digits without even having wine. Still for this tourist town I'd say it's mid pricerangeCons: Caesars salad is tasty and plated very pretty, yet too little sauce, mostly due to the way it's plated. Offering a little sauce on the side would help. The scallops from the starter menu are excellent, no con there. The duck on the other side was overcooked and a little too dry. The chefs obviously can cook since the scallops were spot on and scallops aren't easy, so using the same care for the duck would be an improvement. The sides - forbidden rice and cauliflower - are ok. Nothing fancy but well cooked and properly seasoned.Overall a solid experience and with the duck properly cooked it could have been a 5.Everything is plated very nicely and dare I say fancy, which is a bit in contrast to the rest of the setting and table decoration (I.e. The silverware comes in a mason jar, yet the salad is on fancy plates). Maybe those contrasts are what they're aiming for. Definitely a place I would recommend or visit again.",4 star rating,Uwe S.

My 3rd entree choice, the lamb burger, was good. Agree with another reviewer's comment about way over bright lighting ..

We had heard and read so much about the Charcuterie so of course had to order the 2+2.  It was way to much for the 2 of us, but we made a valiant effort. Sliced duck, bison salami, gouda and goat cheeses, pickled vegies and these yummy bread crisps.The wine list is small but you don't always need a 23 page wine list.My husband had the Sea Bass and I had the pork belly.  Both were superb. There are so many dishes I wanted to try!And for the service....there was a group of 6 that were seated next to us after we had been seated that were  very loud.

It did have a nice ham flavor.If we return to Solvang, we will definitely be coming back here! After lunch, we tried Aebleskivers at a local diner and checked out a number of other eateries and were so glad we had this tasty lunch. This place is clearly a cut above the rest.",4 star rating,Beth G.
10/31/2017,"New York, NY","I really love it here. Have been here both times I was in Solvang. The most recent visit - Was so sad that it was closed my first night I was in town, so had to go night number 2. We walked in about a hour before closing and it was crowded! (Thursday night) we didn't wait to sit which was nice though. I got the basil gimlet which was delicious - so many of the cocktails looked yummy. We started with the artichoke and feta dip which was just ok - I wish it was creamier, but nonetheless we ate the whole thing lol. For my meal I got the fried chicken which was sooo good (had gotten it the first time too) crispy and cooked to perfection. It comes with mac and cheese and amazing collard greens. I'd also highly recommend the crispy brussel sprouts. I would say if you're in Solvang, THIS is the place to eat. Outside of the food, the ambience is very cool too and there's a bar area. On a warm day, sit outside to see the beautiful sunset.",4 star rating,Ali C.

8/22/2013,"Portland, ME","I am not sure if it just breakfast that is terrible, but I really do not want to pay for another terrible and overpriced meal in order to find out.My husband and I were visiting Solvang and EVERYONE told us we have to go to Succulent. So, we decided to try breakfast, because tasting the biscuits and bacon gravy seemed like a good idea.That is what my husband ordered. Biscuits and bacon gravy with a poached egg (because that is the only type they make) - fine. I ordered the spinach Benedict. It was about $30 for breakfast.We were going to sit inside but the varnish smell was so overwhelming and sickening that we decided to go outside. Where all of the bees were. It was really about waiting 30 minutes for our food, swatting away bees and flies CONSTANTLY and getting cold, nearly inedible food.It was pretty bad. My Benedict was soaking because they didn't squeeze out or drain the spinach. The poached egg was cooked nicely, but there was no flavor. Not from the hollandaise, not from the biscuit. Which were so gummy and dense, we were convinced we were eating raw flour. My husband barely touched his food. SUCculent for sure, but emphasis on the SUC.",1 star rating,Laura M.
4/24/2014,"Carlsbad, CA","We really stopped in Solvang in search of some nordic gnomes (none found), but of course we had to eat at one of the highest rated restaurants for lunch.  We ordered at the counter, and sat down in the adjacent air conditioned dining room that was verging on a cafeteria vibe.  There were none of the mason jar touches or succulent plants that other reviewers had mentioned, and the bartender studiously ignored us and everyone else in the room.  I can see why others mentioned their preference for the dinner service.I can't believe I didn't order the charcuterie when it's even in their name, but HG pointed out that his Chef Salad was like the board on lettuce (really good dressing).  It must have had at least four kinds of meat and five chunks of cheeses, one of which smelled like dirty scalp, and came with some crostini. We saved a bunch of meat and cheese for later, and he was still too full to help me with my Succulent Bacon Burger.  I ordered it medium, but it wasn't pink at all - strange since it's a blend of meats including their bacon which is less saltily cured - great!  The consistency of the patty is just right, and you have to squish it down a little to get your mouth around it.  It doesn't need any of the $1 add-ons (better not at $13.95), but the caramelized onions might be a good substitution for the shaved red onions that left strings hanging out of my mouth.  The fries are as crispy as advertised.  I also had the Daily Ade, blood orange, can never resist that - so intense that we both needed a water chaser.  The counter girl said there were no refills on iced coffee, so HG just poured his hot coffee over a water cup of ice, and drank as much as he wanted.... we've never run into that before!I think we would have enjoyed a five star experience if we had nabbed one of the few shaded tables on the front patio, the staff had seemed a bit friendlier, and if more of the menu selections had appealed to me.",4 star rating,Nancy L.
1/2/2014,"San Jose, CA",I recently stopped here for lunch with my family on our drive up from LA. I ordered the roasted root vegetable salad and tomato basil soup. Both were wonderfully delicious!

We sat outside and enjoyed the warm December sun. I highly recommend this place for lunch!-L.,4 star rating,Leeann C.

9/24/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","We ate at Succulent for dinner on Labor Day weekend. They were busy, but still had last minute reservations available through OpenTable. We ordered the 3x3 cheese and charcuterie board, which was delicious and came with a relatively large selection of aaccompaniments. It was more than enough for me and my husband to share. We also ordered the artichoke and feta dip, which was just ok (probably wouldn't order it again). They had a good selection of local wines. And they provided heat lamps and blankets for those who were dining al fresco in the chilly evening. The restaurant is right by the big windmill in the center of town.

The feta and artichoke dip we ordered as an appetizer was delicious....and something I intend to try to make myself at home. For main dishes, we tried the duck and sea bass - both really tasty. Service was pretty good also, especially considering it was a busy Saturday night. I would definitely recommend Succulent as a great and central dinner spot in Solvang. I'd also recommend making a reservation on weekends as we saw people without one being turned away.",5 star rating,Emma A.
8/18/2013,"Solvang, CA","Being locals we don't often go into Solvang on a busy Sunday for brunch, but we decided to play tourist today. When succulent first opened we tried their lunch and weren't impressed, but the restaurant was brand new so didn't want to judge based on that experience. They stop serving breakfast at 1:00 according to yelp, so we got there at 12:20, but didn't get our food until just after 1:00. They were busy and let us know it would be a half hour wait,  but we figured it would be worth it because of all the great reviews. My husband got the fried chicken biscuit and it wasn't awful, but it was surprisingly bland. Not what you would expect from a meal with fried chicken, bacon, gravy, etc. He actually was adding salt to it, but it had way too much pepper. I've seen other reviews here saying similar things. As for me, I got the breakfast special, biscuit with home made sausage, cheese, and poached egg. When it came I could tell just by looking at it the egg was overdone. I went to cut into it and it was stone cold and hard boiled, not poached. When I asked for a fresh one they said they were 'out of poached eggs' and asked to make me a fried one. I was totally confused. But my food was getting cold so i got an over easy egg that needless to say, wasn't nearly as good. The waitress, who knows me, let me know that she explained to the chef I was 'picky'. So I guess when you spend over $30 for a mediocre breakfast that ends up being cold because the chef doesn't know how to poach an egg that makes you picky. Long story short: long wait and disappointing :(",1 star rating,Shawn D.
7/11/2013,"Santa Rosa, CA","GOD, THE FOOD HERE IS SO GOOD!So why am I giving it 1 stay you ask? Well, this was my go to spot when friends/family was visiting the area, but that relationship has come to a close. The last few times I've been to this establishment I've ran into some serious roadblocks...I'm only going to focus on 2 visits for the sake of writing too much, so here goes:Visit #1: Both me and my mom found multiple hairs in our food that matched the color of the guy cooking the food. We brought the hairs to the attention of the staff quietly and were offered for the meal to be compensated, we declined, no one has died from eating a hair right? Plus the food has always been on the up and up, so no biggie.Visit #2: Its a busy Saturday and we bring some out of town friends to eat a lunch...we wait in line, wait for an open outside table, then wait for our food to show up, we are starving at this point...the magically our food finally shows up! We are oogling over it, eating bits of each other's plates...and then BAM - ""EVERYONE STOP"" says one of our friends. She then picks up a piece of cornbread crouton from a salad we were all picking at...MOLD, ALL of the cornbread was horrendously moldy. Again, I quietly bring it to the management's attention...and most places would compensate the entire meal considering how unappetizing it is to find mold on something you've already eaten. - they only compensated the single salad.So with all that said, probably won't be coming back.",1 star rating,Chris S.

11/9/2014,"Los Olivos, CA","This is a casual dining restaurant. Don't expect full service. Many of the tourists seem to go to more of the tourist traps than this restaurant. Which means that you can usually find a seat in this restaurant.  However the food here is really good. My wife and I went there for breakfast and had the country fried chicken and gravy biscuit. The biscuit is about 4 inches in diameter it comes with bacon and fried chicken and then there's also gravy included. Everything tasted homemade and fresh. The gravy had a slightly smoky flavor which was very delicious. The serving size is plenty large enough for anyone and probably larger than most people can eat. However the food is very delicious and I enjoyed my breakfast. My wife had the french toast which I thought was good.  She didn't like it as much because she felt the nuts or pecans were out of place.  I liked it however.  My wife loved the meal I ordered and will getting it next time.We had our kids with us and they got donut holes.....they were happy!I would say that this place could likely attract more tourists if they got rid of the ""deli"" style ordering counter.  There seems to be a hipster movement in food lately were they downplay the dining atmosphere even though the food is fantastic.  For breakfast you order at a counter and I've seen some toursist women come in, look around, and walk out shaking their heads.  Likely they want to be able to have a nice breakfast with nice surroundings before they leave town.  They do have a nice dinning area, but they don't really highlight it. I would make the deli counter more attractive, displaying better meats and cheeses, and then have people come in and sit and wait to be served rather than order at the counter.  Just a thought. I love the food! Lot's of smoky flavor, rich dishes that aren't traditional or bland.  Just wish the decor was better and had a ""crisper"" look and vibe.",4 star rating,Eric A.

Instead, she made the experience begin on a dull note. I knew about the biscuits and jam because of other yelp reviews, but I had to ask for them and we didn't get them until we got our meals, which was a bit confusing to me. Are they supposed to be appetizers, like a bread basket type of thing? Other than that, the food was amazing. I really enjoyed the variety of cocktails -- the apple cider prosecco one was my fave -- and the three little pigs entree is a definite must! The salmon dish was a bit blah...the confetti rice showed up the fish which isn't a good sign. The jumbo prawn appetizer special they had was really good, but a bit pricey and could have used more sauce. All in all - very delicious and would go again :)",4 star rating,Bobbi B.

Gravy was cold and for a place that has a plethora of biscuit dishes, they were less than impressive. My Arnold Palmer was 1/2 pure lemon juice concentrate and 1/2 unsweetened tea.

1/8/2014,"La Habra, CA","Look, there is a pig sitting in the middle of Solvang! A succulent pig logo that is.Yes, all you need is to look for that logo. But before you head to Solvang and decide to eat at this restaurant, make sure you call ahead and get a reservation. This cafe gets packed easily and my guess is almost all of the customers eating in have reservations.Start with a 2+2 charcuterie. Don't let the numbers fool you. It is A LOT of food. The quality meats and cheeses were superb. If you are in a big party, pressure someone to order a 2+2 so that you could try it (that's what I did).The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth goodness! If I would go back, I would definitely order this. This is highly recommended for first-timers.I ordered the lamb chops (medium) and my take is that it was just okay. The meat had the right lamb-y flavor and not gamey. Medium was well...perfectly medium and they did not mess it up. I just thought it lacked something flavor-wise but I could not pinpoint what it was. Still good but not mind blowing good.They have local draft beer.. 805 and the like. Their wine selection is also extensive.A nice, eccentric gentleman also approached us and had a small talk.

Creative and delicious! And wanted it to become a family destination favorite.1 1/2 hours before our scheduled reservation, we received a voice message canceling due to repairs. When I called to get some help and understanding to what just happened, the message said closed for repairs since July 14, over 2 weeks ago!When we arrived in Solvang, I went to Succulent and  was greeted by one of the new partners, who could not have been more understanding, and let me rant, than helped me regroup.She recommended her fav resturant, besides S, and promptly made reservations and got us Seated with her fav waiter. Okay, the incident was not professional or at the least courteous, but its how we resolve the road blocks we come across them,  that separates us from everyone else, and this was proven last night.With grace and humility the evening was wonderful, we ate at Trattoria Grappola ( see yelp)BUT will make a special trip to Solvang to enjoy Succulent when it reopens!It is STILL one of the best meals we have had and the memory lives on!",5 star rating,Deborah S.

The staff was very accommodating and really helped us out (we had our toddler with us at dinner) I loved the rustic feel and friendliness of the place.

11/23/2016,"South Lake Tahoe, CA","Would love to be able to write a review of the food but we are still waiting for the food to come more than 40 minutes after ordering.  It is understandable that restaurants get busy but for a casual establishment where you walk up to a counter to order one would expect to be warned of such a delay if it was going to take such a long time. Bad service = bad review, regardless of the quality of food!So...the food came out just a few minutes later and we gave the server some strong, but respectful, feedback with out displeasure and lack of communication on wait time.  As we were ending our meal the manager came out and indicated that the server had told him that we were upset. He apologized and indicated that they were unexpectedly slammed and were not staffed for the lunch crowd (which seemed odd since it is the day before Thanksgiving holiday).  He said that he had just instructed the staff that they needed to alert guests of the wait time before they ordered (that's a nice real-time adjustment). He also offered us a complimentary coffee or glass of wine. Although we were not looking for comps, it was a nice gesture and my wife did accept the coffee.   By the way, the food was excellent and I can understand that someone could have a very nice experience here and give a much higher rating, which for their experience may be justified. That said, we had a one star experience. I hope that yours is better.",1 star rating,Scott M.

It's like a fast casual where you order inside and they bring you the food (coffee is help yourself). Ordering was easy and the food came out in a timely manner. I had the French toast and a side of scrambled eggs. French toast was a baguette which was really good, not too soggy just right with tasty maple syrup. The scrambled eggs were so fluffy and done just perfectly. I know they are just eggs but we've all had dry scrambled and these were moist and fresh. My wife had the plate with poached eggs and she loved it. Price was reasonable for a tourist spot but worth it. Everyone was super nice and helpful. Would definitely return back and maybe try lunch or the wine side.",5 star rating,F B.

I will definitely go back next time I'm in the area.",5 star rating,Rebecca B.

So we decided to give it a try and we're glad we did.  They give you a mini bucket if complementary mini biscuits with strawberry orange marmalade jam. YUM YUM. We ordered the eggplant tomato with fresh herbs over whipped chèvre cheese appetizer with a warm mini loaf of fresh baked French bread.  One word:  Awesome.  Then we shared the pizza special of the night which was a spicy chicken with pablano peppers and sweet pineapple. May I say we didn't leave a single crispy crumb on the plate.  I will close this review with ""you gotta go"".",5 star rating,linda c.
7/7/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Succulent just never ceases to amaze me.  By far it's one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and I must admit it's one of the reasons I keep coming back to Solvang.  The chicken and gravy biscuit is the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth.  That batter is just super addicting.  I've had a chance to eat it over the years and I have to say they've really learned how to refine and perfect the dish.  The seasoning is salty and spicy and the gravy I could eat as soup.  I loved it so much I ordered one to take back to the hotel for lunch and stopped here again before leaving town to take one home.  I am deducting one star and only 1 star because I decided to go there for dinner based on my love for breakfast and was extremely let down. The food for dinner is amazingly subpar.  The duck was chewy, the skin not seared.  The bouillabaisse tasted like it was microwaved and totally bland.  I would never come back for dinner but sweet jesus you can't stop me from coming back again and again for breakfast.",4 star rating,Kim T.
3/9/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Succulent Cafe food was excellent ! the only place I will recommend for other visitors of Solvang who want good quality food by excellent chef. However, their service quality is decreasing significantly after the expansion. Lack of emphatic towards customers, can't order take out anymore and this happened to my family twice in separate occasions. So sad to see how they change their service attitude. Before the expansion we could call in to order, they even prepare picnic meals for you though they were closed. Too bad, we won't be coming back.",3 star rating,Madrim K.
8/14/2015,"Concord, CA","Amazing food, fast seating/service! We stopped by for dinner in this Danish town. We were seated immediately for dinner without reservations. Dining was outside, perfect for hot summers in this tranquil little town. As a wine collector, I recommend their Rhone blend (glass -$14). We were served immediately with biscuits and yummy jam (free snack). I love pickled veggies and we ordered succulent veggies relish (fresh and pickled carrots and asparagus, pickled cucumbers, cabbage, and strawberries, and fresh peppers with fresh blue cheese and ranch dips. My husband ordered short rib. According to  him, ""the short rib was soft and literally falling apart, it. Was the perfect balance of smoke to fat... The smoky grits sealed the deal."" I ordered grilled duck breast with buttermilk mash and caramelized onions. The duck was cooked medium- medium well, very tender and went well with sweet jam. The wait for the main course after the starter was about 5 minutes. I highly recommend this place for its atmosphere, customer service (very friendly), speed of service, and food.",5 star rating,Yuliana G.

It also came with fries and they were average. The meal cost me about $13. You seat yourself and there isn't anyone attending to you and there is bar in the seating area but it was very confusing asking them for drinks if you wanted water or coffee because they would send you to the front.

A couple weeks ago, I was craving their Succulent Bacon Burger (my favorite thing to get!) and walked there after getting off work with the intention of bringing the burger home for my dinner. Well, I was not aware that they don't really serve dinner until about 5:00, and I was there a little before 4:30. But their food is so worth it to me that I was totally happy to just wait outside until they started serving for dinner. Well, one of the hostesses that had been coming and going getting things ready for dinner actually went inside at one point and asked if my order could be placed since I'd been standing there waiting, and I was allowed to place my order ahead of the normal dinner time. The burger came out perfectly as always!! I'm always really pleased with the service there, but even more so now after that day!",5 star rating,Lia C.

But it was only a tiny portion. I think it's not supposed to be a full meal. The Grilled Vegetable Sandwich was bland and oily! The bread wasn't good; didn't taste like anything. Other than that, the other vegetarian option on the menu is grilled cheese. I don't understand the good review. I guess they must come from meat eaters.The service is good though. We sat at the bar inside and I felt like it was missing some decoration.. it wasn't cozy as I expect restaurants in Solvang to be.We spent around $20. Too much for the overall experience and I left the restaurant hungry. If you are vegetarian, I'd no recommend the place.",1 star rating,Ju L.
8/24/2015,"Effingham, IL",We were only in town one night and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We picked this place because of the amazing reviews. When we sat down and looked at their menu I was quite surprised at the lack of options and even more surprised at how proud they are of their supposed gourmet succulent food. I ordered their daily pasta and the only word that doesn't need a facial expression to deliver how awful it was is bland or watered down. The brussel sprouts were charred and flavorless. The Cabernet tasted like it came from someone's bathtub. This whole meal was just disgusting. All in all my stomach is still empty and now so is my pocketbook.,1 star rating,Kristy J. A.

Despite the fact that it was freezing as soon as the sun went down, the food was so good, we didn't even care. We started with the chèvre and tomato confit bruschetta, which was very good. At the recommendation of one of the waitresses, my husband and I both had the meatloaf with truffle mashed potatoes. It was so delicious!!! The homemade biscuits and fresh plum-mint jam were also tasty. On top of the excellent food, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I asked about the daily-ade and they brought me a sample without my asking. It was green-apple lemonade-very refreshing for hot weather. Our waiter also offered us a table inside as soon as one opened up. We don't live in the area, but we'll be back!",5 star rating,D S.

1/8/2019,"Hermosa Beach, CA","Wish I had more good things to say about this place but the service was so bad. Let's start with the positives: The pulled pork sandwich was delicious, the charcuterie board was impressive, looks small but you get enough for 4 people and has great variety. Cute place and clean bathrooms for being busy.  You have to order at the counter and they deliver you food in the dinning areas. Now the negatives which may not be the norm but it stood out to many in the restaurant. In line to order at the counter which was about 10 people deep. There was about 3-4 people behind the counter but only one person taking orders and grabbing pastries while the others stood talking with their arms crossed. It took 30 minutes before I could place my order. Once we were at our table an received our food we asked for napkins and side plates but they never came. So we got up and asked the bartender who then rolled her eyes and  told us our server should get it. We explained that we did that already and she handed use 3 paper napkins and 3 plates, there were 4 of us, we asked for one more setting and she huffed and sucked her teeth when she  handed it to us. We didn't allow the bad service to ruin our meal and chalked it up for them being busy and overwhelmed. Went for breakfast the next day, not as busy same rude service.

11/20/2015,"Madison, WI","This was such a great find. We were next door at the Solvang Brewing Company having a beer and trying to figure out where we would eat on our first night in Solvang. We had walked by Succulent earlier and decided to give it a shot. First off, having a nice wool blanket to keep me warm outside was awesome. :)  The fresh biscuits and jam were delicious - the biscuits were flaky and the jam wasn't too sweet. We decided to get the 2x2 charcuterie board, the bacon-wrapped scallops and the brussels sprouts. The charcuterie board came first and they were great about accommodating our no-nuts request, and even came back to tell us that while they were mindful about giving us a clean board, etc., there was always the risk of contamination (it wasn't an issue). They were also great about explaining what each meat and accompaniment was. We loved everything on the board, including the pickled veggies and chutneys.The brussels sprouts were delicious - perfectly crispy and wonderful.But the star of the show was the scallops. We actually talked about ordering a second plate they were so good. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the bacon was not too thick and wonderfully crisp. They were topped with a tobasco aioli that was just spicy anought to add flavor, but not overpowering. We were super impressed all around - the service was great, the atmosphere was casual yet romantic. And we might just drive back down someday to get those scallops again!",5 star rating,Sara S.
5/8/2014,"Downey, CA","Unfortunately, we weren't able to give a full review because the one dish we wanted to try the Cafe was out of.  Several people came in looking for the fried chicken, specifically because they read the good reviews on yelp.  So myself and several other patrons had to settle.  This may be a good thing for the Cafe, but not for the customers.  Will still give it another shot, whenever I'm in town, and update my review if warranted.Update:  Received a note from the restaurant, which I truly appreciated.  Updated to 4 stars, because great customer service is crucial.Dear Charles,We do apologize for not having the fried chicken available. It is no way good for the Cafe to not have one of our staples available to our customers. Our chef and kitchen staff have been made aware of the issue and we hope to remedy any glitches in our ordering of produce & poultry so that we are better able to serve our diners.

5/29/2016,"Encinitas, CA","Looking for a great venue to host a private event in the area, start with Succulent Cafe.  My fiance and I looked at several places to host a welcome reception on the Friday evening before our Saturday wedding at Firestone Vineyard this April.  We wanted something easy for guests, great food and not a cookie-cutter banquet room.  We ended up renting out the inside of Succulent Cafe and my now wife and I couldn't have been happier with that decision. We worked with Brian, the restaurant's manager, to develop a food and drink menu that worked perfectly for us and our guests, a mix of meat eaters, vegetarians or just non meat eaters.  Brian developed a creative menu to please all our guests who still rave about the night.  The mini hamburger sliders were amazing as were the the bacon wrapped scallops- half ""non-wrapped"" for the non meat eaters.  A beautiful charcuterie table was also set in the corner with a  variety of meats and grilled vegetables and large salad of roasted beets with Humboldt Fog cheese.  The passed Fried Chicken breasts, charred brussell sprouts and purple cauliflower were also outstanding.I could keep raving about the food but want to highlight that Brian made the place accessible for us prior to the evening and it was set up exactly as we had talked about when we first met and over several email exchanges.  Flowers, etc were dropped off early and all placed just perfectly.  In the end, he and his team did an incredible job on what could be a stressful night.  My wife and I spent the entire night having fun with our guests and not having to follow-up on anything. We had just over 40 guests and the place felt comfortable and intimate. Huge,  Thank You to the entire team and Succulent and Brian for making the evening so special.",5 star rating,Jonathan D.

The homemade mini biscuits they give you with jam are absolutely delicious. I ordered a beet salad and my mom had a Cesar which was lightly grilled- both salads were incredible. The goat cheese spread is heavenly and the tomato and basil bisque was so good! I love this place and can't wait to come back!,5 star rating,Ellen S.

No wonder there's never a wait here, everyone is at Paula's. Ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon and there was a pool of oil on my plate. The poached eggs were pretty much hard broiled eggs. Stay away!!! Never coming back!",1 star rating,Dilly D.
2/22/2016,"Woodland Hills, CA","I've visited this restaurant several times during my many trips to the Solvang area. The sandwiches I've had at lunch are very good. Came here with friends for dinner - large portions, very tasty, especially the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Smoked Meat Loaf, and the Bacon Burger. My charcuterie plate was a little skimpy considering the price. And while enjoyed the quality of food, somehow the total bill seemed higher than what we'd expected. And to be honest, the long intervals between seeing our server were probably because the place was packed, so service may be better during off-peak. Overall, one of the best food stops in Solvang, but expect it to be pricier than the casual environment would suggest, and try to avoid peak dining times.",4 star rating,R.C. G.
1/23/2013,"Marina del Rey, CA","AMAZING! As a bacon lover, the fact that this place is pork-centric truly resonates with me.  Beyond that, all of the food of was sensational.  We had a dinner reservation and enjoyed it so much that we had to go back for lunch the next day.  Highlights: duck prosciutto, cassoulet,  rack of lamb (you get 7 chops), stuffed chicken, bacon-wrapped scallops, charcuterie plate (especially the italian bacon), and the salted caramel bacon sundae.",5 star rating,Jim F.

This time it led me to the Meatloaf Sandwich which can only be described as- Amazeballs. I don't wanna say that this was better than my mama's, but it really was. My mom is a damn fine cook and hard to beat. So, give me a good hard slap if you hear me say it again about anything else.

Our server was Ericka and she was very friendly, helpful and attentive. What I appreciated from Ericka is that she quoted the prices of the specials, many places don't. We both ordered the specials, I ordered the lamb and my partner had the salmon, both were delicious. The cost of the lamb ($28) and the salmon ($25) might seem high for some but the quality of the food and portions made for a good value.

3/25/2014,"Valencia, CA","We had reservations but did not need them on a weeknight. In spite of not being very busy at all, their service was delayed/slow. Dinner menu is a bit pricey, but they are fairly large portions and a full dinner. Unfortunately, I wasn't tremendously hungry and was trying to choose something small/light. I ended up with one of their specials - pizza (more like flat bread) with broccoli and asparagus.  Supposed to be an ""individual"" portion, but there was more than enough for two very hungry eaters. My husband got the meat loaf which he enjoyed (but couldn't finish). Ordinarily, we enjoy leftovers, but these are difficult to hold onto when you are staying in a hotel without a fridge (or microwave). What we both REALLY enjoyed were their biscuits with homemade jam. I would probably go back there, but with very different expectations - and maybe better for lunch.",3 star rating,N N.
5/28/2013,"Sonora, CA","Excellent little place!  Foodies converge here. It was a beautiful day in Solvang, and we sat at an outside table.  Food was perfectly prepared. I had the pastrami sandwich, and it was flawless.  I do not give that high regard easily.  Meat was tasteful without being too fatty, pickled fennel was well-seasoned without being overly so, condiments were perfectly paired and the bread was crusty and chewy.  All the flavors complimented each other without overpowering one another.  Perfectly balanced!  I had the house salad, which was also excellent and well balanced.  What a great house salad instead of the boring usual suspects on a salad!My sister had the chix tortilla soup, which was delicious, and the buttermilk chicken salad shared with our friend that joined us.  It was enough food for two easily, and everything was masterfully done. This is not a full serve cafe, but the food was too good to care!I will go again without hesitation.  My only regret was not ordering earlier bc they ran out of Prickly Pear Lemonade right before I ordered.  So sad for me! Oh yeah, another sad one for me bc I didn't get to try the pork belly biscuit breakfast!  Next time.",5 star rating,Chelsea C.
12/22/2014,"San Diego, CA","My boyfriend and I walked in on Sunday night, they didn't have any tables inside because of reservations. We could wait an hour or sit outside, which we did. It was a little chilly, but they do provide blankets and heat lamps.Neat selection of beers and wine, no cocktails. We ordered the feta artichoke confit, which was tasty but a little too lemony, which is hard to avoid with preserved lemon. The goat cheese lamb burger was very good, definitely could taste the goat cheese. The veggie pasta was good but not very interesting compared with the rest of the menu. The little biscuits with jam were awesome,they were also good with the confit.Service was awesome, shout out to our server Ty! He was attentive without being too much and was very good at explaining the menu and helping us choose beers. Plus we liked his Converse.Minus a star for the food itself, which was good, but the veggie pasta was pretty uninspiring for the price. Five stars for the service and atmosphere.",4 star rating,Lynda C.
3/8/2015,"Irvine, CA","I'm really disappointed in this restaurant. I used to love coming here every trip I made up to Wine Country. But based on my most recent experience this establishment went from hero to zero. I have always raved about this restaurant to any friend and frequented it bringing friends with me but I was utterly disappointed this trip. The menu has changed and no longer has my favorite pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw, the bread was so hard it sliced a big cut into my face (hard enough to break a tooth), and everything was very spicy. There isn't the same variety in the food anymore. While the food was still pretty good, I no longer think it's worth it for the price. I used to be stuffed and be able to take the other half of my sandwich home with me. I finished my slow roasted pork sandwich and was still left wanting. A whopping $20 for a sandwich and a lemonade is pretty steep.",2 star rating,Lauren L.
10/4/2014,"Riverside, CA",Food was amzing.  Service was ok. Should have received a 4 star.

We didn't want to eat at any place that started with 'Bit of' or any other deliberate tourist spot, of which there are many.Instead, when we got into town, our first lunch was at the Succulent Cafe. From the atmosphere to the beautiful presentation, this is the place to go. The dishes are the likes of what you would expect in after hours dining spots in the city where the chefs go to eat. We were the only people inside while everyone else was clamoring to get a table at Ye Olde Sausages n' Things (or something like that).The chefs are younger which only adds to the fresh thinking and gorgeous presentation conveyed in the dishes. My only regret was that we didn't eat here for every meal.Cheers! We'll be back for sure.",5 star rating,J B.
3/15/2015,"Gardena, CA","This place was ok. A little over priced for the food. We got the braised short rib and the bacon burger. The Braised short rib was tender/fell apart but was on the dry side. In my opinion, the burger was over priced for the taste. However, The high-light of our night was the artichoke feta dip. I have to say that was amazing. Service was a little on the slow side, but understandable because of the small town. All in all, I think this place is all about the hype.

I enjoyed a Prickly Pear Lemonade - which was a fun bright magenta color - and would make an excellent margarita, as well as the BBQ Pork Tacos. I took one bite of those tacos and knew they were going to be the absolute best thing I ate all week. I will dream of them. The owners were incredibly friendly and helpful, and when I checked to see if I had ordered a side, they didn't even question and brought it out to me immediately. Impeccable service, and amazing friendliness. A little different than the normal type of food or restaurant you will find in Solvang, but super worth it.

Upon ordering your food, you are presented with their signature biscuits and house made jam, which are AMAZING! You will definitely be requesting 2nds or 3rds. I actually order the same dish every time because it's that amazing and I can't seem to get it off my mind when I'm there. The amazing dish I am refuting too is their ""Succulent Meatloaf dish"". If your looking for comfort food at its finest, then that dish is the way to go. I usually switch out the side it comes with and  replace it with their signature mac and cheese. The combination together will make your taste buds explode. The staff is amazing and the location is great! Right in the heart of Solvang with a great outside patio!

Dinner is in a half hour and we can have a drink and a nibble then have dinner. NOPE.  They seated us and never came back. Finally the Mgr showed up after we had been sitting for 20 min. and asked her if we were going to get water atleast. (OKAY, I would have left but the people we came with swore it was awesome) She said she would send someone over to get our order for drinks. A busboy came over and left water for us and never took a drink order. Finally one of the girls in our group walks up to the hostess and complains. They said do you want to order appitizers now?  NO. Dinner starts in 5 min. Too late.  OKay.....We order dinner.  $125.00 later.  4 waters, 1 diet coke (Nobody was intrested in drinking anymore).  2 VERY Small greens only salad, 1 bowl of pasta about 2 cups worth and 2 pizza that were a tad thicker than a tortilla with almost no toppings (their special).   I have no problem spending money but COME-ON.  I should have taken a  picture.  You would not have believed it.  I've had better meals and service at Chucky Cheese.",2 star rating,Beth R.

3/29/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","WOWOWI heard that this place was delicious and had pretty high expectations for this place, but this restaurant far exceeded my expectations. I think the name ""cafe"" is actually misleading. The food served here is definitely not what you would expect from a regular cafe with some good brunch menus, it is definitely a lot more than that. Instead of going to succulent cafe for lunch, my boyfriend and I went here for dinner and we were so happy that we did. Their lamb was DE-LICIOUS and their crispy pork appetizer was A-MAZING. The apple and onion that was caramelized went so well with the crispy pork belly. YUM   I had their ""catch of the day"" which consisted of seabass, shrimps, mussels, calamary and clams. This was also very very delicious. On top of their delicious food, the ambiance of the restaurant is also very cute so MAKE SURE YOU STOP BY AT SUCCULENT if you visit Solvang!",5 star rating,Anna L.

2/15/2013,"South Pasadena, CA","Uh. Mah. Gah. Go here. Get here as quickly as you can and indulge in any one of their biscuit sandwiches for brunch, and take some locally-made preserves home with you. The service here is stellar, and everything we tried was to die for. My husband had the pulled pork open face biscuit sandwich and I went with a classic: eggs benedict - both were served on the fluffiest, lightest buttermilk biscuits ever made. They let us try some of the espresso-cured duck breast prosciutto too, which was terrific. All of their produce and meat are locally-sourced, and they carry a wide selection of local wines as well. I can't speak to the dinner menu here, since we just had brunch, but if it's half as good as their brunch dishes, then you'll be a very happy diner :)",5 star rating,Maggie H.
8/10/2016,"Torrance, CA","We had the pleasure of eating dinner at Succulent Café during our recent trip to Solvang and so glad we did, the food and drinks were GREAT!  We were a group of five and we started with the shrimp appetizer and artichoke dip both were very fresh and flavorful.  Our drinks included red wine, IPA beer and signature drinks, there wasn't a dude in the bunch and my husband is a beer snob...he loved the IPA.  The signature drinks were very well made and all the flavors came thru without skimping on the liquor and dinner was WOW!  Our order included the Lamb burger, a bacon burger which I was told were the best they ever tasted; the fried chicken and mac & cheese....nothing left on the plate; three little pigs (I believe it was called) very tender and packed with favor and the stuffed chicken special was sooo good.  I wish we would have tried dessert but we were too full.  When you visit Solvang, this is a must try.  The service was wonderful.  We did not make reservations and were lucky enough to be seated right away.  I would, however, suggest making reservations.",5 star rating,Debbie L.

Lunch I had the eggs benedict with a side of potatoes, it came on a buttermilk roll that melted in my mouth. The hollandaise sauce was perfect ( in my eyes ) Dinner I had the meatloaf, Delicious. They came out with biscuits with a sort of jam ( not a jam fan but boyfriend loved it ) it came with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. UNREAL. Good wine selection, I only wish the place was bigger inside! I'm sure that will come soon !Servers are sweet and knowledgeable about all.

3/28/2014,"Temecula, CA","PROS: Food, wine selection, locationCONS: Pace of service, wait staff attentiveness, priceMy husband and I made 6:30 reservations for a Wednesday night.  We arrived 10 minutes early but were seated immediately.  The restaurant was somewhat busy, but not packed.  During our visit, the dining room never filled to capacity.  The hostess was friendly and welcoming which we took as a good sign of the service to come. However, once seated, it took about 5 minutes for anyone to come over to offer us water and it was another 15 minutes or so before we finally met our waitress who tried to rush off after taking our wine order.  We insisted that she also take our appetizer and dinner order as well.  I don't think we would have minded all the waiting as much if we didn't see waitresses and bartenders just standing around.  At times waitresses rushed by our table looking stressed out even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  It made us wonder what on earth was going on in the back of the house.After waiting about 20 minutes for our grilled Caesar salads to come out, someone that was not our waitress dropped off a basket of biscuit bites with homemade jam which were delicious.  When our waitress finally emerged from the back of the house, we asked her about our salads. She looked confused and then embarrassed and sincerely apologized for not putting in our order.I don't usually drink more than a glass of wine with dinner, but it took so long for the salads and entrees to come out that I had time to leisurely finish an entire glass before my food showed up.  I ordered another to go with my salad and meal.  The food was fantastic and nearly worth the wait, and while not overpriced, the poor service made it feel that way.  We both ordered the grilled Caesar salad, And for our entrees we tried the duck breast and the short ribs, and for desert the bread pudding with seasonal berries.  Our waitress, when present was polite, professional, knowledgeable, and engaging.THE BOTTOMLINE: The location was great; walking distance from our hotel and the atmosphere was casual, but not at the expense of making the place feel cheap.  The food was creative, flavorful, thoughtfully prepared, and cooked perfectly.   However, we are unlikely to go back based on poor service alone.  I would also like to add that this is the only time in our lives that either of us have ever left less than 10% for a tip; to us the service was just that bad.",2 star rating,Erica B.

To start, we enjoyed their bacon wrapped scallops which i can't say enough about and their brussel sprouts (probably my favorite veggie now, if I can prepare them the way they do). My bf ordered off their special menu selections - an herb risotto that came with a lobster tail. The lobster was prepared to perfection. I ordered the three little pigs - ohhhh emmm geeee - all I can say is delicious. I had a glass of cab which only added to the deliciousness. For dessert we had their bread pudding, I'll be honest, it is not the best I've had but it was good. I only wish it had been warm.

4/26/2014,"Vallejo, CA","I highly recommend Succulent Cafe for breakfast.  They have a simply menu, yet everything is tempting.  While visiting Solvang someone that grew up in the area suggested I try them for breakfast and bloody mary's.  I can live without bloody mary's but make a point to eat breakfast there one morning.  I had the poached eggs and potatoes breakfast - it is accompanied by a biscuit that without a doubt was just made that morning.  The poached eggs - well, suffice it to say that I have never before tried poached eggs quite that good. I truest the roasted potatoes were first fried but that's only a guess because they tasted anything but oily.So...why only a 4-star rating?  For starters, they don't open until 8:30 for breakfast - at least on Saturdays.  Given that most other places in the neighborhood open at 7, it seems a little late.  I arrived a little early, not knowing their hours and waited outdoors since I would be walking in the opposite direction of my final destination, otherwise.  There was a young lady who opened the door and informed me of the hours and was able to accommodate my request for a menu.The 2nd thing that I felt they could have improved on is that the young lady who handed me the menu was near the window at all times.  The patio is spacious but not so big that she couldn't see me sitting outdoors (in the cold).  Yet, when 8:30 rolled around, I noticed they hadn't open the door or come out to take my order.  It turns out they take the orders at the register and then deliver the food.  That's entirely acceptable, but I would have liked (and expected) that maybe she poke her head out the door to tell me they were open.Given the price point, I would have expected (at a minimum, liked).  Then I learned that I wouldn't be able to stay outside, if I expected to be warm, because they're heater wasn't working.I paid after ordering and eventually when the food arrived (in very fair timing), I learned that I needed to bring my own flatware and napkins to the table.  All of the condiments, etc., are in a central location.  The ketchup left in the one bottle was just enough for one person.  I will add that they do serve you the food and that walk around asking us how everything went.I feel that if you know all of this ahead of time: store hours, partial table service, etc., then your experience should undoubtedly be enough to push to a 5-star rating.",4 star rating,Maria H.

4/6/2016,"Denver, CO","The menu at this place looks amazing.  Like seriously, I wanted to try everything.  Now, not so much.Sit outside if possible.  They were full outside when I came, but it is a cute patio with lights and is calm and quiet.  The inside is not calm or pretty - it's loud and echoey and has zero style.I ordered a lemon drop cocktail (it was the best part of the meal).  I also ordered the soup of the day (broccoli) and the fish of the day (red snapper).  They brought complimentary biscuits to the table, which I was excited about - until I tasted them.  They were so bland that even the jam that accompanied them could not save their taste.  The soup was oversalted to an extent that even I, who love salty food, could barely eat it.  It was overpeppered as well, but I am fine with the spice, so that did not bother me.  It's too bad because I think the soup would have been very good if it had not been so salty.  The fish was the exact opposite of the soup - so tasteless that I wondered if they'd forgotten some of the ingredients.  The risotto that came with it was not creamy, but instead soupy.  At $29, it was one of the worst entrees I have ever had.It wasn't just the food that was disappointing; so was the environment.  I personally think restaurants that are not casual family dining (like Chili's and the like) should refuse infants after 8pm.  Succulent did not, and so my entire meal was punctuated, in a small, echoing space, by the deafening cries of the baby the restaurant had not turned away.  I understand people with kids want to go out to eat too - but I think after a certain hour, they should be required to leave their children at home so that people who have not chosen to have children (or who are out to get a moment's peace from their children) can eat in an adult environment.  Or, if the restaurant wants to accept them, it should request parents take babies outside who will not stop crying.  The baby screamed so loud at one point that the entire restaurant stopped talking and looked over at the parents who did nothing except send back their meal for tasting bad.  And still the restaurant did nothing.I usually stay at a restaurant for a couple of hours, ordering drinks and multiple courses, but here I was in and out in under an hour.  Everything about it was just so unpleasant (except the staff, they were just fine) that I preferred to head back to my boring hotel.If I gave this place another chance, I would order the charcuterie board (it's hard to screw those up) and make my reservation for an outside table.**Update for the comment from the manager**  Age discrimination is when people do not hire someone age 40 or over on the basis of their age.  Restaurants can refuse service or stop service for many reasons, including loud children not being taken care of by their parents.  There are restaurants, including some in California, that do not allow children after certain hours or warn parents that any loud noise from their children will earn them an ejection from the restaurant.  It was late, the child wasn't just a little noisy or intermittently crying - it was having a full on meltdown that hushed an entire restaurant full of people.  The restaurant chose not to do anything about it, I commented on it in this Yelp review, and the manager threw out ""age discrimination"" as if it somehow applied in this context, which it doesn't.  Screaming infant or not, the food was subpar.  The only thing the manager has done with his petulant (and legally inaccurate) comment is ensure that I won't give the restaurant that second chance I was planning.",2 star rating,Lauren M.

But if you can't grill it long enough to melt the cheese or can't tell the difference between basil and spinach, you've really just failed at making the most basic sandwich there is.",1 star rating,Adam N.

We arrived at 450pm and the hostess seated us. We were soon ready to order but we didn't see a waiter or waitress around.  So I told the hostess we are ready to order and the hostess told us dinner service won't start until 5pm. Why didn't she tell us when we sat down? I don't know. Appetizers and entrees were great, service was ok, but the deserts were terrible.",4 star rating,Aya L.

Later in the week I had the fried chicken dinner. It was so bland. I did love the greens. My husband had the short ribs and he said they were very good. Our server who was blonde came to our table so many times , at least four times,  it was difficult to have a intimate dinner. She was very loud too.",3 star rating,Claudia W.
1/6/2015,"Los Angeles, CA",Came in with my husband and two little ones on a weekday night. Only one other couple present. Service was excellent especially considering my kids. Wish the food was worth the price. My husband thought the buttermilk chicken was only slightly better than KFC. My cream of broccoli was okay but I have to say my own version is better. The little biscuits they served for free were actually the only memorable tasty thing. Also a complaint. Yes the portion might be largish but 10$ for a child' plate of cheese pizza with a small side of fruit and milk was $$$. At least they allowed to split the meal with plates and halve the milk for two cups. The gingerbread cookies the kids didn't like. Nor did we. Too strong ginger. But service was very good.,3 star rating,Johanna S.
9/3/2014,"Alameda, CA","I saw this cafè in west ways magazine. (Gosh, I'm getting old) So after a trip to our beloved Rideau Winery we stopped in and shared a sandwich and sides. Every thing was delish. The slow roasted pork sandwich was tender and juicy. The bread toasted and crunchy enough to handle the juicy sandwich, just to the last bite. We certainly took our time, enjoying the mostly serene patio. Traffic noise :(, Not too bad, our 19mo enjoyed an hour long nap. I can not really comment on the service since we used the cafe, and they just delivered it to our table. We went on a late Wednesday afternoon. I would recommend this to friends.",5 star rating,Sharon R.
4/30/2012,"Hermosa Beach, CA","WOWFirst things first, I did not actually eat INSIDE the cafe. I was having wine next door (by the way, YES there is a wonderful wine bar right next door) So this review is based soley on the food.I have always wanted to at least do a little drive through Solvang, and I got my chance this past March. I was driving from LA to Carmel. I decided to go the coastal route, but to drive in through Solvang and back along the coast again. I am so happy I did.This is a MUST. If I didn't live 4 hours away I would go there as much as possible. If you live 45 minutes away it is worth it! Alright, here's the good part:I was having wine at Valley Vino (5 stars as well) when I saw a waitress with two plates of heaven walk through the front door and deliver the gorgeous entrees to a group of women. I immediately asked someone about this. The man pouring my wine told me that the cafe and the bar have a bit of a deal with each other. It's PERFECT for the patron, in my opinion. He had a menu and gladly gave one to me, told me just to let him know what I wanted and he would go over and put the order in for me. I was floating already. All I ordered was a plate of hors d'oeuvre to go with my wine. This is essentially a plate full of little tid bits to snack on, like an appetizer. I was nervous at first that they were just pretending to be on the classy side by having a menu with a French influence, and I was almost sure that this small town cafe was going to come out with a cheesy ( no pun intended) platter with salami from a zip lock bag and american cheese. I was so wrong!There was a wonderful assortment of cheeses and meats complete with a few fruits and a quail egg. SO perfect for a wine night. If this is how they do with a simple hors d'oeuvre then I am POSITIVE their other dishes are as delicious as they look!",5 star rating,Ariel J.

Wonderful food.  The decor is charming, outside tables, extremely pleasant and attentive service (take note Root 246...this is how you serve good food).I had the PBT (Pancetta, Basil, Tomato) biscuit with an egg added. The pancetta was flavorful and crispy, the fresh basil leaves the perfect compliment, the egg small and the appropriate size for the biscuit...and, oh my, the biscuit was delicious. Slightly crispy on the outside, buttery and sweet. It wasn't large for the price, but the flavors were so rich that you really didn't need more for breakfast. For a larger meal, try their Succulent breakfast biscuit with pork belly, pineapple, and a very flavorful gravy. Very, very nice and very filling.The coffee was nice and refills were free. I really wish I hadn't spent $200 at Root 246 for dinner which was awful (read my review) and had dined here instead.  Regrets...",4 star rating,Richard C.

5/26/2017,"Berkeley, CA","As travel professionals, we are extremely careful in choosing the food venues we select. Be it for meals while on tour with a group or as a venue to recommend to our independent travelers. This is why it pains us to write a slightly negative review of Succulent Cafe. First, we had an absolutely lovely time at dinner there with guests from Switzerland one evening. The atmosphere, the attentive service, the fantastic food ... a well-deserved reputation for a 5 star review. BUT, the next day we had the Cafe cater the food for an event we held for a group of Swiss guests at a local winery. It is, even now after numerous exchanges of emails with the responsible person at the Cafe, hard to understand the discrepancy between what we were expecting (and paid for) and the actual product delivered. Some of the food items we ordered were missing. The sandwiches were OK. The central piece of the event we had planned, the equivalent of five of the Cafe's signature 4+4 charcuterie and cheese  platters (and calculated by the Cafe to satisfy about 20 people) ended up being a single measly plastic platter with hardly enough food on it for maybe 8 to 10 people (but we still were charged $ 220 for it). A single bag of chips and a couple of plastic-wrapped string-cheese fingers (the type all parents know from their kids' lunchbox) made a bizarre appearance. We felt thoroughly cheated and, even worse, embarrassed in front out our guests. Such a disappointment.  So 5 stars for dinner and no stars at all for catering. Not sure how to rate the whole experience. 1 star ?",1 star rating,Tapooz T.

If you are in Solvang, walk or run to Succulent and make a dinner reservation! Let me preface this by saying that we just finished 3 super days in Napa Valley where we dined twice on the street in Yountville with more Michelin stars per capita than anywhere else in the US, including Bouchon...and only Succulent has inspired a 5-star review. I never caught the waiter's name, but he was amazing. Friendly, welcoming, eager to share the local wines and foods with us, he recommended the perfect wine for our flatiron steak and duck cassoulet. There were biscuits with a grenache jelly that melted in our mouths, and we also had the divers scallops with yuzu vinaigrette, which he was happy to share more information about where to buy and how to cook with since I had never had yuzu. Now we finish only half our meals and are very full. I only realized after the waiter brought out my husband's boxed leftovers that I had none, because the waiter had thought I was finished and I neglected to ask for mine to be boxed up.The thought of missing out on the rest of the duck confit cassoulet disappointed me and my face and reaction must have showed the disappointment because lo and behold after we had paid and were leaving, the waiter came after us with some of the Grenache jelly packaged to take home as an offering to make up for this. (They sell a lot of their jams and conserves right there, but not this one.) Now that is service! Go to Succulent when you are in Solvang!

8/18/2013,"Davis, CA","Wow, worst dinning experience ever! If I was the manager/ owner (who was MIA the entire evening), I would fire the entire front of the house. After being seated, it took 15 minutes for our server to even greet us. After placing our entree and appetizer order (bacon wrapped scallops), the food runner/ bus boy brought out the wrong dish and tried to pawn it off as the scallops. I've worked in fine dinning for over 10 years, you can't bull shit me kid. The food was ok and I can deal with the paper napkins, trashy uniforms, uncomfortable chairs and silverware sloppily placed in a mason jar on the table, but nothing could prepare me for the horror I was about to bestow: employees walking around the dining room chewing food. An employee even brought out food to a table with cheeks full of food, chewing away as if to say ""yea I just took this off your plate"", absolutely unacceptable! Entrees took over an hour, I asked twice what was the problem and got the response ""It's in the works"".  No reason for the delay, there were only a few other tables. Maybe if they didn't spend so much time in the back and an actual manager was on duty, service would suck harder than a Dyson vacuum. Please don't support this shit hole, there are so many other great restaurants in SY valley who deserve your business.",1 star rating,michael S.
8/6/2014,"Long Beach, CA","This place is really awesome!  Very casual and homey feeling.  They give you the cutest little biscuits and jam instead of the usual bread basket.  The food we had was pretty good. I had the fried chicken and it was ok, a little dry but the mac and cheese it came with was awesome.  My husband had the three little pigs which had good flavors but I didn't like the texture of the bacon, it was mushy.  We shared a flatbread too and it was really good.  The service was a little slow but extremely nice and friendly. Very helpful and knowledgeable. I'd definitely go back and try a different dish. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and concept overall.",4 star rating,L T.
3/14/2014,"Pismo Beach, CA",Epic meal.Three little pigs (bacon wrapped pork) sea bass with pancetta & fried chicken with savory Mac & Chhese. Perfection in every bite.

8/18/2013,"Roanoke, TX","We read the glowing reviews in the car as we drove from Monterey to Buelton...We made reservations for Sunday, August 18@ 6:30.The restaurant atmosphere is most pleasant .We were greeted by the hostess who sat us . The restaurant was not busy. My husband ordered the soup,I ordered the artichoke confit dip. He did enjoy his soup. Mini biscuits were brought to the table; artistically presented. I ordered  the pork roast,my husband assumed,wrongly, that ordering the Fried chicken was a safe choice. To the contrary...the entrees took far too long to prepare,and sadly, when he cut into his chicken,it was raw. Pink,cold,far from a crispy crust and raw. I read   so many glowing reviews about the breakfast and lunch,obviously, the dinner menu most assuredly requires extreme improvement .Anything BUT Succulent...",1 star rating,Mp H.

The feel of the restaurant is nice, sort of country/rustic. Had the shrimp appetizer which was tasty but messy! My bf got the butternut squash soup which was delish. We both shared one of their pizzas. It was good, thin crust. The prices are a bit more than some places but it was an overall tasty meal. Next time I would like to try their famous charcuterie platters. Service was a bit slow but it seemed like they had enough staff to customer ratio. But overall not a bad experience.",4 star rating,Kimberly J.

8/18/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Reservation at 730. Still here at 830 with no food. Service is slow, inattentive, and uneducated about their menu. Food runner gave us a salad with toast on it saying it was our scallops.. Really? Often times there are no servers on the floor, no manager on site and it seems as though everyone is brand new and has no restaurant experience. Spoke with hostess in regards to our entrees and she did not even ask. There is another couple next to us and they haven't even been helped its had been about 20 min for them. Update: busboy delivered food to another table chomping away at food of us own. Classy. Hopefully food makes up for this. Definitely not coming back.",1 star rating,Jillian S.

Mom and I started with the steak tartar which was wonderful. For entrees my dad enjoyed every bite of the short ribs and mom and I split the pork belly porchette which was super tender, delicious and the beans were fabulous. They pack in so much flavor in their meals!  A wonderful surprise was an absolutely delicious berry shortcake brought out to my dad for his birthday. Also, an excellent local wine list. The atmosphere is definitely cafe style with bistro style wooden chairs and tables and silverware in jars on the tables.

Ordered the $15.00 Eggs Benedict and was thrown off guard when asked if I wanted to add Ham. I chose no ham. Inside seating is bare tables with no necessities. Inside does not have that warm welcoming feeling. Music was country played way above comfort level. On a good note Food was excellent, a clear 5 star even without the Ham.

The staff at Succulent was able to fit us in without one, but it was pretty busy and the couple before us had to take a seat at the bar so I would suggest that you make a reservation if possible. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. The food took a while to come out, but it was well worth it. The little biscuits that they serve you beforehand are to-die-for!",5 star rating,Cindy S.

4/9/2012,"St. George, UT","Discovering places like this is why I love Yelp....Checked the Yelp app while in Solvang and decided on lunch at Succulent. My wife had the meatloaf sandwich while I opted for the Salmon Sandwich.Both were outstanding. My sandwich came with a large moist piece of salmon. I hesitated before ordering because salmon is so easy to dry out when cooking; this was the best piece of salmon I've had in some time.... My wife's meatloaf sandwich was a large piece of meatloaf over a hunk of delicious cornbread. The cole slaw was also terrific.

I am still dreaming about them. Lunch was fabulous, especially if you actually have taste buds and want to avoid the kitschy Solving tourist traps. On a weekend, though, it is very busy so patience is a must. Dinner was delicious but the priciest of course.

It came out with two different types of cheeses and two meats along with some fruits, nuts, pickled veggies, homemade jam and mustard seed. We also got the three little pigs which is pork tenderloin with creamed spinach, and fried mashed potatoes on the bottom. Food was great and service was even more amazing! Shoutout to Errol, one of the greatest servers I've ever had! He was so attentive, funny and just a joy to talk to.

This is the BEST restaurant I've ever been to and I haven't even been able to get past their breakfast food, so I can only imagine how heavenly the rest of their food is! I'm not just being ridiculous here. It really IS the BEST breakfast food I've EVER had and I live in Los Angeles which isn't exactly lacking in great places to eat!! I always get the same thing. The best charcuterie bacon on earth with breakfast potatoes, toast and poached eggs smothered with inexplicably great country style gravy. I really have to venture past the breakfast food to see how great the rest of their food is. I live in L.A. and specifically plan my wine country trips around their breakfast hours.

9/22/2016,"Buellton, CA","Had breakfast with my husband early on a Saturday. I give three stars for the food. I would love to give five stars but the customer service is very poor. You wait in line to order and then you get a number and they deliver your food to your table. I wanted an over-medium egg with my order, I was told that they only serve scrambled or poached eggs. What? This is odd. Though the food was very good, the service was cold and indifferent. The lack of ambience stood out during our visit. It would be so easy to improve the dining experience for customers. There is a self-serve coffee and water station at the entrance of the restaurant; however if you sit at the inside dining room you have to take a stroll back to the front to get refills. Wouldn't it be nice for the employees to walk around and take the initiative to refill water glasses and coffee cups. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a coffee and water station available inside the main dining room. We spilled a glass of water, no staff around but eventually I was able to get the attention of a busboy. Most of the ice and water spilled on the ground not on our table but I wanted to let staff know in order to avoid an accident or a fall. The young man cleaned up and walked away. No connection or response even after we apologized and thanked him for cleaning the mess. The staff is not happy. Is that a reflection of the management, I wonder? One out of the five employees we encountered were interested and friendly. The rest didn't want to be there. It makes for a cold dining environment.",3 star rating,BadGoat S.

Apparently, my love for their meatloaf isn't sufficient for the wife (she is likely jealous, and rightfully so).  Their meatloaf is absolutely ridiculous.  Best meatloaf I have ever had the pleasure of devouring.  The portion is generous, and the pricing is fair.  Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because of their location...

4/29/2015,"Utrecht, The Netherlands","I admit, I've only tried the burger and iced tea - but what a great burger! Bun was perfect, just soft enough outside, well toasted inside. Shaved onions were actually done right. Tomato slices were freshly cut, from a good tomato. I'd sub a different lettuce for the soft Bibb-type they use, but that's just my own taste.The burger meat itself was everything Berkeley's ""Burgermeister"" was not. I ordered medium well, and it was perfect - still juicy and full of flavor, all the way through.And the fries? Home made to the max. Crispy crisp on the outside, delicious and buttery on the inside. Couldn't ask for better. For my personal taste, the pickle was a bit odd - perhaps home made? Sweet and sour, when I expected a regular deli-style pickle. And I'd get a different iced tea, one with less dark musk to the flavor. But those are personal taste issues.I wish I'd had a longer stay; the salads on the other tables looked fabulous, as did the fried chicken. Wish I'd known about the homemade lemonade, too!Highly recommend, based on the other reviews as well as my personal experience.",5 star rating,Krash T.

8/19/2013,"Roanoke, TX","We had reservations for dinner based upon very positive reviews on-line. We were disappointed immediately upon entry. The hostess was unqualified for her job, only to find out so was our waitress. The food was under cooked and I was unable to even begin to eat the chicken. The waitress after trying to assist us with the local wines explained that she was a beer drinker and did have a lot to learn about wine. are you kidding me. They did remove the chicken which was raw from our bill but we left feeling we had a terrible experience. There was one waitress who tried hard to make our experience right but it was frankly too late. She was very good, ours was unemployable at other than a beer bar which was her obvious expertise. From reviews they seem to have Breakfast and Lunch down, pass on dinner, it will not be a pleasant experience. Others around us were also disappointed.",1 star rating,John H.
5/22/2016,"Lompoc, CA",Don't know if it was a bad night but my wife and I were there last night and probably won't be back.  I ordered the crispy Brussels Sprouts and they were quite tasty.  If I had them as an entree I would have been pleased.  I ordered the grilled duck breast with purple cauliflower and forbidden rice.  It was the most underwhelming meal I have had in this town with great restaurants.  First the orange gastrique was poured over everything except the cauliflower so all I could taste was this intense orange flavor.  The duck breast appeared to have been pre cooked and then reheated on the grill since it was well done and cool in the center. The cauliflower had no seasoning whatsoever.  My wife was also less than impressed with her filet.  They serve it with a pat of herbed butter but the steak was cool enough that the butter wasn't melting.  So since the herbed butter didn't melt the steak had no seasoning on it.  It was also quite tough for a filet.  All in all if you want to spend $100 dollars on dinner without alcohol there are a ton of better places to eat in Solvang.,2 star rating,Erik H.
3/9/2014,"San Diego, CA","We ate at the Cafe for lunch and breakfast. Both were really good. Solvang is full of old, out of date establishments that serve really mediocre food and this was a real blessing. Breakfast was a particular stand out. We had the short rib hash and poached eggs with sausage. Everything was solid. The eggs were perfectly clocked with hard whites and runny yolks and the has was tastiest and most melt in the mouth hash I've had for a long time. In addition to the great food they had a notable playlist of great music both time (if you like Foster the People, Capital Cities, Broken Bells etc) that was the perfect volume for enjoying it but also being able to have a conversation. The service was also really genuine and friendly which we didn't find in other Solvang restaurants.",4 star rating,John-Paul F.

I have had the fried chicken salad twice, good once when they weren't busy. The problem with most restaurants here is that they cater to tourists who won't be back for a while.

4/27/2013,"Austin, TX","Don't follow the crowd to Paula's Pancake (they're fine, but not as great as the long lines for brunch suggest). Instead, take a few steps east to Succulent Cafe, the best restaurant in the Santa Ynez Valley IMHO. Yes, if you're in Solvang you're supposed to have traditional Danish food and eat the pastries, so fine, go ahead and do that once for the experience. Then come here.Went for dinner with 3 friends and it was so good we came back for breakfast the next day and were blown away again. It is not Danish-themed like almost everything else in Solvang, so it's a welcome break from the surrounding fare. For dinner, we were there after the big annual Vintner's Festival, so it was as busy as it gets - full house. Still, service was quick, and the staff were vibrant and happy. There's a casual homey vibe here, but the food is inventive, hearty, and high-end - and you wont' be disappointed in the portions!  Presentation is excellent too - we were taking pictures of our grub before digging in. Great wines are served (of course). It was just such a satisfying experience in every aspect. For breakfast, definitely do one of their smothered biscuit breakfast ""sandwiches"" as they are to die for. (And massive! - I didn't eat again until dinner.)This place is definitely a foodie's oasis in Solvang. And frankly, worth the detour off the 101 if you're passing through. I go up to the Santa Ynez Valley frequently throughout the year for wine tours and events, and now that I've found this place, I'll keep coming back!",5 star rating,Phillip K.

The management was nice about it and offered us some sauce to put on it to make it not dry but we didn't think that covering up our $12 sandwich was the way to go. So, we ordered something else and it was great. So two stars for a restaurant who's logo has a pig on it but their pork is less then desirable. Boo.",2 star rating,T A.

It was very good. But he really liked the rice that came with it. My son had the succulent bacon burger and I had the roasted beet salad. Both were good too. This restaurant even has a menu for dogs which is a nice touch. The service was excellent. I think our server's name was Ty.

12/22/2013,"Solvang, CA","We have been eyeing this place for many months as we walked by but never went in. What a shame that we did not venture in sooner, it was one of the best meals we have had out in a long time. We went with another couple so we started with a meat and cheese plate, at first I thought it was a little over priced, but when it came it was full of goodies and the meat was amazing. For dinner I had a dish called ""three little pigs"" and it was anything but little. The pork was not over cooked and had wonderful flavor. I would get it again except there is so many other items on the menu that I want to try. The wait staff was well informed about what was on the menus and was able to answer any questions we had. This is a big plus in my book because it shows that the server is serious about there job and not there to just get through the night.  Over all a great place and a great deal for downtown Solvang with all the ""mains"" under $30, beers and wine was well priced also.

7/24/2012,"Dana Point, CA","Gem among the Tourist Traps: A Tale of Two MealsThe line for Paula's Pancake House on Sunday morning was so long that disconsolate-looking groups of tourists clustered on sidewalk benches. My husband and I caught each other's glances. ""Suckers,"" we muttered in unison, and started laughing. Just two doors away was the object of our hunt: gourmet breakfast biscuits at Succulent Café, where we had had one of the most delicious dinners in recent memory just the night before. We felt like we had gotten in on a great secret and couldn't wait to try out another meal.Succulent Café is a family business: husband is the chef, wife runs front of house and her brother Robert is maitre d' extraordinaire. I'm partial to any restaurant with a pig logo, but this place cures its own meat, and it is incredible. Tiny, unpretentious, comfortable, the restaurant provides fine dining without heartburn prices---if you consider fresh, local ingredients and wines fine; I do. The staff is wonderful, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about their food. Ask for their food and wine recommendations and trust them---they are spot on. When we arrived in Solvang Saturday night, friends who have never eaten at the same restaurant twice in a row basically steered us straight to the Succulent Café. ""You have to try this restaurant we found last night,"" they said. ""It's the real deal."" They were right. The staff welcomed us charmingly. Seated to the sounds of next door's live jazz, we started sipping cool drinks while squinting in the late summer sunlight.Tiny tender, buttery biscuits arrived first with preserves. They were incredible with the potted almond-leek-goat cheese dip ($7.50), which came with its own savory crisps. Bacon-wrapped divers scallops ($16) exploded in the mouth: crispy, juicy, savory and satisfying topped with spicy sambal aioli, balanced by a few delicate salad greens with fresh yuzu vinaigrette. We were full of good things by the end of the appetizers, but as soon as the main dishes arrived, we got hungry all over again. My calabacitas stuffed poblano pepper ($19) came with purple potatoasparagus hash, coconut curry, and chili oil and was so hearty and flavorful that I didn't realize it was meatless till almost finished. I respect a restaurant that can make  something truly delicious without meat that is satisfying and complete. The rest of our table had molasses braised shortrib ($24) on creamy parmesan grits, haricots verts, with red dragon sauce and house apple chutney. The tender meat practically melted on contact and filled the mouth with richness, warmth, and sweetness. Grits completed the ultimate comfort plate; I found the apple chutney superfluous. Braised Brussels sprouts were incredibly tender and sweet; I had never met such a tasty sprout before. ""Growing up, our mom made the most disgusting Brussels sprouts,"" Robert confided. ""We decided to make our own version. Believe me, the sprout has been redeemed!Plumpness be darned, we couldn't let dessert pass us by after that showing. On staff recommendations, we ordered the triple chocolate spoon bread ($8) and bacon-caramel sundae ($8). I am generally a sharing type of person, but one bite of the bacon-caramel sundae and I started resenting my tablemates their bites. Crisp, salty, nearly-burned bacon with chunks of buttery nut cookie bar and decadent caramel sauce over caramel pecan ice cream---it actually tastes better than it sounds, truly more than a sum of its parts. The combination is magical and addictive. After that, the chocolately spoon bread (like a tender, richer brownie) with bourbon crème anglais and chocolate ice cream was just a consolation prize. At any other time I'd be raving about that too.Despite still feeling full from the night before, breakfast did not disappoint. We filled our table with the braised short rib biscuit, PBT (house cured pancetta, basil, tomato) biscuit, meatloaf biscuit, and fried chicken and gravy biscuit, not to mention extra side orders of home-cured bacon (there is no such thing as ""enough"" of Succulent's bacon) and remarkably tasty breakfast potatoes, juices and coffee. We inhaled it all, each lost in the artfully balanced textures and flavors playing symphonies in our mouths. Afterward, we looked at each other and nodded. Yes, we were coming back to the Succulent Café---and going to eat here all weekend next time. I crave it already.",5 star rating,Margaret P.
2/15/2016,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I had dinner here last saturday night. There were things that were great and things that were not so great.  I like the ambience and thought the service for dinner was friendly and efficient (we were there early).  We had bacon wrapped scallops and a beet salad for starters and they were both very good.  The sides that came wth the entrees were very good.  The problem was with the entrees themselves.  I got the 'pan seared' halibut which was not pan-seared at all.  The fish was fresh, or at least did not taste fishy, but the method of preparation was bizarre.  It was lightly breaded, which sounds great, but the fish actually had a gelatinous consistency not unlike Lutefisk.  If you've never tried Lutefisk, consider yourself lucky.  Anyway, the strange preparation was supposed to have a sage beurre blanc sauce, but I so no evidence of it on the plate.  My boyfiend had the meatloaf, which was pretty mediocre.  Two beers, 2 entrees and the 2 starters was $116 (not including tip), and I thought that was a lot of money considering we didn't love our entrees.  I will give it another shot though, but will order different entrees next time.",3 star rating,Kim W.
12/23/2012,"Orange, CA","We had the pork belly sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich. Both were good, but the pork belly was by far superior. The only thing keeping us from giving this place one more star is the fact that the sandwiches cost $11 or $12 each, and they're served alone (we're not counting the thimble-sized pickled veggies). I suggest they consider throwing a few potato chips on the plate, or perhaps a few pieces of mixed greens and call it a small side salad. That amount of money calls for a bit more.",3 star rating,Jimberly W.

So by the time we got in town we just wanted to eat. As luck would have it there was a parking spot right across the street from the restaurant, which we grabbed. Our party of six starving adults agreed to eat at the first place we saw. We ordered lunch at the counter, got a seat outside and chatted until the food arrived. I ordered a chicken quesadilla but they served me a steak quesadilla. That's one reason it's not a 5-star review. But... It was THE BEST quesadilla I have ever eaten. LA, Frisco, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Carmel, Mammoth Lakes...I've eaten quesadillas in every nook & crannie in California, and this one was hands down the best. It dripped with deliciousness.

5/12/2014,"Thousand Oaks, CA","Very disappointed...we were attracted by the name and concept and walked in.  This place is split in 2 separate sections. One entry says coffee bar and the other entrance says wine bar. We entered through the wine bar but there was no one around to sit us or guide us. We saw customers eating at their tables and at the busy bar serviced by a bartender.  We found a table and sat...and sat...   We finally stopped a food runner and found out that you need to enter through the coffee bar and place and pre-pay for your order. By then there was a huge line (about 30 minutes) just to get to the front.  The menu looked enticing and the wine selection seemed nice. We were very disappointment with the food. The food  tasted just like any other common bar food/fast food.   Spicy crispy chicken and buttermilk chicken were probably fried on premise but not freshly prepared in the restaurant, probably from a  mediocre frozen packet. Salad tasted straight out of the pre-packaged green mix bag.  We had planned on going  back later for wine and cheese but our lunch was so bad that we decided to go elsewhere.   If you want a ""fast food chain like"" meal presented in a nicer basket  this is the place.  But it will cost you a lot more than a fast food chain.The breakfast looked good but due to the lack of guidance or signs on where to order and the long line afterwards we missed the breakfast menu.",2 star rating,Ro B.

5/16/2013,"Costa Mesa, CA",Succulent Cafe is a good solid restaurant tucked in Solvang..in which if you haven't been...make a trip ! Nicely prepared food and somewhat attentive wait staffing however I understand it looked like one server had the whole restaurant. Just a couple points made (from what I saw others were having a 5 star experience) but just my luck that the 'jar of silverware' had uniquely antiqued silverware...i get it it's supposed to be charming and cute but there were not enough forks and getting a waiter to grab one was near impossible...so I ended up eating my meal with a small teaspoon (and a crusty oxidized nappy one  at that)...plus I was 'blessed' with the coveted 'restroom' table !! In where you will delightfully get to meet every guest plus drunken LA yuppie in the restaurant that evening and sometimes twice...a one star deduction for that experience ! Just do away with that table...it will be the bane of an otherwise lovely evening....,3 star rating,Mark D.

1/5/2016,"Arroyo Grande, CA","I went here to celebrate with my husband and planned on spending $100 on amazing food.  Unfortunately we were disappointed and spent less then $50 after tax and tip.  Our appetizer was amazing, the 2 + 2, unfortunately it all ended there.  We got the tomato basil soup for our second course.  We had to send them back, the chef added cannellini beans, then purred it.  It was too thick, horrible.  Then we ordered one lamb burger med rare.  It was not over cooked, but the meat was dry and tasteless.  The cumin yogurt sauce was good on it, but our bun was over heated on the bottom and crunchy.  The fries that came with it were really good though.  The biscuits that were left for us on our table were hard and inedible.  We tried a few of them, we were shocked they were so bad.  The yeast did smelled good in them.  Our server was ok.  She needed to check on us a bit more, but the food arrived timely.  She had no idea what meat or cheese would be on the charcuterie platter and we ran out of water a few times.  The hostess sat us right in front of the exit door, not a good location at all.I would only go back to get the charcuterie platter, that was awesome.  I loved the variety on it, but that would be all, maybe more fries.",1 star rating,Stacy B.

2/16/2015,"Lompoc, CA","I ordered the spicy fried chicken sandwich with the pasta salad side (95 cents for the side). The pasta salad was good.....not great. The pasta was cooked perfectly, not over done under done. The salad tasted strongly of bell pepper, which is a main ingredient. I believe 2 different kinds of fresh bell pepper was used. If you love the taste of bell pepper, this pasta salad is for you. The spicy fried chicken sandwich was good......not great. The chicken breast that was used was cooked very well.....not dry and was breaded. I like me my fried chicken sandwiches to taste like fried chicken and this one didn't but was good none the less. The blue cheese that is on the sandwich was very good but it over powered the whole sandwich, a common problem when using this wonderful cheese. The wine sold here is local....which is good. The Pinot that the bartender recommend was very good to say the least. It should be noted here that for last lunch and breakfast, you order at the front counter, you then take a small Terra cotta plate, with you with a number on it and they deliver your meal to your table. 6 tap beers are also available at the bar area. Overall a nice experience. The bartender did mention to me that they have recently hired a new head chef. He also mentioned that they may start brunch here with breakfast served all day....we'll see. I will definitely come again and try the dinner menu.",3 star rating,Jerry W.
8/28/2012,"San Fernando, CA","Came here when the rest of the party went wine tasting and I had the better time. You order at the counter and take your drink and number to your table. You have the choice of inside seating, a bar at the window, or outside under umbrellas. I had the house cured pastramie and that weeks potatoe salad. The sandwich was awesome. thick cut pastramie with cheese and homemade mustard (quite strong so ask for easy if horseradish isn't your thing) and the potatoe salad has me rethinking my own, with small yellow potatoes, blue cheese chunks, fennel  and capers. I also had the lemonade which tasted homemade. for sweet I had panna cotta with homemade strawberry rhubarb jam - a great ending. The meal wasn't cheap , but the food reflected the care and attention the cooks put forth and was definitely worth it.I came back 2 weeks later on the tail end of a roadtip and had the hero sandwich filled with a selection of their house cured meats. My travel buddy had the ham sandwich which she said was tasty.",5 star rating,Susan M.

Sitting along side was a perfecly poached egg. Served with a small portion of gravy as well. All was great and I nearly was able to finish.  If the other items on the menu are as good, we in the Valley are in for a great treat.  I and my wife will be back, they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner with beer and wine.  You will have to see the menu items, very, very interesting.  Thank you for opening in Solvang I will see you soon for lunch or dinner.",5 star rating,Alan H.

The short rib just blew our minds! I can't recommend this place enough! Make a reservation too!",5 star rating,ryan d.
1/22/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","The best way to describe this restaurant is with one word -- memorable.  The food was consistently excellent.  The prices are fair.  The service is top notch.  My group went for dinner and combined to order at least half the menu.  I ordered, or had tastes of, the charcuterie plate, bacon-wrapped diver scallops, lamb chops (huge plate of 6-7), brussel sprouts (again with bacon), a steak dish,  some potatoes with crab I believe as a side dish, and probably more.  All were excellent with the duck prosciutto, brussel sprouts, and diver scallops real highlights.  I didn't hear anyone complain about a single choice.  It was so good we returned for lunch and had a totally different experience.  Instead of fine-dining style, it was order-at-the-counter sandwiches and salads.  I had the short rib and tasted the charcuterie hero with prickly pear lemonade.  Again, fantastic.  Highly recommend.  I'd have eaten a third meal there in the single weekend had they been open Monday.",5 star rating,Ken F.
3/16/2013,"Pasadena, CA","The food here is GREAT.  My wife ordered the yellowtail sandwich which is one of the best tasting sandwich I ordered.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is primarily because it cost us about $30 to have lunch here.  We ordered two main entrees and two drinks.  So for a casual lunch it was a little pricey.  But if you are looking for great tasting food in Solvang and are ok to drop a few more bucks, this is a must.",4 star rating,Luke K.

6/10/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","I was so excited to try this place.  My fiance and I are getting married in Santa Ynez and wanted to try out the restaurant for possible catering.  Where to start... first of all the food was covered in sauce, the idea of farm to table is fresh and letting the ingredients speak for themselves.  I asked for no bacon on the brussel sprouts but the kictchen messed up and put them on, I asked for new brussel sprouts and they came back practically raw covered with cheese (not asked for) and drowning in balsamic vinegar.  I couldn't even eat one sprout.  Our waitress forgot our appetizer and gave us so much eye rolling and entree slamming onto the table you would think that it was our fault the kitchen messed up.  The other waitresses seemed nice but this one made me feel like I was imposing by just asking her questions or ordering wine.   I'm so surprised by everyone's review, maybe we're spoiled in Los Angeles with kind service coupled with real farm to table style food.  Suffice to say we're not doing catering with Succulent and PS we had to go to a nearby grocery store afterwards to pick up some food because after $100 dollar dinner we had eaten hardly any of it.",1 star rating,Linda P.

Price is average to the rest of Solvang but compared to the quality and the quantity of what you get, I think it's more than worth it.

4/21/2014,"Irvine, CA","Well it's difficult to give a good review when you ended up sick from the dinner, but I'll try to set that aside at first. We were disappointed with our meals; all were unremarkable. My mom had the meatloaf, which she said was ""pretty good."" We had pesto pasta that was just okay, a hamburger that had very little flavor, a beet salad that was drowning in beet juice and whatever oily dressing they used. And I ordered a red blend from their much-lauded wine list, and it was also just okay. Oh, and the scallops, which I'm sure now were bad because I was ill the rest of the evening. So, no, not happy with Succulent Café. We had a much better dinner at an Italian place in town the night before.",2 star rating,Mary W.

4/7/2013,"San Francisco, CA","So glad we had a reservation. It just doesn't get better than this. So fresh. So delicious. We ordered the steak, lamb, short ribs and meatloaf. All delicious. But the biggest WOW was the 2+2 charcuterie. 2 cheeses, 2 house-made meats (sopressato and pancetta for us) and 14 (I think-if i remembered them all) little super-yummy acctrements like honeycomb, dates, beets, nuts and olives). Not to be missed. I've long felt everyone should see Solvang once but once was enough. Now that Succulent Cafe is in town we'll be back every chance we get. It's true dinner seating can be tricky-many parties were turned away while we were there because there just aren't many tables. BUT-they are expanding into the lovely adjacent space soon that looks like it will triple, at least, the dinner capacity. Try breakfast or lunch if you can't get in for dinner. Walk up service and same yummy preparations.",5 star rating,Laura S.
3/21/2015,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA","I was with my girlfriend we both ordered sandwiches. We decided to sit down at the counter right in front of the kitchen/cashier. We waited for about 30 minutes until we decided to ask about the status of our meal. They said they couldn't find us and that our meal would be out soon. So we waited a few more minutes and saw a confused looking waiter wandering outside with what appeared to be our food. We waved him down and it was indeed our food. He acknowledged the excessive wait by giving a free pastry (pecan bar). The sandwiches were quite good but the long wait due to their inability to find us (even though we sat just feet away from the main counter and kitchen with our table number in clear view) was very frustrating and definitely detracted from the experience, hence the 3 stars.",3 star rating,Brandon B.
6/1/2014,"Torrance, CA","Solvang, Danish waffles, Danish pastries, Danish everything.  Since I  have been going to Solvang that was the only cuisine I thought imaginable.  So suggesting Succulent was a bit of a gamble that I was going to click my clogs and not have danish food.  My clogs worked!  I got ""HCF"" Haute Comfort Food and what a great surprise and delight.  I thought Oh-0h walking from the backside it was very unassuming but when we walked in it felt like a gastropub in Portland or Seattle.  The food and service was outstanding, the charcuterie was a feast for the eyes and palette, not your standard.... fruits, nuts, cheeses, meats IT WAS fruits, nuts, cheeses, meats a must to get.  And the homemade Caesar Salad dressing, a dressing that can dress up  a charred romaine to perfection.  The entrees I will not go into specifics because they were all good but what stood out the most was the artisan treatment on how each dish was prepared, the peas were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was fried to perfection and the biscuits were light and heavenly.  But the top of the night was the Bacon on several dishes was the pinnacle of the evening.  I really did feel like the dog in the commercial that keeps on repeating ""bacon, bacon, bacon"".  A must try ... clogs not required.",5 star rating,Toby N.

However, the sandwich my girlfriend had was really good. I think it was a halibut sandwich with hummus. Don't quote me on that though.We also ordered their prickly passion fruit lemonade and it was far too strong and bitter. We diluted it about 50% with water and then it was drinkable.

We absolutely loved the food, the homemade jams, the fresh little biscuits that were served just because, the friendly owner, and the fantastic tuna sandwich. We planned our lunch stop while traveling today to eat at Succulent, and had been really looking forward to it. Initially we were excited to see the expansion, which apparently happened a long time ago now, since it has been 3 years since our last visit. We heard ownership had changed, and the menu seems quite different. My tuna melt was fine- just nothing special. My husband said his eggs benedict had a soggy english muffin, was cold, and a couple pieces of potato were undercooked. We waited a really long time, and were sad to see the quality in food decline. One of the things that made it special before was how well thought out each detail was, and how well they were executed. It stood out among all of the other restaurants in Solvang, having many unique offerings. We miss the pickled veggies on the side. I will say the servers were really polite, and of course the restaurant and patio are beautifully maintained.",3 star rating,Becky R.

We were thinking of solvang restaurant for a Danish breakfast but we were pointed toward Succulent Cafe instead with promises that anything we ordered would be delicious.We walked over and noticed two different doors, one ahead to what looked like a deli counter and another to the right to what looked like a restaurant and bar. Both doors had an Open sign and the door to the right looked like what we wanted. Turns out it wasn't. Luckily there was someone there to point us to the door other door where we order before sitting. I think they should really make it clear with signage where to go.That is where the downsides end.I ended up with the succulent eggs Benedict and based on the cashier's recommendation I got it with bacon.  It was fantastic!  The biscuit it was on was more of a southern style biscuit topped with tomato, a ton of spinach, a perfectly done poached egg and a lemony hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend, although I can't remember the name if the dish, got a biscuit with a side of bacon and sausage.  Biscuit was awesome.  It was clear they knew what they were doing with the meat, because  it was all beautifully seasoned and prepared.  I would hope a place with ""charcuterie"" in the name would do meats right, and they certainly did.I should note that utensils, napkins, and condiments are not on the tables, but are very visible and available for guests to get themselves, as well as self poured water. I feel like if they would just make it clear where guests should go, as it wasn't just my boyfriend and I who initially walked in the wrong door: two or three other groups made that mistake during our meal, there would be absolutely no downsides.Next the we find ourselves in Solvang we will be returning for lunch or dinner!",5 star rating,Sara W.

6/22/2012,"Santa Monica, CA","We came for lunch and were impressed with how much it reminded us of lunch in coastal Los Angeles: Hits were the Chef's salad was loaded with a great mix of assorted charcuterie and cheese (If you're British, it is a Ploughman's Plate in a salad), the fried chicken sandwich. Very good was the fried chicken salad--I think it would have been a hit if the dressing was the blue cheese used in the sandwich rather than the ranch I was given. The fried chicken pieces were of good size, not greasy at all. Average was the pastrami sandwich. Outside and indoor tables are generally set for 4 but can be put together for larger parties.Note: the salads are large and can serve 2. Lunch is offered most days of the week. They only serve dinner the latter part of the week. I think the antique and visually aged silverware looks icky and I would prefer standard issue stainless.",4 star rating,A A.

My wife considered her food average at best. My ""1"" rating and my wife's ""2.5"" is the rationale behind my  giving them an overall rating of 2.

2/13/2013,"San Mateo, CA","Thanks Yelp for this great recommendation!  We had the BEST fresh fish sandwiches ever - lemon pepper snapper with mixed greens, tomato, and lemon tartar (may have a few other things - I don't remember) but it was THE BOMB.  Came here with mom and at first she was skeptical but didn't really want to say anything - sandwiches really aren't her thing, but this place had gotten great reviews and I wanted to really try this.  She had foiled one of my other plans and I wasn't going to let her foil this one.  Anyway, one bite into the sandwich and she was in heaven.  She was so busy concentrating on eating that she didn't really want to talk.  All the ingredients were fresh and the fish didn't have a fishy smell at all.  Also got the honey roasted root vegetable side which was scrumptious.  This was hands down the highlight of our trip to Solvang and I will stop by the next time I am in town.  Our sandwiches were $11 each, which is fair for around here.  Solvang is a tourist town and all the prices reflect that.  It wasn't busy when we went but I suspect this place gets hopping during prime tourist season.",5 star rating,Bebe W.

Bacon cheeseburger with fries. The fries were the best on the plate. Tuna melt was good and had some interesting things inside. Chicken salad was tasty and a nice goat cheese salad with some interesting ginger flavors. Ordered one of the fig pilsners beer which was a little to ""hoppy"" for my taste. But the cheeseboard got thumbs up from everyone at the table. The presentation was really done well and the meats and cheeses on the board were fresh and flavorful. There was this raspberry jam on the board that went with everything. We enjoyed the meal and the place was clean. All the staff had a good attitude and checked with us a couple of times to see if we needed anything else. I would go back there if I am in Solvang again.",4 star rating,Leilani F.

3/12/2016,"New York, NY","I have never written a review before and I find myself writing two. My wife and I are on vacation from New York were staying at The Lansby for a night to meet friends that live in the area. We asked the front desk receptionist to recommend a good, casual place for dinner that would offer a nice place to visit with our friends. It was suggested that we go to Succulent Cafe, across the street. It seemed convenient and our friends said they had dined there last fall and enjoyed it. As we are on a time change, we went early and were seated without a problem. Our waitress seemed distracted, unsure of the specials and said she would be right back. Almost twenty minutes later, she came back (we still had not received water or the little biscuits they serve in lieu of bread). At this point, we just wanted to order so we didn't bother with the specials. We finally got water and biscuits and we waited. And we waited. And we waited. When the food finally arrived, two of the orders were wrong but we decided sending anything back would be a disaster so we just (tried) to eat what we had. Bland, dry, overcooked, and cold are the only words to describe our meal. We decided to cut our loses and leave. Ironically, we went back to The Lansby and had an amazing meal",1 star rating,Chad W.

The manager/owner waited on us and was very charming and polite. He explained everything on the menu and we chose the clams that came with an incredible little panini filled with a delicious cheese that we dipped in to the clam broth. We had them bring more little biscuits so we could dip in the broth so we wouldn't reduced to licking the bowl! (It was that good!) Next we had the pork pancetta and let me say that this transcends pork in any way I've ever had it served. The skin was perfectly seasoned with a nice crisp. The fat was so soft and delicate, it would melt as soon as you put in your mouth! The meat was so tender it hardly required chewing and it was served with spicy white beans, some nice micro greens and a little whole grilled onion that really gave the dish balance and depth.

8/15/2013,"Yorba Linda, CA","My family (hubby and two boys) checked this place out based on the great reviews.  The food was fancy with limited seating indoors.  Not a big deal if the weather is perfect but when it's 95 degrees, you really want to sit indoors even if it means missing out on looking at the nice Danish buildings around you.  Hubby and I ordered the turkey sandwich and the pbc (prosciutto, basil and cheese?).  They were both very tasty.  The sandwiches here are not the normal mustard and mayo-type sandwiches.  Rather they are pretty different with sprouts, spinach, etc. as the innards.  I love these types of sandwiches.  I'm sure they'd put in whatever you wanted but they made it the way they normally would and it really did taste delicious.  We did not realize that there were children's menus until it was too late.  Would've been nice for that to be placed where we could see it but it was buried under the sea of other adult menus so we missed it.  Anyway, so we ordered pizza for the boys.  Simple right?  Every boy and girl in American likes pizza!  Well they do if it isn't made on a flat bread with pomodori sauce and carmelized onions.  We thought that taking out the spinach would make this a winner for them but it wasn't.  It was a little too exotic.  I thought it tasted great but my kids didn't.  Oh well.  Still 5 stars for the adults who loved the food there!",5 star rating,Shirley V.

4/27/2012,"Santa Ynez, CA","So sorry to have to give this review as I am a local in Santa Ynez, and I always wish new restaurants do well.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch today and had a two star experience,  I ordered the special sandwich of the day, which was priced at $11.50 without any side or salad.  The sandwich consisted of  overly toasted run of the mill, white bread, a small amount of cranberry sauce on one side, a handful of arugula and 4 small slices of duck.  The duck was chewy and in fact each piece came out whole with a bite.  You couldn't bite through it. I brought my uneaten half of sandwich in to show the manager, not to get a refund...but to hopefully share a customer's point of view for learning purposes. The manager had a very odd affect as he asked me where the other half of the sandwich was. Right down the street is Fresco.  For the same or less money you can get a delightful sandwich or even an Ahi wrap with avocado and soup or a generous salad of your choice.",2 star rating,Chris S.
10/3/2013,"Buellton, CA",I don't believe you can get a better lunch anywhere in the Santa Ynez valley.  Everything I've tried (and I'm working my way down their lunch menu) is delicious!  It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  If you want a $5 sandwich go to Subway.  These sandwiches are $10 or more but are worth it.  I usually get a potato salad side for only $1 extra and it's always different and always good.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food there!,5 star rating,Jon P.
4/1/2012,"Santa Ynez, CA","WOW.  My husband has raved about the buttermilk fried chicken salad for several weeks now, so we decided to try Succulent Cafe for breakfast.  Let me start by saying that the handful of Danish restaurants in town are excellent for scandinavian themed food and fit the atmosphere.  However, Succulent Cafe may change your dining experience all together.  The artsy, natural authentic atmosphere (with an option to sit outside) blends the country setting of the valley with the convenience of a prime location in town and interesting-fresh-feel-good food.  Order at the counter with a friendly knowledgeable cashier and snag the first seat you can find - you are in for an experience!  We tried the Biscuits with poached egg, cheese, buttermilk fried chicken & bacon topped with the best gravy I ever had.  Coffee was excellent and they have a great selection of local wines and Figueroa brew!  Reasonably priced, very casual, mellow vibe.  Succulent Cafe & Trading company serves lunch and dinner with limited hours so plan ahead.  If you visit Solvang and consider yourself a ""foodie""....you need to try this hidden gem.",5 star rating,Alisse H.

10/6/2013,"Solvang, CA","As usual, our experience at Succulent Cafe was outstanding. I have consistently enjoyed this restaurant so much that I am moved to finally write a review. The food was of top quality, fresh ingredients expertly prepared. What a delight when there is a selection of dishes that are cleverly innovative in their combinations and in the hands of an excellent chef who will do them justice. It shows that the chef has put much thought, creativity, expertise and attention to detail into his creations to delight the patrons; I always look forward to trying a creative dish from an excellent chef that I wouldn't have made at home.After having a difficult time choosing I started with the olives marinated in fennel and orange. I was brought a selection of olives, green and ripe of different types in a short wide canning jar (nice presentation), the marinade was delicious but inconspicuous as should be, the accompaniment was homemade crostini: baguette brushed with olive oil then thinly sliced lengthwise and baked at low heat until perfectly crunchy. The olive oil from the crostini blended nicely with the olive oil from the olives. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed them, having fun picking our favorite varieties but having a hard time at it since they were all delicious. This dish is a steal at $5. I had refrained from choosing their signature cheese and charcuterie (exceptional!, but I always order it) to try something new and was justly rewarded.I just spent the last 20 years living in Italy so am always hesitant to order any pasta stateside since I expect to be disappointed; but the description of the dish added to my previous dining experiences at this restaurant gave me the confidence to choose the pappardelle with blue cheese, asparagus, mushrooms and walnuts. The dish was sublime: the pappardelle were homemade and al dente, the asparagus was thin, market fresh and tender-crisp, the mushrooms flavorful and with the perfect consistency, the bits of walnut added a nice crunch, the fresh parsley added the perfect seasoning, and the blue cheese was the crowning achievement of the dish- just enough to add a bit of zing, making the dish outstanding- not near enough to overwhelm which is a definitive risk when using blue cheese. Also as usual, Robert's (the sommelier) recommendation for wine pairing was spot on, he suggested the Ampelos Pinot Noir which combined expertly with the dish.We concluded the evening with the crème brûlée which did not disappoint: the top crust was nicely brittle and warm, the interior a tad on the sweet side for my taste buds but perfectly creamy and cool. I always enjoy the contrasting magic of a perfectly executed crème brûlée: crunchy/creamy, warm/cool.This was our first visit since their renovations and I must say they've done a beautiful job with the added space, it is brand new and comfortable while maintaining their inviting and somewhat rustic style. I look forward to my next dining experience here, there were so many new dishes on their menu that I want to try. Kudos to the chef.",5 star rating,Talissa G.

7/14/2015,"Anaheim, CA","Don't show up during the breakfast/lunch transition at noon because they only serve breakfast or lunch, not both. Good food but bad experience. Our family of 4 landed here for lunch 5 minutes before noon and were told to wait 5 minutes before ordering lunch so they could finish serving the breakfast crowd. They kept bringing people from the back of the line to the front and when they finally took our lunch order, they didn't process it until every last breakfast order was served! If they had told us this was going to happen we would have happily switched to a breakfast meal but no one communicated with us.  After patiently waiting for a half an hour for our food (that does not include waiting to order time), we finally asked if they had forgotten us and instantly the food was served to a very hungry and now grumpy family. To their credit they did recognize their mistake (only after complaining)and offered beverages for the road. Until they work out how to serve breakfast and lunch at the same time, I don't recommend going here between 11:45 & 12:30 pm.",3 star rating,Rosi 4.

Naturally, the waiting game extended and someone else came back around and asked if I wanted more water, I said ""No, but we're ready to order"" she said ""Your waiter will be right with you"" after about 10 minutes my Fiance and I started to get a little annoyed. There was about 5 maybe more waitresses in sight and NONE of them came to our table. I kept looking around waiting to see which one would come over to help us. The couple next to us were seated after we were and their waitress came around at least twice, I even got to hear the daily specials for the day, which sounded good, but we never got someone to come and say ANY of that to us.

Well when I heard the special was the BBQ meatloaf I was all over it ! What a great experience and food was awsome. We got there early and had to wait for our table so the lady said we could go  next door at Valley Vino and taste some wine while we waited.

2/6/2012,"Dorado, Puerto Rico","My husband and I had a fabulous casual lunch at Succulent Cafe.  First off, I love the menu - lots of great things to choose from ranging from various sandwiches and salads to soups and desserts.   Kudos for having such great local wines on the by-the-glass list - especially one of my favorites, the Kunin Pape Star!  Also, I loved the homemade jellies that are offered for sale - these would make great hostess gifts.  My tuna salad was wonderful!  The super flavorful tuna salad had Kalamata olives in it - YUM - and the greens were very fresh and crisp!  I also had a bowl of their veggie soup of the day which was tomato basil - this was fabulous!  But what really knocked me out was the spicy bloody mary (made with soju, not vodka) garnished with celery, a pickled asparagus spear and house-cured BACON!  It was awesome!  My husband ate the proscuitto sandwich and said it was out of this world.  I am thrilled to find out that they are now offering breakfast too!  We'll definitely be back!",5 star rating,anne b.
12/17/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","I was so happy with my experience here! We started w/bacon wrapped scallops (they make their own bacon here and they aren't afraid to use it generously!). My date had meatloaf. It was ""bready"" not as moist/meaty as some typical meatloafs. Can't say much about it cuz he ate it so fast!! It had squash and gravy and mashed potatoes. I chose the seabass (see photo) loved the burst of flavor from the tomatoes and the potatoes & brussell sprouts among other ingredients were roasted perfectly. Flavorful but not at all overpowering. Clams a nice touch too.Didn't expect to love the dessert so much, but I live seasonal dishes and this certainly was w/persimmons & apple (it's almost winter!) the cinnamon ice cream was the perfect complement and towards the end we really noticed the kick of cayenne that was added while the fruit baked. Great way to end this fantastic meal!Great service and conversation about food and wine. . . we almost had the place to ourselves b/c they just recently opened for dinner -- but it was like going to a private dinner party for 2! Can't wait to go back for breakfast and lunch!",5 star rating,Maggie L.
3/6/2014,"Rosemead, CA","My girlfriend had volunteered to find a lovely and nice restaurant in Solvang while we were passing by on our way to Morro Bay & Hearst Castle. She found this place based on the great reviews. We sat outside on the most and terrific beautiful day. During the afternoon, there was no real waitress...you would basically walk inside and place your order and they would bring it out to you while you wait and your table. I ordered the Short Rib Sandwich and she ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Salad. They were both very tasty. The sandwiches here are not the normal mustard and mayo-type sandwiches. Mine was a rather dry, but I still enjoyed each and every bite. What really threw me over the top was their Buttermilk Fried Chicken Salad. My girlfriend and I shared our plates and it was a great combination. The cashier at the front was amazing. She was friendly and gave us her recommendations about the food and drinks. The prices were decent and reasonable. I would definitely recommend everyone to eat at this restaurant when you are passing by Solvang. It's a nice and neat little town. Couldn't help but enjoy the great views sitting on the outdoor tables while enjoying delicious food and having the warm sun graze upon us. This place was a great addition to our weekend getaway.",4 star rating,John T.

6/17/2014,"Dallas, TX",Probably the cutest place and Solvang.  All I have to say is HOLY MOLY!  Delicious!!!!! I had the Buttermilk Friend Chicken Salad.  It was so so good and totally unlike a traditional fried chicken salad.  It had hushpuppies and dried cherries which is unusual but seriously so worth a try! My hubs had the pork sandwich and the kids both had the homemade pb&j.  No complaints from anyone in our group!   The only downside is I wish the restaurant portion was open for lunch.  We ate outside at the deli half of the place and it was fine just a little crazy considering Solvang was crowded.,4 star rating,Kelly R.
2/1/2015,"Seattle, WA",Came here with my family and a friend to show her around. The siracha fried chicken sandwich has a kick and they didn't just slather siracha sauce on the bread. They actually mixed it into the breading they used to fry the chicken. Each bite was delicious and worth the price. Unfortunately the patty melt my parents got was a bit too greasy for my taste but it's a patty melt so you get what you expect.,4 star rating,Cinthia D.

The restaurant has nice indoor and outdoor seating, and good service.

6/23/2014,"Milton, MA","Breakfast spot 2 of 2.  Satisfaction guaranteed at breakfast. Only 4 stars b/c I hesitate to rate too highly on a single visit... but the fact that i'm even rating at all is telling you folks that I got some shit to share about this place. Couldn't let it pass me by.  Even though it's already had 300+ reviews.  Yummerz.Hungry? Meals are big enough for two.  No, seriously.. I recommend sharing and if you know me, you'd take my word for it.  But I can understand how you would want to order something for yourself anyway..  But just consider that you're going to want to order the bloody mary with bacon ($9) and the house-made donut holes with mexican chocolate ($? a neighbor offered a taste, because they got too full eating their own meals)OK, breakfast instructions.1. Enter at the cafe, not the wining/dining room.2. If there's a line, have your partner grab a menu at the register. You're gonna need some time to read it over.  And over.3. Order at the register.  Pay.  4. Pick up your number and coffee mug; ask for a water, whatevs.  Then, find a seat in or out; arrange some tables to accommodate your many pals.5. Leave that number visible! Someone will serve your drinks and breakfasts shortly.Remember, these breakfast meals are BIG.Other food notes: - Perfect poached eggs - CRISPY fried potato chunks - enormous biscuits - many benees - MEAT (on your eggs, in your bloody mary, and on your meat, too)",4 star rating,Shaina P.
8/7/2014,"CA, CA","Really a 4.5. Everything was delicious. 1/2 star off because the service was a little slow. But, the food was so good, it didn't matter. We had the leek, almond goat cheese spread and the 2x2 as appetizer. The cheese spread was perfectly balanced. We were both so happy with the 2x2, everything was prepared with attention to detail. My husband got the 3 little pigs, I cancelled my beet salad because I was feeling full already. I'll try that next time. My husband's entree was great. For dessert, we were bold and got the bacon ice cream. The candied bacon was a bit much for me, but my husband loved it. The ice cream was so creamy and delicious. Looking forward to going back when we are in Solvang next.",4 star rating,Karma D.

6/28/2015,"Hermosa Beach, CA",Yummy cafe in downtown Solvang. I got the pastrami sandwich and fries. A little annoying that the sandwich was $13 and didn't include a side. The fries were an additional 4.75 but they did give you a lot and they could be shared. Cute little patio to eat outside or seats inside as well. No wait when we went but I've heard they can get a line out the door so you may want to call ahead.,4 star rating,Valerie A.
8/31/2014,"Los Olivos, CA","Made a reservation for a party of 6 for dinner at 5:30, that's when they open (kind of weird it's not at 5). Got a sticky menu, covered in jam. Forks and knifes in a mason jar in the center of the table. Mostly tourists dining here on a Friday night, ambiance was dark and pub-like. I wasn't too into the menu, mostly heavy pork dishes and a few salads, and very high in prices for the service. Some entries are in the mid $30 range. For that price I expect a tablecloth. I ended up just getting a salad, it was good. But some of the meals my friends ordered looked, not great. One got the scallops and said it wasn't that good. Our waitress refused to split our checks right from the start, I asked before anyone had ordered. That's kind of a dissapointment because pretty much all the upper end restaurants in SYV will gladly do that. When our bill came it was a total cluster ""f"" with all of us using a card and figuring out what to charge to who's. The waitress was not very friendly about it either. Of course there was a manditory 20% gratuity as well. It really took the fun out of going out, we had to basically do the waitresses job, and added about 15 mins of math and awkwardness to our dining experience. That's the last try I'll give to the succulent. I've tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All were pretty meh, breakfast was the worst.",2 star rating,Nicole B.
8/5/2012,"Santa Monica, CA","Gotta say this place is probably hands down the best restaurant in town. I give 5 stars reluctantly for moderate to expensive restaurants because with a higher price means higher expectations. Our server who was actually the only server in the restaurant helped design the interior and menu for the place. His sister, who also runs the catering, owns it. His passion and hospitality through the night made you want to cheer for their success too.Starting with the charcuterie platter to the bacon meatloaf, precision and care is put into every dish. The chef has a lot to do back in the small kitchen, but he is a master of his craft, both aesthetically, as well as palate wise. The homemade jams and oils were available for purchase, but I'd say the highlight of the night had to be the bacon. That word is quite possibly the answer to life, but here they make their own, nitrate free and it has a taste like no other. As a bonus they made an awesome apricot panacotta and even served McConnell's ice cream. For this avid Yelper I could go into detail about each dish, but that's not my style. Let me just say that if you're in town and are going to eat one meal choose here and you will not be disappointed. I'm hoping they will branch out, move south and expand their empire. Best of luck to the owners. Most restaurants could learn a lot from your example.",5 star rating,Scott A.
12/31/2012,"Hacienda Heights, CA","For Solvang, where most of the food here are a bunch of sweets, this place was pretty darn good.

8/27/2014,"Irvine, CA","Hit and miss!  The entrée I got was awful (pasta with disgusting sauce).  The service also sucked.  After bringing my meal we never saw the waitress again until she brought the check.....if she had appeared earlier I would have told her how off putting the dish was, my water glass would have been filled and we would have ordered more wine.  On the other hand my BF's entrée was respectable, not great.  Very disappointing!",2 star rating,Cherie H.
9/3/2017,"La Puente, CA",Biscuits with jam were good. The bacon they have in various dishes is thick but still has that chewy crunchy texture. Errol was the server for my group and he was very attentive to our needs. Goat cheese is excellent.,5 star rating,C T.

1/23/2017,"Long Beach, CA",I came here last year and just wasn't that impressed. I love the concept and the service. It's just the food didn't meet ambiance. The Brussels sprout app we ate was good. I had the 3 little pigs. Honestly when I got it I thought it was joke when they brought it out.  It's small but the price was large. It wasn't that special is what I'm getting at. I'll pay and be happy if it's like freaking tasty unicorns dancing on my tongue! But alas no unicorns. My gf got the meat loaf. It just wasn't that great either. The mashed patatoes were good. Don't know maybe we caught them on a bad day. But than again it wasn't busy either. So who knows?,2 star rating,R R.
12/15/2012,"Thousand Oaks, CA",The bacon wrapped scallops are to die for! I had the lamb chops which are really great. Service was exceptional.

12/9/2012,"Los Angeles, CA",We heard this was the best food in Solvang so we went with it for a late dinner. The food was excellent. I had the vegetable soup which was so fresh and full of amazing flavored and spices. Brussle sprouts are usually my favorite but  I felt they could have done a better job on these. They were braised with bacon but the only thing that really impressed me was te bacon itself. The sprouts were not cooked enough and didn't have much flavor apart from the bacon. My other half got the  short ribs and they were amazing! Literally my taste buds were going nuts hen I tried it. We also had an amazing eggnog bread pudding with a caramel-cinnamon bourbon sauce which went perfect with the Cabernet I was drinking.  The service was great too. The atmosphere was not as comfortable/cozy as I would have expected and they kept leaving the door open next to us so we were literally cold for the first 15 minutes.  But they fixed that when we brought it to their attention. Great experience other than that.,4 star rating,Andy H.

1/8/2014,"Glendale, AZ","Excellent. Went here for dinner on a Thursday night, we had no problem being seated quickly. Had the House Charcuterie and Artichoke Feta Dip for starters. The House Charcuterie was great, their meat selections were ordinary, but the actual product was awesome (Truffle-infused salami!!!). The Artichoke/Feta dip was ok, it was kinda sour for my liking.The highlight of the evening was my entree: Duck Breast & Confit. This item was recently added to the permanent menu. It was unexpectedly amazing. I felt like I was getting a well-prepared, high-end restaurant entree. The breast meat was flavorful and meaty. The confit was rich. I enjoyed the dish so much that I sent my compliments to the chef. This is a definite must try for meat eaters.The service was great, as well.",5 star rating,Philip H.

It was a great atmosphere, not too crowded, and the Charcuterie was better than expected. There were some things on the tray I didn't recognize, but it was ok. To my dismay, one of the things was yellow pickled beets. Let's just say.. I don't like beets..with a passion. There was something the server called caper berries, however. These more than made up for the beets. Solvang is a great place to visit, and this cafe is one reason for it. Thanks for the great experience",5 star rating,Donald C.
