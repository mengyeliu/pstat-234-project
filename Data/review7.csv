5/24/2021,"South San Francisco, CA","Lovvvvve seeing grandmas and grandpas in the kitchen.The wait for this place was 20-30 mins. We originally planned to go to another place down the street (and still did), but then decided to come here too.Got the Super Rica Especial and it came with three HANDMADE tortillas. The grandma (or mom) was making it on the front and you could see it from the all cash register. Grandpa was taking orders and money from everyone.That said, what we got wasn't suuuuper flavorful and the most spicy salsa wasn't spicy at all. The pork in the Super Rica Especial didn't have a ton of marinade and we had that on #11 taco too.Someone highly recommended the chille relleno, which looked pretty tasty, so I'd come back for that.There was a ton of seating, so definitely a great place to bring family. There was a picnic area behind this place and some seating in doors. I'd come before 1130am, when the rush starts.",4 star rating,Christina L.
4/20/2021,"Phoenix, AZ","This place is incredible. The chili relleno is the best I've had in my life. Hands down. The other food is good but next to the relleno, it's nothing. I love Mexican food and I've had many a relleno in my time but this one is by far the best. If you're in the area-try it. It's not overpriced like a lot of places in the area either. They have good covid restrictions as well, sanitizer is available, they're enforcing social distancing and mask wearing and it's only outdoor dining.",5 star rating,Kirsten Z.
4/18/2021,"San Francisco, CA","this is one of my boss's favorite spots in town (and also apparently Julia Child's?) they take cash only by the way and they have a small parking lot as well as some street parking. there's a few outdoor tables and a ledge where you can stand and eat as well. very limited indoor seating (it's really more for waiting for your food but some people sit) I ordered the vegetable tamal and the super rica especial while my friend ordered two steak tacos and also the super rica. We also got the horchata which was quite cinnamon-y but a bit too sweet for my taste. My friend loved it though! Vegetable tamal: (3.5/5) have never had a tamale before and I had no idea what to expect but this was delicious! The texture was great but it didn't come out super hot so that was a bit disappointing. The cream sauce on top is truly delectable. My only other note is that I wish it had a bit more flavor or spice (I added the spicy salsa and pico de gallo but it was still not to my standards) La super rica especial: (4.5/5) If you get anything here, I'd recommend you get this because it is spectacular. The char of the roasted peppers with the creaminess of the cheese and the flavor from the pork is...chefs kiss. They make their own flour tortillas in house (which is interesting as I'm used to corn) but the tortillas were really wonderful and a bit thicker as well. It comes with 3 tortillas but I honestly would've been happy with just the 1 since it was too big to pick up anywaysSteak tacos: (4/5) the steak was not dry which I usually get worried about - it was sooo juicy and jam packed with flavor. I would order this again next time too!",4 star rating,Stephanie N.
5/26/2021,"Queens, NY","At certain times, the line may be long, but no worries, because their turn around is quick. Everything is made to order, and it is a no-nonsense sort of spot. Know what you want before you get to ordering! Each taco is small, so you can try multiple different flavors. Note that the green sauce is VERY spicy (but very good!).",5 star rating,Jane H.
3/1/2021,"San Diego, CA","La Super-Rica Taqueria is a Santa Barbara/Central (CA) Coast institution. Its most high-profile fan is the late Julia Child, who could be frequently seen at this taqueria as she lived out her last years in Santa Barbara County. Ever since she praised this place highly in Bon Appetit and Good Morning America, the taqueria has been elevated to cult status. People from all over the country have been coming to Santa Barbara just to eat here, among other things. This is an honor in and of itself because the taqueria is located on Milpas Street, a bit of a walk from the main beach/State Street drag.I live in San Diego, where hole-in-the-wall taqueria joints are a dime a dozen and every local has their own preferred spots. While I wouldn't plan an entire Central Coast itinerary around this place I will rave highly about their corn tortillas, the best I've ever had. The secret is that there's a dedicated person that shapes the fresh masa into balls, pounds them into the flat, tortilla shape and puts the tortillas in the griddle along with the rest of the filling. Can't think of any place in SD that can make corn tortillas of the same quality, and the only other place I can think of that does them right is in Mexico. Due to its cult status, expect a line. Even on a Monday evening I was waiting in line for ~20 minutes and after placing my orders I still waited another ~20-30 minutes for my food to be prepared. Since everything is made fresh this is a natural consequence. Wasn't too concerned since I was on vacation and I made small talk with two people while waiting in line. As many people have pointed, cash only.At the time of my visit SB County was red tier yet the dining area was closed so the space was converted into a waiting area. There is another small area towards the front of the restaurant where you could eat your food. I took advantage of this because it would've been a 30-minute walk back to the hotel and I wanted to eat my food fresh. In hindsight this was a good decision.My orders:- #1, Taco de bistec (grilled beef. Served on two corn tortillas, $2.75). While delicious, the quality is similar to many other taquerias back home.- #16, Super-Rica Especial (roasted chile pasilla, cheese and marinated pork, on 3 tortillas, $7.90). I was told to get this from many sources. The spice level itself is very mild - I had to use salsas to make this a little more spicy. Pasilla chiles are used here to add more savoriness and smokiness to the pork and cheese. - Chilaquiles (corn tortilla strips lightly fried then cooked in a spicy tomato sauce, garnished with cream sauce, cheese, avocado, tomato, grilled green onion). Had these the next day. Not one of my smarter decisions but still good when heated in the microwave the next day. The popular items are their tacos, #16 and most things on their daily specials board. I hear that their pozoles and tamales are good but are only served on weekends. Guess I know when to time my next visit to this place.",5 star rating,Isabella B.
2/23/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Bottom line: You can tell by the homemade fresh tortillas, this is Truly one of the greatest Mexican restaurants in SOCAl. You're gonna bring CASH, because  La Super-Rica is CASH ONLY!During peak hours, be prepared for long lines. All orders are 'made to order'. You can expect 15-20 minutes wait time.Ordered their special (believe #16)? Roasted chile pasilla stuffed w/ cheese, with marinated pork and 3 tortillas.The homemade tortillas, are thick, doughy. No namely-pamby store-shelf dry taste. It truly makes a great 'taco' when you mix the marinated pork, and cut the Chile pasilla into pieces. Would recommend the cooling green sauce, not the spicy red. The spicy red will override the tasty marinated pork.The quality of the Chile pasilla with cheese reminds me of my other top-favorite Mexican restaurant in SOCAL in Los Angeles -- La Azteca Tortilla. The cheese/chili Relleno  burrito has similar palatable overlap.",5 star rating,Daniel B.
5/21/2021,"Hayward, CA",Make sure you bring cash because this place is cash only.  Food was very bland. Green sauce was not very good. Not sure what the hype is all about.  Overall the food was pretty basic. I've definitely had better Mexican food. Service was good tho so that's a plus.,3 star rating,Lan A.
2/26/2021,"Gilbert, AZ","Sometimes there positives about Covid like avoiding an hour-long wait at La Super-Rica. We had just two people ahead of us.We panicked when we saw it was cash only, but we at least had enough to order 4 items and leave a tip. Had they accepted credit, my husband would have ordered a few more things after tasting his frijol super rica and super rica especial. He was head over heels in love with his food! We live within a stone's throw of an authentic Mexican place in AZ, and he said Super Rica makes them seem like garbage. I got the rajas taco which was divine. How can you not love melty cheese and poblanos on two made to order tortillas? I also got a gordita which was good and definitely spicy, but the beans seemed dried out, perhaps because it was close to closing time.All in all, it was a memorable meal. My husband just wishes he could have tried more on the menu.",4 star rating,Stephanie T.
4/5/2021,"Goleta, CA","I came here for some tacos and left with 1 asada taco, enchiladas, adobada quesadilla and tri tip with sautéed veggies. The food was ok. The best thing I got was the enchiladas. The asada taco was pretty plain: just meat and the tortilla. I've never been here before so I didn't know they didn't come with cilantro and onion. I had to put a lot of pico de Gallo on it just to have flavor. The green salsa had a somewhat sour taste also. The adobada meat was marinated really good and so was the enchiladas. It was packed with potatoes, chicken, guacamole and came with some really good sour cream. If I ever come back, I'm definitely ordering just the enchiladas. Oh yeah and it's CASH ONLY! No cards. Remember that so you don't wait too long and end up not being able to order anything because you didn't have cash.",3 star rating,Jennifer N.
4/10/2021,"Milpitas, CA","From what I heard, this is one of the most well talked about taquerias in SB. Pretty sure everyone else heard that too because the line says it all. I waited about 20 minutes to order and then another 30 to get my order. BE PREPARED FOR THAT CASH ONLY!I ordered six tacos de adobado, one super-rica especial, one horchata, and one jamaica. There wasn't much seating available so I ended up taking my order to a local beach to enjoy. My order lasted well for the 15 minute drive as they were still pretty warm when I opened them. However, I realized that my order only came with five tacos instead of six. My fault for not checking there but I recalled hearing others missing items when I was waiting for food so check your order before leaving!Overall, I would say the food here is good but a little overhyped. I thought the taco was lacking some depth to it since it was just the marinated pork and two corn tortillas. Luckily I got some of the green sauce and pico de gallo on the side which added 10x more flavor. While I appreciate the freshness of the corn tortillas, personally not my thing for its consistency so I ended up omitting one from each of my tacos. By the time I got to the super-rica especial, I realized it was basically my tacos + chiles and cheese lol. I was pretty over the tortilla taste so just went straight for the meat. It definitely had more flavor without having to add the sauces but the flavor got repetitive midway through since it was the same meat from my tacos and it was semi greasy. The horchata was really tasty and creamy and the jamaica was refreshing and just the right amount of sweetness.TL/DR: Food is good but overhyped. Long wait  times. CASH ONLY. Get the green sauce and pico de gallo for tacos or else you'll be stuck with just meat and corn tortillas. Taco de adobado and super-rica especial have the same flavor profile. Get the horchata and jamaica. CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE.",4 star rating,Denise P.
3/26/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","1 freshly made tortillas -  excellent2 excellent pricing, though they don't show the pricing of the specials and sometimes those can be quite a bit more3. For those of you who want Mexican Coke- they have it 4. My favorite is the tortillas with guacamole.5. The meat tacos that my friend  were just OK. Not quite what we were expecting and he is from Mexico. Not far from San Miguel day and day and not far from where the owners are from in Mexico.6. I wish they had some vegan options",4 star rating,Hanna S.
12/20/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","It's December so that means tamale time! I have always loved the tamales at SuperRica. They are full of flavor but not heavy; even the sauce is light. The veggie tamale is chocked-full of veggie; there is the right balance of mais and filling. My husband had the pork one and it too was not too heavy and flavorful with a different sauce. There is also a fish tamale which we didn't have this time but it was good in the past.Don't forget, this is cash only business. We saw 2 parties leave once they figured that out. There was no line when we arrived but it developed while we were awaiting our order. Many people call ahead to order so you may have a wait even if you see no line.",5 star rating,Jenn M.

11/10/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","*** 4.5 stars ***Julia Child's favorite taco spot is definitely worth a stop. Is it worth an extra trip or an hour in line? That debate is still out to the jury but if you are in Santa Barbara and are craving some good, hearty Mexican food, this is your spot.  If you time it right, like we did, you'll only need to wait in like for 15-20 minutes. We seemed to arrive just before the lunch crowd, just before 11:30 am.  We were in and out in about an hour.The line is outdoors and people mostly stay distanced. There are some standing tables behind the restaurant in a large open space where you can eat (bring a picnic blanket if you have one!).We tried a bit of everything - tacos, quesadillas, tamales, soup... all was good, but I have to say the stand out and must get item is the Super Rica Especial - roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese, served with 3 homemade tortillas.  Everything is good, though. I found the meat quality of everything here to be higher than other Mexican places that I've been in Santa Barbara. It tasted authentic and was not too greasy.  Definitely not healthy by any means, but I didn't feel sick at all after eating all that food. We definitely ordered more than we needed to for two, but it was worth it to get to try so many different things, especially since the line that formed after we ordered was probably an hour long.Would I wait an hour for this? Perhaps if it was my first time coming here and I was seriously craving some good Mexican food, but probably not upon return.",4 star rating,Flora H.
5/27/2021,"Fairfax, VA",Fabulous food!! Simple but fresh and wonderfully tasty. We had heard that it was Julia Child's favourite Mexican restaurant...  and it was easy to see why.

11/17/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Long line to order at La Super-Rica TaqueriaCASH ONLYOrdered Tri Tip and it was cooked with bell peppers and onion. Standard stuff.It came with tortilla that was made in-house.Gave us three different sauces (pico de Gallo, mild red, spicy green).I guess there is an area that used to be their indoor dining area but food is only for take-out now. I personally couldn't wait to open up the plate so we stood outside on the vacant lot next door and ate our food standing up. Apparently I'm not unique in this because there were other people doing the same exact thing.We found plenty of parking spaces on the street surrounding this taqueria.",4 star rating,Kislev A.
4/18/2021,"Oxnard, CA",This spot is gross. This is not good Mexican food. Que pena me da! I got bistec tacos ( false advertisement). Don't know what beef that was but not bistec. The bistec is not bistec- it is thick beef meat that is bland and over cooked. It was also too thick to be called bistec and seriously dry as paper. The bistec i know is thin and juicy. I waited almost an hour to be disappointed. No flavor whatsoever. The salsa was ok and was so the horchata. Ok one star. True Mexican food lovers stay away. Santa Bárbara has better options.,1 star rating,Erica G.
8/8/2020,"Whittier, CA","Anything less than 5 stars would be CRIMINAL for La Super RicaIt's...flawless. Always has been, hasn't changed. You can't go wrong here.(#16) is very popular here, it's marinated pork topped with cheese and green Chile's. Super authentic and interesting flavor profile.The Chile Releno de Verduras is also hearty and amazing!Also, the fondue with chorizo is basically crack. Wonderful.",5 star rating,Linus L.

7/1/2020,"Mesa, AZ","Despite living in SB for years, this was my first visit to Super-Rica. I certainly have known all about the hype. For the most part, I'd say the taqueria lived up to it. Hand made corn tortillas: deliciousPechuga Suiza: tacos with grilled chicken breast and cheese=fantastic! My favorite!Fast and efficient workers The green salsa: Quite good Tacos de bistec: somewhat dry, flavorless, and disappointing. Prepare to hunt for parking on side streets and pay CASH only. Other than that, I think this is a great local place. I'd like to try some other tacos to find more as good as the pechuga I liked so much.",4 star rating,Christine B.
6/22/2020,"Temple City, CA","Brobro took a day off so we can go for a drive! We decided to make a pit stop at Santa Barbara to eat at Julia Child's (and mother's) favorite restaurant.Mother loves the salsa and their home made corn tortillas. She doesn't normally enjoy corn tortillas, but she enjoys Super Rica's! Since we came on a Monday afternoon, during the corona times, we were able to avoid the long lines that usually form out the door. The menu is what you'd expect at a local taqueria with some super rica specialties mixed in. I decided to try their quesadilla and a fish tamale from their specials menu. The quesadilla was the size of a mula/mulita and looked like one too! The chicken was nice and crispy, and the quesadilla was bursting with cheese. The fish tamale was delicious, definitely my favorite item. I enjoyed the cream sauce and the unique flavor of a fish tamale! Unfortunately it is a special menu item, so availability is limited.Yummy quesadillas and excellent tamal de pescado! Drop in for a quick bite if you're in the area, for the culture, hype and the gram!P.S.Cash Only!",4 star rating,Dora H.
4/12/2021,"Saratoga, CA","Just went in and ordered 5 items. The cashier did not repeat my order back so I assumed he heard me.

Amazing food though, according to my friends that did get some.",2 star rating,Shay P.
7/10/2020,"Las Vegas, NV","I read about this spot on several different blogs, apparently it as a Julia Child's favorite spot.    We took ours to go, which is all they are offering at the current moment during covid (July 2020).  We took it to the zoo d it was excellent.   I had the vegetable chili relleno-- AWESOME!! It's not on their regular menu but their Specials board. The sauces in the picture, I poured both of them on top and made a delicious topping.    We also tried the #13 Queso de Cazuela which was similar to a Queso fondito.  We liked it and he used it as a sauce his #1 and #4.   We went on a Thursday right around noon, the line went quick but we waited about 30 minutes for our order.  It was definitely worth the wait but it's not a quick pick up so allow time if you have to be somewhere.",5 star rating,Mel M.
11/11/2020,"South Bay, CA","When my guy ended his career in aerospace, he taught himself to cook. He watched hours of Julia Child prepare delicious food while she got a little tipsy sipping wine. His collection of Julia Child cookbooks are yellowed, dog eared and stained from years of cooking her recipes. He met her a couple times when she was alive and we even made a trip to Paris to outfit our kitchen with  copper pots from her favorite kitchen supply shop  e. Dehilleran (see my review: yelp.to/EWS5KTCllbb).To say he's a fan is an understatement so naturally when he learned about her favorite Santa Barbara taco spot we had to stop. That was many years ago but we've been several times and whenever we drive through Santa Barbara we make it point to stop for a slew of tacos. The menu is epic...if you can't find something to your liking here it's quite possible you just don't like family owned non pretentious little spots that cater to the locals. This place won't make the pages of Architectural Digest nor will it garner a Michelin star or plate but despite its non irenic lunch crowds the food here is super yummy. Tacos, tacos and more tacos; tamales, quesadillas,  chile rellenos and specials too. All sorts of meats, spices and salsas and sauces wrapped in fresh corn tortillas, or chilies or other special preparation, just like the delicious Mexican street food you know and love.Don't let the long lines frighten you...the line does move, just bring your patience hat and study the menu while you wait. I love this little place but it's been a while so we might need to take a little roadtrip north for yummy tacos....soon!",4 star rating,Sharon P.
5/29/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","This place can be described in one word, amazing! The food here is absolutely delicious and prepared from scratch.I had the chorizo quesadilla which I can honestly say is one of the best in the world.

11/21/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I tend to stop for some Super-Rica whenever I am in the area. I usually get asada tacos, guacamole, and rajas. The rajas are probably the best this side of Mexico. Tortillas are thick, fresh, and handmade. Not saying it is going on, but it is the perfect enterprise for money laundering. All cash business, doesn't accept plastic, tabs are calculated manually. Be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes before and after you place your order, regardless of how many are waiting in line. I have been subject to gringo prices, but the food is usually worth it. Park on the side streets. I have been disappointed that cafe de olla has not been available this year. The agua frescas are always refreshing, full of fruit, and not too sweet. For COVID your order comes in a box with five salsas, silverware, and napkins.",4 star rating,Aaron S.
10/18/2020,"Port Hueneme, CA",After eyeballing this place for almost fifteen years I decided to try these place out last week. There Tacos kind of reminds me of Tacos La Bonita in Oxnard but there meat is juicier and so is there salsa and it's in a homemade corn  tortilla. Great service from the staff. Parking lot is for three cars and can be kind of tight during busy hours. There is parking on the street. But definitely worth the drive.,5 star rating,Saul R.
3/25/2021,"Orlando, FL","Had a little weekend trip to Santa Barbara and made a stop here, was definitely worth it!

5/10/2021,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA","I'm a little bit annoyed that I waited 45 minutes for flavorless and average Mexican food. The tortillas are handmade and the food IS authentic but there really isnt a lot of flavor going on. I ordered the number seven  on accident thinking it was the number 8 It was beef with onions and peppers and again tasted decent but not something I would wait 45 minutes for. The guacamole is literally just mashed avocado and tomatoes there is no salt pepper or lemon juice added so it really tastes like something you can buy at the market. The ""Mexican"" rice is BLAND BLAND BLAND. Where are the spices? Where is the flavor? COME ON GUYS!!!! I'm sorry but this place in my humble opinion does not live up to the hype.

5/22/2021,"San Diego, CA","This is legitimately the worst Mexican food I've ever had, anywhere, bar none. Zero flavor in any of their dishes - pork, beef, chicken, doesn't matter. Even the salsas were bland and forgettable. And they don't even give you chips with your food. How does anyone even call this place authentic?

2/14/2020,"San Luis Obispo, CA","This place is virtually unchanged from the days when I first started coming here in the 1980's when I lived locally; about the same time that Julia Child put this place on the foodie map. Even after the foodies descended upon this non-descript taco stand, -- really nothing has changed. The food is well cared for and hand-made when you order it. Handmade corn tortillas. No parking, no decor, and you will have to be patient. You order ala carte plates at the counter and they call your number when its ready and you sit at cheap picnic style tables.Yes, there is often a line out the door. Yes, you have to wait for the food to be prepared. And yes, it is unique and mostly fantastic. On this last visit I had the chili relleno (is there any other dish in the world that can be prepared in such a variety of ways?) it came in a cream sauce with a delicious cheese stuffed chili with no breading. No breading being the key here. And two tacos. I recommend the marinated pork over the steak. The tacos are plain..mostly meat and tortillas. Not world class tacos--but we are just talking taco. The marinated pork was flavorful and I would get that again. It is easy to over order here--I would stay away from classic sides and just get the main events.",4 star rating,James S.
3/29/2021,"Topanga, CA",Trying this place 10 years later and I still believe this place is overrated. And I still don't understand why.

3/22/2021,"Honolulu, HI","I found this taqueria through a recommendation and I could not have been more pleased. I knew it was going to be good the minute I walked through the open doors and saw a woman making tortillas by hand. The double whammy was finding out that they only take cash - usually tell tale signs of a winner hole-in-the-wall restaurant. After extensive Yelp research, I walked straight to the register and ordered The Super-Rica Especial (#16). It was simply delicious. Roasted chile pasilla that cut through perfectly seasoned pork, topped with gooey cheese and encased in the most beautifully made tortillas? Say less. I found myself with an empty plate in no time and had even eaten an extra portion from a friend's plate. My friends got the vegetarian tamales which reminded me a bit of a deconstructed corn chowder. Nonetheless it was good, but not as good as the Super-Rica Especial. It's called the Especial for a reason and you should hurry down here and order it.",5 star rating,Alana A.

I get hungry just seeing the seafoam green trim when driving up Milpas.My favorites on the menu are the tacos de bistec, rajas, guacamole, quesadilla, chile relleno and super-rica especial. And horchata!This place is quintessentially California.",4 star rating,Natasha N.

12/15/2019,"Princeton, NJ","This taqueria is really hyped and famous, but I didn't think it was impressive, especially since there are so many better options nearby (e.g. Lilly's, Corazon Cocina, Taqueria el Bajio). The handmade tortillas are great, but the rest of the food seems toned down and bland with a lot of cheese/fat. I tried:#16 Super-Rica Especial ($6.80) - roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese, with marinated pork and 3 tortillas. The handmade corn tortillas were the best part: thick, plush, and flavorful. The rest had relatively little flavorful and a lot of cheese.#4 Tacos de adobado ($2.50) - marinated pork strips on 2 tortillas. The pork tasted simply of pork and char, which could be a good thing for some but personally I wanted more marinade flavor.-Tamal de verduras (I believe $8.40?) - this vegetable tamal is filled with chayote, corn, zucchini, potato, chile pasilla strips, and cheese, and is topped with a cream sauce. I was very excited to try this after reading the other reviews but it mostly tasted of corn and fat, and my mouth felt coated in fat after eating it.",2 star rating,Lena J.
11/15/2020,"Sunnyvale, CA",We ordered #1 (grilled beef) and #4 (adobaba/ marinated pork). I didn't realize these tacos only come with meat on them. They give you pico de gallo and red/green salsa on the side but the salsas were lacking in flavor and not spicy at all. The meat is cooked well and is slightly seasoned but I expected more from the salsa especially since the tacos came with no toppings.,3 star rating,Lynnette N.
7/7/2020,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","This definitely lived up to the hype! The flavors were delicious and really gave us a new appreciation for Mexican food! However, the wait was loooong. Understandable, I guess... And the portions were a bit small, so we had to go to Mony's after to get some snack tacos to fill us up. But all in all, we would visit again if we come back to Santa Barbara!",4 star rating,Melinda M.
4/28/2020,"Pasadena, CA","Covid 19 update For April 27, 2020 . I called on Sunday, they were answering the phone. He said chiliquiles would be on the special Monday. So I made the trip . Traffic was light from LA to Santa Barbara but heavier than I expected. At the taco place there was a line, but only 4 people and we were social distancing. Inside the cashier was taking to-go orders over the phone in addition to taking our orders. As far as parking went, there were 2 open spaces in their tiny 3 car lot, but I parked on Milpas.    After ordering I went to what use to be their dining area to wait, there were  6 or 7 chairs placed in a semi circle and since there was only 4 of us it was easy to keep distance.     The tiny neutral gender restroom was unlocked and I washed my hands 3 times while I was there.     The take out came beautifully packed in clean crisp containers. There is no self serve salsa bar at this time but the fellow at the window let me pick from pre- packed. He let me take as many as I wanted and yes, it tasted just like their usual pico de gallo. I love that stuff.      So the message from the cashier was ""we are all healthy "". When I told the fellow at the pick up window that I hoped they make it through this challenge the customer behind me said ""they will, he owns the building.",5 star rating,Sam V.
4/20/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","In these times, of ""we're all in this together"" and ""social distancing"" it is great to support the small businesses that are responsibly providing services and trying to survive.   When in Santa Barbara this is one of my Go To standard stops.  I called ahead and they said the wasn't much of a wait if I wanted to order on site.   On arrival, there were a few people queued up wearing masks spaced apart. It went quickly, the #16 Super Rica Especial is pork chiles and cheese is the most popular dish for good reason.  It's a must.   We also ordered 2 #1 beef tacos, the guacamole sauce is fresh and light.  Kind of reminds me of tacquito green dipping sauce, but much better.  On the special board was a tri tip dish so we gave that a try to.  Remember to load up on your salsa to go.AND, most important, don't be a puto and park in the red in front, we watch a Tesla get a ticket, the parking enforcement is not on furlough.  There is parking in the back and on the side streets.",4 star rating,Renee D.
1/19/2021,"Duarte, CA",Tacos are yummy. And they are very very generous with the meat. Ate asada which was good. Adobo which is to me al pastor also good. Tacos are good but they don't come with cebolla or cilantro. So that's .5 star off and the .5 star is for the green salsa which isn't good. However the red salsa is great and flavorful. Def would return and eat here when in town. The place is pretty small but does get busy. Also had The SUPER RICA. That was mouth watering. It's melted cheese with a Chile pasilla and asadas comes with tortillas on top you can make your own tacos. So delicious. Must try. It's like $7+ but worth it.,4 star rating,Aide M.
11/6/2020,"Los Gatos, CA","I was so hopeful after reading reviews that this taqueria was going to be epic, however I wasn't very impressed. Yes, their tortillas were warm, homemade and tasty but the tacos are served with only meat and very underwhelming. The super-rica plate with grilled pasillas, melted cheese, marinated pork and fresh tortillas was our favorite and if we only had this then I probably would have been happier. We got the steak tacos and the steak didn't have much flavor and was not tender. We should have tried the tamales, relleno, beans, or other items and probably would have been happier. We're also from the Bay Area and have some of the best taquerias ever so it's pretty hard to compete with what we are used to.",3 star rating,Jenna M.

11/2/2020,"Orinda, CA","Had high expectations given it's Julia Child's favorite place and it didn't disappoint. There were a couple vegetarian options, but it is mostly a meat heavy place. Everything we tried was delicious. It did take about an hour and a half to 2 hrs even at 2pm, so don't go if you're in a rush. Make sure to bring cash, they don't take cards. People were pretty close at the tables outside, so we took ours to go.",5 star rating,Emily F.
4/3/2021,"Pico, Santa Monica, CA","Really mediocre, relatively flavorless tacos. The tortilla was the only decent component. Meat was bland and over cooked. We waited 15 minutes in line, but then an additional 55 minutes for food. Not worth the wait. We overhead a family at the next table say the same thing! Skip it and find another spot.",2 star rating,Jl L.
10/7/2019,"El Segundo, CA","Delicious tacos! There are plenty of good Mexican restaurants in the area but La Super-Rica's strengths are there taco specials which are often piled high with a combination of ingredients born of their genius. My husband and I shared the #7 Tri-tip with grilled peppers and onions with bacon on top of 3 tortillas, the #16 Super-Rica Especial, and lastly, our feeble attempt at a healthy veggie option, the Tamal de Verduras, a delicious vegetable tamale.The portions turned out to be so generous that we were glad that we didn't order 2 items per person. I think if you opt for the tacos without all the fixings which are the ones typically ranging under $3, you may need a second item. But these special dishes were heaped high with toppings and we struggled to finish them. The #7 was a solid option, the excellent trip-tip cooked with the peppers and onions was smoky and delicious although a tad tough, and the Tamal de Verduras was the perfect pouch of homey goodness sitting on top of the husk it cooked in, drenched in a cream sauce which I need the recipe for right now. But the star was the #16. True to its name, it is really their specialty. The pasilla chile is charred at the edges and oozing all over with cheese with tender and nicely marinated pork pieces, all sitting on top of their housemade corn tortillas. Oh, and how could I forget, we ordered one horchata to share and I immediately regretted not getting my own. This was the real thing, generous in cinnamon and not watery in the slightest with a little bit of that graininess that comes from the rice. They have a nice salsa bar next to the pick-up window where you may ladle as much salsa as you please, but if you want limes, I believe you would have to ask and when picking up your food at the window once your number is called would be a good time to do that. Now for the details, parking is difficult with their teeny tiny lot only capable of holding 3 cars and not comfortably. You would also need the parking skills of a valet driver because once you park head-in, you'll have to reverse your way out of the lot, there's just no way around it. I also noticed some people sneakily double-parked in an attempt to do take-out orders but stuck around quite a while so if you're parked in the lot and want to leave, you may end up having to go hunting around for the owner of the car blocking your only way out. Aside from this miniature lot, your only option is street-parking on busy Milpas St. or in the residential areas which, much like LA, has street cleaning days during which at certain hours of the day, no car is permitted to park under threat of being towed. So do yourself a favor and watch for those signs. As for the atmosphere, it's really not bad at all. It's no Los Agaves, but their teal color scheme is cheerful, and the odd setup of a tarp serving instead of a roof in the dining area lets soft sunlight filter into the room casting natural but gentler sunlight into the area. It gives the feel of being out on a patio without all the discomforts. A really nice touch they added was placing machines that blow strong gusts of wind at the ceiling of each door threshold so as to blow away flying insects from coming in. This is so thoughtful because the last thing you want to do is eat while simultaneously shooing away flies trying to land on your food and do whatever disgusting thing they do. To me, they always look like they're plotting some evil rubbing their front legs together like some gross minuscule many-eyed villain. Glad to have fewer of those around while eating.When I went, the line wasn't bad but true to many previous reviewers of this restaurant, there was definitely a line so prepare to do some amount of waiting. They do keep the line moving fairly quickly though but maybe try to go during off-hours. Lastly, many have mentioned this already but they are definitely CASH ONLY. So stop by an ATM on the way.",4 star rating,Becky K.

We all waited in line with excitement! It turned out to be the highlight of our trip to Santa Barbara because the food was excellent. Their grilled marinated pork(#11) and tacos de chuleta(#3) are my favorite. They so tasty. Plus, they're generous with the meat and cheese. Don't sleep on their drinks! The horchata was perfectly sweet and flavorful. It was smooth to drink without a powdery texture. Jamaica was nice and tart as well. The salsas give a nice kick too! The red salsa was a hit.

The supple fresh-made corn tortillas are swarm off the comal for your taco or quesadilla. Full of corn flavor. Other taquerias wont come close with their store bought tortillas. I enjoyed a chcken quesadilla with oaxaqueno cheese and a rajas taco. I scarfed down on the side of the building because covid-19 testeiction closed their dining area, and marched right back and ordered 2 more before I drove back to L.A.

9/20/2020,"CA, CA","I have mixed feelings about this place. The tacos are good and the tortillas are home made but I seriously don't understand all the hype which surrounds this taqueria. We stopped here en route to Los Angeles. What we thought would be a quick stop for some tacos turned into a 1 hour, 15 minute wait. It took 30 minutes to order. There were around 6 people ahead of us in line. Then 45 minutes to get our food which was 4 tacos (meat and tortilla). I am compelled to write this review to let others know that while the food is good it may not be worth waiting an hour or more.",4 star rating,Sheila S.
1/14/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Overhyped, in my opinion. THE AMBIANCE:Taco shop with a window where you place your order and an outdoor, covered patio to sit.THE FOOD:I wasn't impressed. The tortillas are hand-made and fresh, which is the only reason I would give this place three (3) stars. The food we tried was not horrible, at best. The meat didn't taste authentic and was bland. This spot came as a high recommendation from a friend, so we arrived excited, but left very disappointed. THE TIPS:Expect a line. There don't appear to be many taco spots in Santa Barbara. I found a WAY BETTER Mexican restaurant later on in my trip, thank goodness.",3 star rating,Paola N.
8/26/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","The Parking: Street parking - metered or on the residential side streetsThe Line: We waited for about a half hour from getting in line to getting our food on a Saturday at 2:00 pm. You wait in line outside the restaurant which takes you inside where you place your order. You then grab a seat either inside (two or three tables by the ordering counter) or in the covered patio area. The Bathroom: There is one stall outside which is easily accessible and clean.The Food: There was no fish option when I was there. Expect a lot of cheese for non-meat eaters. The tortillas are hand made on the spot. I enjoyed the tomato and cheese taco but the rest of the dishes were just too cheesy and heavy for my taste. The experience might be different for the meat eaters. Most of the menu options consist of tacos, tamales and quesadillas. There were some specials of the day as well. But there were no burritos, enchiladas or other typical dishes you find at other Mexican stands.",3 star rating,Sandy H.

My wife says the food here reminds her of her grandmother's cooking. Our favorite item to order is the Gordita (a very spicy, bean filled corn pocket). They travel well and then when I am home, heat them up on the comal until they are toasty and crispy.

7/11/2020,"San Jose, CA","The good:  Home made corn tortillas, tasty guac, queso w/chorizo, and La Super Rica taco special tacos.The not so good: The regular meat tacos. It's just dry meat and 2 tortillas. Also, the salsas were just ok. There's no onions or cilantro for the reg tacos ( that's a taco staple!) We really enjoyed the queso and chorizo ( fundido/fondue) The order came gooey and melty in a small bowl w/ fresh tortillas. We added some of the guac and hot salsa to complete the taco. Overall- you're better off getting street tacos fr a truck if you feel like regular Mexican tacos. Choose this place only if you feel like a tasty variation of the reg taco.",3 star rating,Cindy J.

I thought LA had the best Mexican food but this place beats ever single Mexican place I've ever had!! There are even vegetarian options!It is take out only at this time but you are allowed to sit in their former dining area while you wait for your order number to be called.  The pork and vegetable tamal/tamales I had were both soft and full of flavor. The pork was seasoned well and the vegetable tamal (corn, zucchini, cheese) could have used a little more salt but I forgave that by dipping it in their spicy salsa verde. My kids got the cheese quesadilla which is made with their thick & chewy homemade corn tortillas. I have never seen them devour their entire quesadillas before (sorry, Mission tortillas). They certainly don't skimp on the cheese. The size is perfect for little kids or if you're an adult and want a small starter to your meal. The horchata is pleasantly sweet and spiced with cinnamon. My husband got the chorizo tacos which he loved.Don't be deterred by the line - they move fast and there isn't really a place to stand inside to wait so everyone has to wait outside while orders are taken inside one at a time.",5 star rating,Anita m.
7/12/2020,"Concord, CA","THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!Let me explain that strong statement. First off.. let's be real, tacos are pretty much always delicious as long as you're buying from mom&pop shops (aka NOT Taco Bell, Chipotle, Guadalajara Grill, etc). But these ones only have 2 things: tortilla and meat.The tortillas are made to order! There is a worker making tortillas constantly throughout the day, rolling, pressing, and grilling tortillas to perfection.Next, the meat is marinated delightfully. Had the chicken, steak, pork, and marinated pork. All divine and delicious in their own right.As I was eating, I had the epiphany that tacos are not about toppings (e.g. slaw, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.). The foundation is a great homemade tortilla and delicious meat. This taco accentuated this ideal and for that reason is truly THE BEST taco I've ever had.",5 star rating,Martin L.
12/3/2019,"Boonton, NJ","Wanting something that was authentic to Santa Barbara and off the beaten path, we wound up here after Seeing so many great Yelp reviews. It's definitely a small hole in the wall, with basic decor. Easy to miss if you didn't know what you're looking for. We didn't have to wait too long on line, which was a great benefit for lunchtime. And street parking was easy to find. It was clear that customers ranged from regulars to tourists, and everyone was happy. You can watch as they make the tortillas by hand behind the counter. Corn tortilla to be exact, and the freshness is delightful. The menu is large, so don't hold up the line while picking your options. And remember that it's cash only. When it comes to the food I thought it was good, but not great. Definitely appreciate the fact that it's all fresh and homemade, but it was a bit lacking for me. Literally just meat in two tortillas, without any sauce or flavor. You can add your own salsa, but I was sill missing the extra little kick to make me love it.

Expect long lines out the door, but it's definitely worth the wait! Remember to take cash, as they don't take cards.We ordered a couple tacos, a tamale and a quesadilla and while we were waiting for our food, we were enjoying drinking their salsa !! Every item was amazing but our favorite was the Rajas! This was hands down the best taco I've ever had and their pico is out of the world! Lastly, if this restaurant was one of Julia Child's favorites, who am I to judge otherwise",5 star rating,Aparna B.
9/20/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA",The best Mexican food in town. Authentic recipes made fresh to order. Don't skip the #6 or the Veggie Tamale special. Fresh guacamole is a must and if you like pork be sure to try the #16 La Super Rica Especial. Cash only!,5 star rating,Ryan T.
10/25/2018,"Pittsburgh, PA","This was the second taqueria in our two-part taste test for the best local taco joint. You can tell this place is a favorite because there was a line before they even opened, and everyone was ordering food for dining in plus more food to go. The man in front of us ordered something like 30 tacos plus another couple for himself to enjoy in the dining area. I wanted to crash whatever gathering he was catering! Or steal his lunch for the next five days. I give four stars because I personally loved Lilly's more. Don't get me wrong... the flavor of the food was excellent. I know why there is a line now. It's personal preference. I did appreciate the condiment bar at Lilly's. The one at La Super was more limited in options. The dining area isn't large enough to accommodate the crowd that comes to this place, but maybe that helps keep courteous people making their seating available as soon as they've finished. I encourage you to give this spot a try though! Maybe check out another spot or two in town for your own taste testing fun.",4 star rating,Torie B.

1/11/2019,"Rochester Hills, MI","Was recommended by a couple people in the area to visit. I have to say though, although food tasted great and the dining experience was very authentic and ""fun,"" I'd have to give 3 stars only for the following reasons:- long wait for food (not used to that for a place like this)- only cash accepted- sort of expensive for this type of food - portions were pretty small (debated going across the street to Domino's for some pizza afterwards)Overall I'd say a little over-hyped, and the expense category for the type of food should be one $ higher.

Sometimes the tamales are on special, make sure you get one of those.

8/16/2020,"Beverly Hills, CA","No no no. Ha, Julia Child probably went here only because she didn't know about Lilly's Taqueria on Chapala. This super rica place is ONLY so popular because Julia Child ate here. If you want your ho-hum menu with busy foo foo tacos, gorditas, and quesadillas and fajitas that are all Americanized, definitely go to the over-rated tourist trap--- super rica. But don't look for things like fresh steamed lengua. WHAT, no lengua??? I feel really sorry for all these tourists gushing over this place. It's food is the same you'd get at El Torito/Baja Fresh/Sharkey's.Truly, Super Rica has more customers than it merits, only so because Julia sometimes ate here in her final years. But it's not like she ate nowhere else but here, and get real--Julia was a master chef in many cuisines, but Mexican was not one of them. Worshiping her opinion on tacos, like mindless sheepies is dumb.Gosh, going there, I felt just like I was in Santa Barbara on Milpas St.Now, if you want simply delicious street tacos and only tacos like carnitas, beef heaven-ojo, lengua, cabeza, cachete, tripas, and just minced onions, cilantro and lime with bomb salsas, then go straight to Lilly's.

While waiting in line I seen a sign that said cash only, luckily a very nice local told me about an  ATM machine that was located 2 stores down.

Seems like there is several kinds of queso available. Or is it just me? I ordered the grilled pork and chile especial and a chorizo taco. My husband orders two tacos. American coke for him, and a Jamaica for moi. The wait is not that long.  A very small kitchen, but there is someone making fresh tortillas so hey now, I'm happy.  There is no dine in, and no outdoor dining so you need to take your food elsewhere (which we did, down to the park around the corner and had ourself a 4th of July picnic). The Jamaica needed more ice. The pork and peppers especial was exactly that + cheese and the portion was much larger than I expected.  The tacos were pretty big, and straightforward meat and tortilla, but really could have used some cilantro, onion and carrots to break up the richness of the meat.  Overall, I think the food was BASIC.  The service was pleasant, and I think it would be fun once the outdoor dining is open again.Would I go back again? Yes, but I would order something else. Maybe queso.",3 star rating,Bronwyn W.

7/14/2019,"Atlanta, GA","An unassuming corner stand that serves some of the most authentic Mexican fare! Their tacos are amazing, and extremely fresh; you can see them pressing homemade tortillas right behind the counter! I love the texture of the tortillas, the perfect balance of thickness and chewiness. They're sturdy enough to hold all the delicious fillings, which is exactly what you need in a tortilla. As for taco toppings, you can't go wrong with the more basic meats like grilled steak or pork. But, if you want some more flare, I highly recommend the Super Rica Especial and Alambre de Pechuga. If you intend on sharing with friends, I suggest each person order at least 2 different types of tacos so that everyone has enough to go around. I think the one downside was their system of calling out order numbers. When it gets too busy and loud, customers don't often hear their number being called, especially if they're not paying attention. The restaurant should have someone go around to check people's order numbers if a number has been called out for a while and no one is showing up to get their food at the counter.",4 star rating,Ronnie B.

7/3/2020,"San Clemente, CA","After waiting 35+ minutes for our food, I can say with the highest conviction it was worth the wait as their chorizo taco is the best I've ever had! The taco almost was a hybrid between having sausage at a top notch BBQ place like Salt Lick and with Mexican influences added. The adobo taco was also incredibly flavorful. I would pass on the Bistek as Guisados Bistek taco has more flavor and is more dressed up. The tamale simply melts in your mouth and is a must. The #16 Super Rica especial is as good as other Yelpers advertised and I found the cheese and poblano pepper in it to be exceptional. This is some of the best Mexican food out there & it's incredibly affordable as we spent less than $25. 5 stars without hesitation.",5 star rating,Alex K.

3/17/2018,"Denver, CO","After eating here several times now I can confirm it's probably my favorite Mexican eatery in Santa Barbara. The first time I was completely unimpressed because all I ordered was the Gordita de Frijol. But most of the dishes are really good. The handmade tortillas and queso are must-tries. My favorites are #7 tri tip and #16 marinated pork with pasilla pepper and cheese. And if you see a tamalito on the specials board, it is one of the best dishes I've eaten in town. It's this adorable and tender tamale-like gift full of chicken and spices that work.Horchata is good and the salsas including pico de gallo are not bad, though I find the dishes usually so flavorful they are hardly needed. It's true the restaurant is not the most clean but I haven't expected that of this type of establishment. Also I think for what you get, quality made-to-order dishes, the prices are fair. Tacos for $2.50 each and larger plates for $6.50 with three handmade tortillas isn't extreme in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Ashley E.

As a lifelong resident, I'd driven past this establishment a number of times, but never actually patronized it until about 10 years ago. Let me just say - this is some seriously good fare. One doesn't come here for the decor. It is rather basic and not much more than a glorified shack. However, it's clean, and the waitstaff are all friendly and accommodating. Cash only, so come prepared. Also, it's not uncommon to see a line out the door at any given time. Julia Child may have popularized this spot way back when, but the reputation still holds true to this day. I'm a huge fan of the tortillas. This location makes them from scratch - literally before your eyes as you order from the front kiosk. I'm also a big fan of their amazing guacamole - yum. Virtually any item on their basic menu is worth trying. Prices are decent for the quality of food you get. My recommendation would be to check this place out during an off-time like 3pm when the line isn't out the door. However, if you're keen on waiting, it's well worth it!",5 star rating,Eric G.

1/5/2018,"San Diego, CA","Mexican food in California has significantly changed since Julia Child endorsed La Super-Rica Taqueria as her favorite place to eat in Santa Barbara. How has this no-frills teal-colored Mexican outpost stood up to time? Is it worth a visit, or is it shockingly over-rated?I would personally not wait in the reportedly insane peak-hour lines to eat here, but I'd definitely return for an early Wednesday lunch when it opens at 11am, to dine among local newspaper-wielding seniors, which is exactly what I did when I visited La Super-Rica Taqueria. There was virtually no line, and I was eating within 10 minutes of my arrival. The ""Super-Rica Especial"" was the most expensive dish on the menu at $6.80, but worth it. Chunks of al pastor pork that have been marinated all-day share a plate with fire-roasted pasilla peppers stuffed with queso that melts and tastes like a Oaxacan cheese or dry mozzarella (and could actually be one or the other). The cheese acts as a binding agent, tempting attacking forks to pick up cheese, pepper, and meat all at once. With just a hint of delightful piquancy in each bite, this humble dish is not about heat as much as it is about the earthy, lush, multi-layered flavors of a Mexican home. The ""Super-Rica Especial"" is grade A certified ""comida de abuela.""  I was much less impressed by the ""Frijol Super-Rica,"" which is perhaps unfair, given the fact it is a side dish merely advertised as pinto beans with chorizo, bacon, and chilies, and is offered at a measly $2.55. However, I'd expect these beans to be more strongly flavored than they are with the chilies and pork products, but they're just slightly-above-average pinto beans by southern Californian standards.Both items are served with homemade corn tortillas, which are heated to an ungodly temperature and wrapped in foil in a way that makes them a hazard to handle when they're hot - so be careful. I was not and nearly became a statistic. I have admittedly been long-intrigued by the surprising shout out to ""La Super-Rica Taqueria"" in the second verse of Katy Perry's ""This is How We Do."" I must confess, I too was excited by the possibility of a wild night at this Santa Barbara institution, ""scarfin' tacos,"" and ""checkin' out hotties."" But I can assure you, my friends, this really isn't that kind of place, and hopefully never will be. Food/Décor/Service: 3.9/1.8/NA",4 star rating,Jay K.

This place is just EVERYTHING: taste wise, price wise, quality wise, selection wise. Everything about La Super Rica is just amazeballs. The tortillas here are made FRESH by the hardworking ladies -- that is so rare to find nowadays and almost unicorn like. I felt like I was being transported to Mexico where the street vendors still do things the traditional way. Hey not that I've been to Mexico myself but when I think of Mexican street tacos, that's what I visually fantasize. The mexican food here is outer worldly. This was my first time in Santa Barbara and never would I have thought that one of my most memorable experiences here would be at a neighborhood taqueria. The mexican food here beats out a lot of the fare I've had in my own hometown which is blanketed with taqs on every street corner.The findings: Tacos de bistec, chile relleno, la super rica especial, chorizo quesadilla , horchata. Everything was just ridiculously bomb.com but I'd say the standouts where the chile relleno (the mild cream sauce was just perfection), the super rica especial, and the horchata! The horchata was one of the best I've ever tasted, not too sweet and just the right consistency of creaminess. The especial's marinated pork was delectable in every sense of the word and paired perfectly with the fluffy housemade tortillas and the peppers.Cash only so you know it's good ya'll.",5 star rating,Connie M.

4/7/2018,"Dublin, CA","Our family of four got there for dinner on a Friday evening, there was a queue about 12-15 people deep to get in. I had read about this place being one of Julia Child's favorites so had to give this a try. We ordered multiple dishes wanting to try more and the prices almost justify trying multiple dishes. Being a vegetarian I had plenty of options. We got the guacamole, Rajas, Veg Tamale, Chile Relleno and the Quesadilla as vegetarian options for the family to share. From the meat dishes hubby got their especial I guess #16 on their menu and beef tacos. The tortillas were being made fresh on the spot. I honestly felt that the food lacked flavor though it did look very authentic. I really wanted to like the food but the white sauce on the tamale and the chile relleno probably killed it for me. The rajas were the best for me. For the meat dishes too, my husband had the same thoughts, he liked the especial more. Do get the horchata though, it was pretty good.Giving them credit for staying authentic and the fresh food. But taking off a star as it was a little bland.",4 star rating,Simpreet K.

12/13/2020,"Manhattan, New York, NY","This place is absolutely amazing, the food was fresh and seasoned to perfection, in fact we ordered so many dishes and not one of them disappointed us. The experience was incredible, in addition to the food because the man who took our order was so sweet and kind and really was patient with us because we did not know what to order and he really helped us figure it out based on our likes, there was also a sweet woman who clearly was a regular and helped us figure out what the fan favorites are at the place. We ordered the beans which were incredible and had an amazing sauce, we also ordered the enchiladas which were literally to die for I would fly seven hours every day just to get these enchiladas. We also had the chicken and peppers as well as the steak and peppers and both were absolutely incredible my mouth is watering as I write this. This was authentic food and it was so clear that the people who were making this food we're passionate about it and cared about their customers. And to top it all off we also had the Horchata drink which was better than any drink I have ever had in my life ever. The sweet drink was a perfect combination with the incredibly savory food that we had. I highly recommend this place and would go here every single day for lunch if I could. There is not one place like this in New York and it makes me extremely sad. I would literally give up my first born child just to have this meal again. (I don't have children but if I did, I really would give my first up.) Thanks to this incredible business keep up the great work!!",5 star rating,Jay L.
12/12/2020,"Milpas, Santa Barbara, CA",Definitely would not recommend! I don't really get the hype around this place. The meat on the tacos were extremely bland.

9/6/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I came here at a random hour and the line was so long and crazy. For that wait, I thought the tacos were okay, nothing super amazing. It may also be a preference too that the tortillas, although handmade, reminded me too much of a tamale consistency/flavor. I guess I'm just a white-washed taco lover. I also found their meat to be dry and on the more bland side.Food took awhile to come out... and I do love hole in the wall places, but this place was super dingy and DIRTY. So many flies everywhere, trash to your left and right... etc. They ran out of sauce /pico de gallo (and they weren't placed on top of ice if I recall correctly). Did anyone else notice their health score on yelp is 55/100? Perhaps I've been spoiled by Mexican food in San Diego and LA so I thought this was okay and I probably would only go if there wasn't a long wait.",3 star rating,Janet H.

The food was unsatisfying.",2 star rating,Audrey F.
7/3/2018,"Malibu, CA","My favorite Mexican restaurant, probably ever but definitely In Santa Barbara. To note: also Julia Child's favorite Santa Barbara Mexican restaurant. The flavors here are strong, bold and authentic. The ambiance is non existent, but in some way it's part of the charm? I do like the turquoise trim so that's a plus. Occasionally I feel frustrated with the lines out the door, other tables immediately abutted against you while dining- but then I consider the fact of how good their food is. The fact that I never wait in lines generally. That it is insanely reasonable! And then, when I receive my food, I realize how all worth it it has been because their flavors and the quality of their dishes is outstanding. Walk up, check the chalk board menu and order accordingly. You can see the girl making corn tortillas by hand, one by one. This place is Cash only & my favorite Mexican restaurant",4 star rating,Stephanie L.
8/5/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","This place must have some kind historical significance or has been visited by celebrities from around the word. A thousand plus reviews and 4 stars?? Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad at all. It was pretty decent but there is really only one thing here from what I tried that separated them from the competition. Corn tortillas. Looked on Yelp to see what was good and decided to settle on #7 Alambre de filete which was tri tip with bell peppers and onions. It also came with 3 home made corn tortillas. The steak was marinated nicely and wasn't overly dry. I wish it was a little less cooked because well done steak made it a little drier. Bell peppers and onions were seasoned nicely too. But man those corn tortillas. Thick and flavorful   Perfectly matched the steak and vegetables. I also ordered the pork tamale which had a white creamy tomato sauce. Honestly, nothing really special. Not a whole lot of pork inside and the tomato sauce was so so. I almost would have preferred it dry and put my own salsa on....except the salsa bar was whatever. 3 options and none of them really stood out. Servers were nice but there was really nothing much to it. Typical Mexican place bordering more on the traditional side. Prices were reasonable but not necessarily cheap. It's also cash only and stays open until around 10. I probably wouldn't come back if I were to hang out in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Kevin J.
7/1/2017,"San Jose, CA","My boyfriend and I saw this place in a video highlighting must go places in Santa Barbara on TripAdvisor. Seeing that this place had pretty good ratings and the line that was out the door right at opening, I thought this place was going to serve the most bomb Mexican food ever. Overall, I thought the place was just okay. My boyfriend said he'd give it 5 stars.We ordered the rajas, tacos de bistec, guacamole, and agua fresca de sandía. I was pretty surprised when the total bill was only $13, but I soon realized after I got my food why. I completely misunderstood the menu when it said the tacos come with two tortillas - silly me I literally thought each order came with two tacos. Anyways. The tacos de bistec was good, but wasn't amazing. My boyfriend had to eat the rajas because I was not a fan. The guacamole was good however and definitely stood out along with the agua fresca de sandía (which was a definite must get).Meh, I've actually had better Mexican food in San Jose. Oh and this place is cash only!",3 star rating,Joanne Y.

9/21/2020,"Woodland Hills, CA","Been coming here since the late 80's and it was always amazing and wonderful. Unfortunately the last 3 years I have gone, there has been a major deterioration of the quality of food though. I actually stopped going for about a year and yesterday thought to try it again. It was a mistake. I got the La Super Rica Especial (chille pasilla, cheese and crumbled pork). It was terrible.The chille was burned to crisps. The meat tasted ... well, like nothing. There was no flavor or anything. I also got my usual #8. Used to be one of my favorites. They skimped on the chicken WAYYYY down! And the veggies were soggy. There was no mushrooms. They used to put that back then. It was just onions and green bell peppers. Lacked salt and pepper and any flavor really.  The only good thing about Super rica now is the tortillas which haven't changed and seeing the owner and his son/ the establishment still standing.  The food is now mediocre at best and the prices have basically doubled in the last 5 years. Total bummer.",3 star rating,MIna M.

5/31/2019,"Chino, CA",I think all true foodies can attest if there's a long line outside its probably good! This place came on the fly as we were in search of something memorable before heading back home. Not only did it pop up in the search at the top of the list we actually had drove past it a couple of times lol. Parking is scare as the side streets are quite small and there was construction being done on the back side. Although there was a long line the wait wasn't too bad as we engaged with the locals as well as a family from Australia.

3/23/2017,"Columbus, OH","As Mexican eateries in the US go, La Super-Rica Taqueria is just about perfect.  I'm obviously excluding from this statement the line to order food, which wasn't present the last I ate there (admittedly five or so years ago).  My most recent visit was at 3PM on a Saturday, and it still required about a 10-minute wait.  So you probably want to go off-hours.  The line moves reasonably fast, at least.I love the modest, simple vibe (an essentially open-air dining room, with a canvas roof), which belies the excellent execution of the food.  Everything I've ever had from La Super-Rica has been tasty, although if I had to pick a couple dishes, it would be the Chiapas-style tamale (chicken and masa wrapped in banana leaves with figs and mole) and the vegetarian chile relleno (a vegetable stuffed with more vegetables), which I haven't often come across in the US.If only I could get Mexican food this good in Ohio, then I would die happy.",5 star rating,Richard P.

The Gordita with beans is another good veggie option.",5 star rating,Molly W.
5/7/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","OK I really really don't understand the allure of this place. I've tried a big sampling of everything on their menu, and it's just not that amazing. It's like a mix of simple easy things one can make in their kitchen. The part that bothers me about this place, aside from the food not being as amazing as everyone made it sound, is that they're clearly not putting any money they make back into the establishment, and that always worries me. This place is too successful to have gross bathrooms,  food served on paper  plates,  and old plastic patio furniture as their seating. Perhaps it's just me, but for the legions of fans this place has, I just really felt it was kind of a joke.",2 star rating,Jay D.
3/27/2017,"McKinney, TX","I'm still a little speechless about this place. I was extremely disappointed AND we waited in line for at least 45 minutes! My girlfriend and I ordered Tacos de Bistec (#1), Tacos de Adobado (#4), Lomito Suizo (#11), guacamole, and special tamale of the day, and horchatas. The meat on the tacos were extremely overcooked. I had to use a ton of salsa and guacamole because it was really dry. The only highlight were the homemade tortillas. The Lomito Suizo had so much cheese and not a lot of meat in it. The horchatas were really sweet too. The special tamale was actually the best part. It was a little different with raisins, almonds and boiled egg but the masa was really moist.

Today we decided to take our children and make this our lunch treat after a very exhausting soccer tournament. We kept typing up our kids about the food and how amazing it was. But sadly this was not the case anymore. The meet was so dry that you could barely make enough saliva to swallow it. Not to mention it had zero seasoning. We had the steak, adobada and chorizo.  all three options were terrible. The only good thing that still remain the same with the homemade tortillas and the cheese dip (cazuela).  Needless to say we threw away half of our food because it was an edible.

Not only is it not the best Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara, it's not even close to being the best Mexican restaurant on Milpas Street.  Anyone who wants a serious taste of Mexico do yourself a favor and take a walk down the street to Los Agaves, or Tacos Pipeye if your in the need for some real authentic tacos.",1 star rating,Roberto V.

12/30/2016,"Mountain View, CA","Simple, no frills, delicious tacos - especially love the fresh corn tortillas. But we waited a solid 1.5 hours before the tortillas actually touched our tongues - won't be doing that again! You can drive to equally delicious taco joints in LA in 1.5 hours and wait no more than 5 minutes. Of the things we ordered, the highlight for me was the super rica especial. Delicious meat and cheese sandwiched between 2 fresh, fluffy corn tortillas. The chorizo in the chorizo taco was also very tasty - but the taco itself was quite plain and relied heavily on the amazing, slightly spicy pico de gallo. We also ordered the special Chiapas style tamale - a mix of mole, nuts, dates and chicken. Not exactly my cup of tea. The only agua fresca left by mid afternoon was the Jamaica - which was far too sweet. Service is very slow. While the man helping us at the register was very sweet, he definitely took his sweet old time. Can't blame him if people are crazy enough to wait in line despite it!",3 star rating,Jen H.

Day before yesterday, I took my girlfriends mother for her first meal there. She's English and a very picky eater. She told me she wasn't hungry so I told her not to worry and just go sit down at a table while I ordered. I ordered 2 of the tacos adobada,  2 of the tacos de rajas, 1 pork chop taco, one guacamole and Atole. I figured that I could take all leftovers home. When I brought it to the table she timidly took a bite of the Rajas and it was all over. About 3 to 4 tacos and it was over. No leftovers. The Atole was amazing by the way. Not to thick and starchy.

You want fast go to Taco Bell you cheap ingrates. And for the complaints about it being cash only if you were ever able to manage successful business you'd understand that if you could demand cash only and get it you'd be a success. We should all be so lucky as to have created something so amazing that his lasts for so many decades that we can do man cash only close on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and everybody waits anyway.And as always anything this good that gets popular gets the typical ""I know a better spot"" posts.

You basically order standing up at the cashier, while tons of cooks are slaving away at what smelled short of heaven. They have about 20 things on the menu, including some specials, all at an excellent price. I would hardly call it ""Mexican"" as they have a variety of plates that seem like a combination of South American dishes. They make it fast, but boy do they make it good. All in all, it's not a fancy place but if you're looking for fast food that won't disappoint your tum or bum, get yourself to Super Rica. Also, GET THE GUAC.",5 star rating,Sayeh Z.
6/26/2016,"San Francisco, CA","The line was out the door around 2:30pm on a Sunday. It moved fairly quickly, taking about 15-20 minutes til we could order. After that it was maybe 5 minutes for our food to come out. THE COST: About $17 total for a light lunch for two.1) Tacos de Bistec ($2.50) - 4 stars. A tad dry if I'm being picky, but the steak still had great flavor.10) Quesadilla con Chorizo ($3.50) - 5 stars. Amazing chorizo! These are actually sliced sausages, and they are super rich. A bit heavy on the cheese, still great overall. 16) Super-Rica Especial (chile pasilla, cheese, marinated pork. $6.80) - 4.5 stars. Definitely lots of pepper, but goes well w/ the cheese & pork. Comes w/ 3 tortillas, easily makes 3 taco's worth of food.",5 star rating,Ziyan C.

9/26/2018,"Redondo Beach, CA","I was extremely excited to try this place on my day trip to Santa Barbara. We waited in line and for our food for a total of an hour. The incredibly long wait reaffirmed our beliefs that the food would be amazing and worth the wait. Plot twist, it was not. I don't know what Katy Perry and Julia Child loved so much. We ordered the super rica especial, the frijoles super rica, and a few tacos. Everything was bland and tasteless. The meat was very chewy. The only decent part was the horchata and Jamaica we ordered. To make things worse, the bland food that we waited an hour for did not sit well with both my girlfriend and myself.We highly regret wasting a chunk of our day here and partially ruining the rest of our trip due to our upset stomachs.",1 star rating,Jasmine H.
10/9/2017,"Northbrook, IL","You know a place is good when you arrive to find a line stretched down the block at 8:30 on a Thursday night.My father-in-law picked this out of a Santa Barbara travel guide for our dinner option one night while in town. I'm only mad he didn't choose it earlier in the trip so we could have gone more than once. We ordered way too much food because we wanted to try as much as possible. The guacamole was well-seasoned and the portion was huge. I loved the marinated pork -- it was tender and flavorful. The chile relleno was perfection. And, honestly, the horchata was so good it has ruined all future horchata for me. Bring cash and a good dose of patience. Make friends with the people around you in line. And enjoy the experience.",5 star rating,Stacy O.
9/17/2018,"Burbank, CA","You're thinking of trying this place out. I just did, and I think your first experience will be similar to mine. Here's how it's going to go. 1. You're going to circle the block once or twice before parking across the street. 2. You're going to try to get a glimpse of the menu while you're still standing outside. An enthusiastic stranger next to you might make a recommendation. If not, allow me to pass one on: try the chile relleno (daily special). But you're hungry. You'll want to order something else too. 3. That's when you'll realize this menu is pretty difficult to take in. The handwriting is tidy but it's just not customer-friendly. 4. But you look up and down and up again, and you realize that they don't sell burritos. Dang. How about shrimp tacos? Nope. Fish? No fish tacos either. 5. You like meat and veggies, so #7 is a no-brainier. Cash only. All good, you planned ahead. 6. Off to the salsa bar. You'll take one of each. And now you wait for your food. 7. Yeah you're still waiting. How long has it been? This place is busy, but it's not THAT busy. Why is your food taking so long?8. Whoa. You weren't expecting the food to look like that. Maybe throw a little salsa on it just because you have it, but not too much. Whoa. That's tasty. The salsa doesn't really help much. You're not going to put any more on. 9. That was pretty darn good; nothing like the other taquerias you've been to. What a unique experience. You should post a Yelp review. Boom.",4 star rating,E R.

We waited for 45min in line and 20mins for our food to be ready. I ordered bistec tacos and a quesadilla. The bistec tacos were a huge pass for me. They did not have any flavor whatsoever, and they are served plain. They do have sides of salsa and pico but it was not enough to make the tacos more flavorful.The quesadilla was good. I don't mind waiting if the food is actually worth it. I can't speak for the other food they serve but if you're looking for a good taco place this is not the place.",2 star rating,Kat M.

Don't skip it!Also, something to be aware of, in case you're very hungry or maybe have young children in your pack, is that it's not at all quick. The line just to order was quite a long wait outside, & once we sat down, it was still quite a long time. I'd suggest going before you're hungry, but you won't be disappointed.",5 star rating,MG M.
12/29/2015,"Saratoga, CA","Expect to stand in line for a while. Came here at 11:05ish on Sunday, and there were people waiting already. The sign still said ""Closed"". It wasn't until around 11:30 when the line finally started moving. Maybe they just opened 30 minutes late today? They never flipped the sign to ""Open"", though.My parents and I got the first 3 tacos on the list, chicken and cheese quesadilla (#12), and the enchiladas. The highlight was the freshly made tortillas. The enchiladas was generously filled with shredded spicy chicken and had heaping scoops of guacamole. Their tacos are simply 2 pieces of tortilla with the meat. They have salsa which you get yourself that you can add to the tacos. Definitely order a few tacos, because each order only comes with one.No burritos, just a heads up. My dad loves burritos, so he was disappointed that they don't make them. They also have several beers and drinks. Get a Corona or Modelo with your meal! $3 for beers; not bad. Overall, the food was good. If you're into tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tamales, and ""smaller"" Mexican bites, check this place out. They make their own tortillas, which makes all the difference.",3 star rating,Christina W.

The seasoning on the meat is just right and all items were piping hot and DELICIOUS. Highly recommend the steak quesadilla. The pico de gallo was spicy with its slivers of jalapeño and salas had the right level of heat. We loved the homemade horchata made fresh just like the tortillas. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon, 3:00, and service was friendly and quick, no line. When we passed by in the evening(7:00 pm) there was a long line of about 25 along the side of the restaurant.

7/6/2019,"Tacoma, WA","Returned here after a long hiatus, I live one block away and never eat here. I watch so many park on my street and walk over. I see the long lines, I really want to like it. I decided to give it another try...sadly I regret the $40 I could have spent at Los Agaves instead, We ordered a variety of items, so many things sound amazing. With so many in line daily, I felt like I must be wrong. I bring the order home to my wife after waiting a lengthy amount of time for a to go order. We ordered a little bit from each section of the menu wanting to really give it a fair chance. Unfortunately, the only thing I truly enjoyed were the homemade tortillas. Neither one of us liked any of it. It was either bland or way to cheesy or greasy. I'm not really sure what the draw is, there is so much amazing Mexican food on Milpas, this just doesn't hit the mark for me.

Their one of a kind dishes are simple, but honestly the best thing ever when it comes to flavor. My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Chorizo and cheese, which is basically just cheese and chorizo served with tortillas.....and it's the best thing ever! I CANNOT replicate it, even how hard I try. Some things to know before you go...-It's cash only!-The line gets really long, so know what you are ordering before hand to not anger those waiting behind you. The menu is only posted inside, which overwhelms those who have never seen it before. I recommend looking at the menu via yelp beforehand and writing down numerically, like 2 #10 and 1 #4-eat there, not to go. Most everything has cheese, and cheese solidifies. To get the full experience, you want to ooey goey cheese warm and fresh.",5 star rating,Sadie S.

8/27/2017,"Saugus, CA","This is not a bad review. BTW Cash Only! I've known about La Super Rica for over twenty years and I finally stopped in while driving through SB. So long ago, that even my Zagat guide had it listed. I just couldn't bear waiting in a long line at a taqueria because I'm usually starved. Ok, here's the real deal. Their meats are all flavorful and for the $2.50 per taco with two home made tortillas, you can easily make two tacos out of one order because they give lots of tasty meat. I tried the tamale and it was not flavorful until I put salt on it. They are thin and not like your typical masa loaded tamale. The gordita had no flavor either. Now, the OFF THE HOOK Pozole soup, the best I've ever had. Flavors were spot on and it was loaded (see picture).I also had the ""taco de hongo"" (mushroom) and that was huge and very flavorful, I've never had sauteed mushrooms like that. You could make four tacos with all the mushrooms they give you.Your best bet is to see the limited menu online. They don't have burritos, fried tacos, taquitos, chips, etc, that you would normally get at a taqueria. Would I go back? Yes, I would for the pozole and the mushroom taco but not if the line was around the building. To sum it up, it's like Tito's Tacos in Culver City, some people just get used to that taste.",3 star rating,Frank R.
7/22/2017,"Bakersfield, CA","On a recent day trip to Santa Barbara, my cousin and I made it a mission to seek out this taqueria popularized by a Katy Perry tune. However, after eating here, I think it's the other way around. We arrived shortly before opening and only a single couple were ahead of us. When we left, the line was out the door, halfway toward the small parking lot. La Super-Rica Taqueria is not merely a taqueria but an institution. It demands unwavering loyalty among my UCSB friends and from the first bite, I can understand why. We wanted to sample as much as we could and the cashier was more than helpful. We ordered the Tacos de Bistec, Tacos de Chorizo, Alambre de Filete, Quesadilla con Chorizo, and Gordita de Frijol (we were going low-calorie, obviously). We didn't mind that it took a bit of time for our order to come out as we could smell the fresh California-sourced onions and peppers cooking and watched as the handmade tortillas were prepared. And don't get me started on the salsa bar featuring the holy trinity of salsas: Pico, verde, and a orange habanero. I was in Mexican food heaven. Now to the business end: The first taco I had was the chorizo. Instead of the typical ground meat variety at other taquerias, La Super-Rica Taqueria features the sausage form which had the bite and texture of a linguica and was smoky and peppery. The bistec was tougher than the typical carne asada but had the grittiness and robustness of a tri-tip. The Alambre was like a mini order of fajitas with caramelized onions, peppers, and bacon - the later of which imparted a fatty richness to the dish. The Quesadilla - more than any other dish we had - showcased the magic of handmade tortillas: You could taste the quality and instantly regret every tortilla you've ever eaten. Finally the Gordita had a spicy bean filling which appeased even my cousin who fastidiously claims she doesn't even like beans. I can't recommend La Super-Rica Taqueria enough. It's one of the few places along the Central Coast that is truly worth the drive. If you find yourself in Santa Barbara, make the trek to this tiny taqueria off the 101: It's one of the best tacos I've had, and I've lived in Southern California all my life.",5 star rating,Ty T.
4/5/2016,"Renton, WA","This place is not to be understated. These tacos are freaking DELICIOUS. The freshly made corn tortillas and the freshly grilled meat, THE HORCHATA (and I typically don't care for the stuff)!!! Everything was amazing. We had #1, #11, #9, and a Coke and horchata. Be warned that your taco comes quite plain...you need to order guac separately ($3.50!!), but salsa is free, and it's good.

My favorite dish probably has to be the tamal de verduras, it never disappoints. The tortillas are hand made which is always better, the vibe is just great as well its like going to your grandmas on a Sunday afternoon eating great food and enjoying company.

We came here after so I decided to get something here tooGot a #1 and a #3.The meat is seasoned, but along with 2 tortillas, that's all you get. It is $2.50 and cheap (some $3.50) but you get a good amount of seasoned meat (bistec/steak) and you also get some salsa (mild, medium, hot) but that doesn't really do too much to help out.I might be biased because I came here second after having an amazing lunch earlier. :/Also flies and dirty tables. Wait times are pretty chill, staff are pretty chill as well.No a/c, roof on top but the sides are open. :-/Los Agaves.

I do like how you can watch the kitchen while you're standing in line outside though. I ordered the tamales with cream cheese sauce since the sauce seemed to be their signature item here. It was definitely yummy at first taste, but it did become bleh after more and more bites. The sauce isn't as weird as it sounds either...it's just very creamy and cheesy!

I was in doubt, because I never had any taco that was impressive in my life. Well, before this place.I was surprised. it is not cheap for charging one taco ~$2.5, but they come in good amount, so you probably would be full after 2 or 3. The toppings are pretty generous. We don't eat meat, I thought there would be very limited choice. But among the few choices, they were actually all pretty tasty!The most impressive one was #6, with chile and cheese. It has a great amount flavor in it. I can't tell what type of broth they use, but the whole thing is very delicious, and with enough-not overloaded salt. And together with the warm, house-made tortilla, I just couldn't stop! (forget about my low carb diet). We also had the quesadilla, was good with the red hot sauce. The bean's taco, which was baked and has a lot spicy kick in it. The guacamole taco, that was a lot of avocado!!! Very fresh, need a little more salt though. And their mexican coffee.

The tortillas here are handmade on the spot and you could tell they were a cut above anything else in the area. The guacamole was also particularly authentic and had a good amount of zest to it. If you are particularly parched the watermelon water is super refreshing and paired well with the tamales. I also enjoyed the tacos de bistec with melted cheese on top. Its a little more expensive but the melted cheese option is a total game changer. There is no dedicated parking lot so finding a spot can be a bit difficult and aesthetically the place looks like a hole in the wall.

It's hard to find seating on the patio, so its best to grab your order to go. The food is good and never disappoints. Besides the lines, the other downside is that it's cash only.",3 star rating,RC R.
3/30/2017,"Huntington Beach, CA","It's all about the meat for me when it comes to tacos. So even though the quesadilla and tamales, plus the handmade corn tortillas were delicious here, I still had to go with 3-stars for the meat. Meat in the tacos were overcooked, dry, and under-seasoned. If it wasn't for the guacamole and salsa, it would've been hard to eat. Also, price is for each taco (roughly $2.50 each) so you can eat it as two tacos or one taco with two tortilla. Also, where's my cilantro and onion garnish?",3 star rating,Qui C.
9/17/2018,"Silver Spring, MD",Hole in the wall but good food. Bring cash and the specials may have been underwhelming. What I mean is the a la cart tacos were better than the specials.  Would have given 4 stars but there were flies inside.,3 star rating,Chi Z.

4/24/2018,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA","Still my favorite clean, simple tacos in Santa Barbara. If you want just simple charbroiled meats and housemade tortillas, and basic pico de gallo salsa to hit your tongue, they fulfill that so well. You can taste the quality of their meats, the flavor of their char, it's just so simply good. Almost every table had the chicken with mushrooms, peppers and onions tacos. Not sure why. This isn't their best thing. The charbroiled beef steak and pork steak are wonderful. The taste of the meats are as good as it gets. It's almost as if they don't marinate them, and just simply add salt and pepper, because the natural taste of the meats is what makes them shine. I passed by other tables and saw something like a pozole taco, if there's such a thing. I'm going to try those next time. Great, consistently good place from someone who has been coming here for over 10 years now.",4 star rating,Anna K. S.

Sorry La Super-Rica.... o used to love coming in every time we would be in the area or driving through but lately, a lot is left to be desired. The specials are still my go-to, love love the Chile Relleno with cream sauce. But the meat tacos portions have grown smaller over time as well as the size of the tortillas that I dream about. Pretty bummed. Our last there was quite disappointing.2 stars for the super friendly guy at the cash/order window. He is so sweet and always smiling.",3 star rating,Lily W.
12/24/2018,"Santa Ynez, CA",My husband's favorite place for chiliquilies. My favorite for their veggie tamales!

1/7/2017,"Oceanside, CA","Don't waste your time standing in line here. The tacos were not impressive and the 2-hour wait was ludicrous.This establishment is famous supposedly because Julia Child once said she likes to eat tacos here. I, like any well-seasoned foodie, solicit the opinions of old, white, American women when shopping for Mexican food.La Super-Rica Taqueria has a major problem. They need a simple policy that states that any given human ordering at the counter cannot order more than 10 menu items. That seems like a no-brainer to me at least. When I visited, a single person in front of me in line ordered 120 tacos for the entire Yale University Women's Basketball Team. I'm 100% serious here. After one poor soul, probably a freshman bench-warmer, waited for 2-hours in line for food, they put in this gigantic order, which was fulfilled in the form of cardboard boxes full of tacos. This led one such suburban mother of four to yell, ""I know it's the holiday season and all, but I hope you all lose."" Because of not instituting this 10-item limit policy, the line itself is not a good indicator of the wait time. For instance, if you are in line for The Hulk roller coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure and you are the next person in line for the ride, it would be mildly infuriating to see the entire Yale University Women's Basketball Team cut in front of you last second. The fact is that Yale weren't the only people cheating the system that day. Because the long line here is a known entity, only noobs would wait in line when a loser can do all the waiting on your behalf. Thus, everyone who is a local sends out a Super-Rica Taqueria ""courier,"" who is presumably the most insecure of the bunch. To put this in math terms, if you were to see the line out the door here is TTTTTLTTLT long where ""T"" is a tourist and ""L"" is a local, then to an outsider, the line is 10 persons long. Usually, that can be interpreted that 10 people have food orders in front of you. However, if each ""L"" local is a surrogate for a large basketball team, that line is secretly up to 8+33+33= 74 persons long. Thus is born the mystery of the super long wait at this restaurant. When only about 30 people are in line for food, it takes 2-hours to actually sit down and eat. This logistical failure led one patron to finally stand up and say, ""That's it! I'm driving back to L.A.!"" after waiting over 2-hours for his food that never came. Seriously, some unkind words were exchanged between ticket holder #47 and ticket holder #48. Okay, okay. So the wait is 2-hours long. Big deal. But obviously the food is worth it, right? Not in the slightest. Our group ordered a solid mix of tacos, quesadillas, and even specials from the menu. Only two things were outstanding: the chili relleno with cream and the ""rajas,"" which was a grilled pepper and melted cheese taco. Certainly delicious. But the Adobada pork and steak tacos were shockingly dull - overcooked, bland, rubbery. Sure, the tortillas themselves are made from scratch, but they can't make bad meat taste good. On the plus side, I met a fellow economist in line and we had ample time to peer-review a journal article draft for publication.",2 star rating,GT W.

5/29/2017,"Long Beach, CA","A great spot right off the freeway! I enjoyed all of our food there. The watermelon agua fresco was so good and very cheap. I enjoyed the large chunks of watermelon after. I also tried the horchata and AMAZING. It was not overpowered by cinnamon and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I was hoping that the tortillas would taste better because they were freshly made, but they were okay. The tacos are pretty small but perfect for the price. You'll need to get at least three if you're hungry. The best plate we got was the tri tip with onion and bell peppers. Our wait was only 10 minutes and worth it. I would go back again to try other dishes. The parking was a little tough but we found some street parking. It's cash only so remember to bring some!",4 star rating,Momo S.

10/17/2019,"Montecito, CA","Honestly La Super-Rica is mostly hype. It's still good and something to try if you're in town, but it's so touristy these days you can probably save time and have an even better meal if continue up Milpas to Buen Gusto!

4/10/2015,"Austin, TX","I love and miss this place. A Santa Barbara must have every time I'd come up here. Really authentic Mexican food. Wonderfully fresh corn tortillas that are literally pressed and grilled right in front of you. The line is worth the wait and the staff is always super nice.

2/27/2017,"Long Beach, CA","So much passion here! And it starts with a nice smile at the ordering window.A few months ago, I showed up to Super Rica to realize they still had 20 minutes to start. I met a Santa looking man named Don and he convinced me to order the plantain chicken tamal. 5 minutes later, we were told they were serving shredded beef tacos. Super Rica USUALLY doesn't serve anything shredded. The line was awesomely long by 11 and Don and I had priority. Don spared me $1.19, another man spared more than half of his guacamole, then Don shared the last bites of his tamal with me. Thankful at the very least. I LOVE this place. My plans now revolve around going here whenever I'm passing through.Will order again.. and again:- Obviously, extra handmade tortillas- Guacamole- Rajas!!!!!- Special Shredded beef tacos. So buttery delicious.- Mexican style, simple rice- Plantain chicken tamalEnjoy!",5 star rating,Tiffany B.
11/29/2016,"Culver City, CA","Are you hungry verging on hangry and is it about 1pm on a weekend? Probably best not to rely on La Super-Rica Taqueria. There will likely be a line out the door and it'll take you a while to finally get your food, at which point, you'll probably be in a horrible mood. This is a place to plan out, even arriving a bit before they open to avoid the wait. That's what I did and it's a big reason why I had an overall very good experience here. I knew this place was legendary and honestly, I think I was expecting a bit more flavor-wise and didn't realize that most things would come doused in melted cheese. Then again, how can you stay mad at a bunch of melted cheese?The best way to go is to share a bunch of dishes with a group. As you'll see in my photos, a group of four split I'd say close to 10 dishes and paid about $70 total. Very affordable in the grand scheme of things, but not dirt cheap for Mexican food. I can say for sure that it's all made fresh as you can see them preparing all of your dishes through the little windows in the kitchen. It all came out piping hot and served with a smile both by those in the kitchen and at the cash register though, so that counts for something in my book.The standout for me was the fresh corn tortillas, so expertly made. The surprising least favorite were the tacos de bistec - though they were piled high with steak, I found the meat to be dry. Nothing a dollop of guac or hot sauce can't help, though. Overall, it's a great little spot with lots of seating, friendly service, tons of options, and lots of melted cheese. Even if it's not the best Mexican you've ever had in your life, I'd say it at least partly lives up to the hype!",4 star rating,Christina P.

1/3/2015,"San Francisco, CA","An extremely long line is sometimes a good thing. I had heard about this place for a couple of years before we were able to make it here. On a recent trip to the central coast, we stopped by and I braved the line while my husband waited in the car with our sleeping child. The chile stuffed with cheese and marinated pork sounded pretty much like the best thing ever and, as it was a house specialty, we were all in. It was pretty good and we did enjoy it. A bit blander than I would have thought, but still, a tasty and unique item. I can't say it merited an hour long wait, but it was most certainly above average. Nice homemade tortillas too and a cute patio for those eating in.",4 star rating,Sharon G.
11/5/2018,Bay Area,"It's probably a little ridiculous to stand in line here for who knows how long. There are several good taquerias in Santa Barbara, including one just down on the other side of the street toward the freeway and another as you head the other direction. I went to these because the line at La Super-Rica was just too long!However, that said, I've had excellent food here. Everything I've had is very good, very satisfying. And it's a cute little place. I think you have to have cash only though. Check on that so you don't stand in line for a long time only to discover that little issue.I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. Last time I had #16, a roasted pasilla pepper stuffed with pork, I believe. Fantastic. I've had chile rellenos here and they're also especially good.

We had an option to go to another mexican 4.5 star restaurant close by with greater than 2000 reviews but we stuck to this place as we wanted to try the chilaquiles from their menu. And I swear by the old Gods and the new that you will not regret coming to this place, no matter what item from the menu you order. We waited for almost 1 hour in a huge line to eat here. But all that wait was worth it!!!This place is must try for anyone who wants to eat authentic mexican food. They have good vegetarian options as well. The watermelon juice is a must have.

6/21/2019,"Walnut, CA","This is a quaint little corner spot that can get really busy.  Don't be fooled by the entry area, there are more seats available behind the food order area.  The owner is professional, but warm to customers.  He gives the impression of both experience and efficiency.  Because of the initially narrow space where one orders and the way the menu is written, it can be stressful for a first timer (like me) to figure out what she wants while a large line waits behind her.  Although, I must mention the stress was really in my own mind, because I think everyone else seemed to know the routines of the place, and expected a wait.  Nonetheless, it was appreciated from a novice like me that Santa Barbrans were pretty laissez-faire about my slow and careful ordering.        I was unexpectedly fascinated with the open kitchen where I was able to observe the whole process of food to table.  Everyone was focused and serious, but seemed to do it all with ease and flow.   While waiting and watching, I overheard the conversation between the owner and a frequent customer (I assume).  It seems the owner is getting ready to retire and will be moving off to the midwest soon enough.   I am sure much of the community will be stopping by to offer well wishes and goodbyes.In regards to food, I did not think it was scintillating to my tastebuds.  However, my 4 stars go to the overall experience my family and I had there.  The staff was extremely cordial, and the atmosphere though very simply put together, was functional and reminds one of a family backyard bbq.  They have a self-serve salsa bar with everything frequently restocked.  Foods ordered:  Asada tacos were good, but not as memorable as the making of the dough and watching the freshly made corn tortillas on the griddle.Tri-tip with corn tortillas was okay.  Different salsas from the salsa bar enhanced the flavor.Chile relleno de queso con crema was not bad.  I had never encountered a chile relleno with cream sauce and was very eager to try.  The chile rellano itself was dense, and so the cream sauce made for an overly rich taste, in my opinion.  Adding salsa helped to cut the richness down.Sauteed strips of chile pasilla on tortilla with cheese was my ultimate favorite!  It was just a fantastic combination with the perfect flavors.  This is something that I would order again.In sum, the food was okay, but I really thought the food was fresh, and the friendly professional atmosphere is commendable.",4 star rating,Ais N.

2/22/2018,"Seattle, WA","I wanted to love this place... really! During my research on must-try places in SB, this came up as Julia Childs favorite on-record Mexican joint!  We arrived for lunch this afternoon, and after waiting in line for almost a solid 30min and then another 20min before our food started getting delivered, I was expecting greatness!It turned out greatness was lacking.  Hubby ordered the #7 ($5.80, Alambre de Filete: grilled tri-tip with bell pepper, onions, and bacon w/ 3 tortillas) & #8 ($5.80, Alambre de Pechuga: grilled chicken breast with bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms w/ 3 tortillas).  Chicken was dry to me, but to hubby more tender than the beef.  Beef to me was more flavorful, but quality of both meats was severely lacking!  My picks were much more successful, the #20 ($2.75, Gordita de Frijol: Handmade thick corn tortilla filled with spicy ground beans) & one of the specials ($???, Enchiladas de Plaza: Two corn tortillas filled with chicken breast, potato, mushroom, red chili sauce.  Topped w/ cheese, chile pasilla strips, cream sauce, avocado, & radish.  Two per order.)  Nothing was well seasoned, but I will say the green salsa at the help-yourself-bar went a long way towards the flavor department.All that with an order of 3 corn tortillas for $1 (for the little who needs chips, but they have none here) and $1.25 bottle of coke came to just under $30 with tax (before tip).Please note they only take cash, no credit/debit options here!Not worth the price, queue, or flavor.  Overrated Mexican place (maybe even the most overrated I've ever come across.)",2 star rating,Arti N.

I didn't even know about it being Julia Child's go-to.FOOD: Tacos de Bistec - steak tacos. They were clearly marinated and tasted amazing. It is quality meat that is cooked to perfection. The slices are quite large for a taco but that didn't distract from the taco itself. This was my least favorite of the bunch.Tacos de adobado - Pork tacos. These were absolutely amazing. The meat was very tender and the flavors were heavenly.Tacos de chorizo - hesitated to get these because I like my chorizo with breakfast, but this taco stole the show. This and the adobado was my top two.Lomito suizo - Pork w/ melted cheese. This was very delicious. As someone who really loves cheese and craves it all the time, it was a little much for me.- All tortillas are homemade and amazing.- green sauce is amazing, a lot more citrusy than other places!- pico de gallo is spicer than most taco places, but yummy! SERVICE: It is verrryyy slow. But I am not docking any stars or even mad about it. We got there around 5:30 on a Sat and were lucky to wait in line for 10 mins. After we ordered there was a line out the door with an average wait of 15-20 mins. This is obviously a small establishment and they do what they can.

Also, be ready to wait in line. I also do like that they have kind of a greenhouse kind of place to sit in. No plants, but's it's an outdoor venue that can be turned to an indoor venue.

Although it's hard for me to say that anything is the ""best I've ever eaten"" (how could I remember EVERY dish I've ever had?), now that I've tried this Mexican food, I have to say it's the best tasting Mexican I've ever had!!THE EXPERIENCE:The menu is written on a chalk board, you walk up to the counter to order, and remember to take CASH to pay!! After wine tasting along the Urban Trail, we visited La Super-Rica near closing time, around 8:30pm on a Saturday night. The line was very short, and food came relatively quickly at this time. You can see inside the big windows of the taqueria that everything is made FRESH for your order -- even the tortilla dough is pressed and cooked on the spot!!! THE FOOD: I'm a big fan of BEEF, so I ordered #1 (Tacos de Bistec), #7 (Alambre de Filete) and #19 (Frijol Super-Rica). My bf ordered #14 (Chorizo Especial) #16 (Super-Rica Especial) and something else I'm forgetting. Everything was AMAZING. For the next 10-15 minutes, we demolished every plate. My favorites were probably the #7 and #14 (the melted cheese was fabulous - NOT like the queso you typically get at Mexican restaurants!).

10/3/2016,"Ventura, CA","I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews before I found myself in the neighborhood and in need of food. And fortunately I showed up at 2:30 and the line was only a few people.I saw a positive review for the #6 rajas, so decided to give that a try along with the #1 bistec. I'm so glad I ordered that #6. I'll come back for that. I wasn't as impressed with the #1 but it was still good. The salsa verde was my favorite.The only disappointing part of the experience was having to contend with the flies in the dining area. It's understandable because it's a covered patio with openings where flies can make their way in. Perhaps next time I'll get it to go and find a local park.",4 star rating,Ben K.
8/6/2016,"Redwood City, CA",Jumping on the 5 star Rica bandwagon. This place is unique.  It is one of the only places I know that it is worth waiting in line for as long as it takes (the other if you must know is in Paris -- Le Relais de Venise). Unique Mexican.  These are not your average tacos but traditional creations-- with a sometimes modern flair.  You can't go wrong.  Sometimes they have soup.  That is also delicious.  Come with a crowd and share a ton of dishes.  The flavors are great.  Casual atmosphere.  Goos pricing. Always a line.,5 star rating,Katharine A.
3/22/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","The days of this being the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara are long gone. The only reason there is a line out the door is the extremely slow service. In addition to the lack of respect for their customers they charge an excessive amount of tax above what's the state requires. You'll see bare seating arrangements with open tables but a line outside. Their salsas seem weird with added garlic and other random ingredients meant to add complexity to them but falls short. You've got Rosales and other restaurants making better food. Other than the fame and name Julia child's gave this in the past is done. Not worth the wait, being overcharged and subpar food.",2 star rating,Chris G.
7/15/2019,"Lower State, Santa Barbara, CA",Alright so my review may be a little bit biased because I have had tacos from many better places and even lived in Mexico. But at La Super-rica I don't find anything special about there tacos they are a little bit on the small sized and in my opinion a bit overpriced. There tends to be a long line every time I go and I don't see why they take about an average of 10 min to get your food after ordering no matter what you get. Some claim that this place has the best tacos in town but honestly nothing shined through for me the salsa was average the meat was grisly and it wasn't worth the price. If I had to pick the best tacos in town I would have to go with Lilly's tacos.,2 star rating,Jacob P.

This is awesome.Secondly, the tacos are amazing. The portion size is decent and the homemade tortillas are soo soo good.There's a lot of hype and the never-ending line outside the door demonstrates it.

1/22/2018,"Ventura, CA","This might be my favorite restaurant in the world. You can't beat it for the price point. The fresh-made tortillas are amazing. The #16 is always good: marinated pork, peppers, and cheese. The chorizo quesadillas are fantastic. Some of the best meals though are on the Specials menu. On Mondays they have great chilaquiles. Not sure which days these are, but the fish tamales, veggie tamales, and veggie chile rellenos are incredible. It's not a standard taqueria: no chips, no burritos. It's cash only and closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. If it's peak hours on a weekend be prepared for a wait. But weekdays before 5:00 or after 8:15 or so it's usually not bad at all. And to all the people who say the food is not flavorful, I'm guessing you ordered the plain steak taco, what did you expect? There are tons of super flavorful choices. And again, the real gems are in the daily specials menu. I'd give it more stars if I could.",5 star rating,Alex M.
10/13/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA",The food isn't bad I guess.  The food is NOT worth the line and also the reputation from Julia Child is outdated.  There are plenty of other great traditional taquerias here in town that have better food than this place.  I've been there a couple times and the line is never worth it.  This is a place that people like to like because of one famous review.,1 star rating,Justin M.
5/31/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","First off, this place gets super crowded on weekends so do not come starving....you will probably have to wait at least 30 min. That being said the food is great and cheap!We ordered the chiliquiles, chorizo quesadilla, vegetable tamale and #16 which is their special. #16 was delicious it was pork mixed with chilis and cheese. I also loved the tamale (it tasted like vegetable lasagna) and was unlike any other Mexican food I have had before. The other 2 dishes were both really good as well but not my favorites. I also ordered a glass of horchata which was delicious, they serve a watermelon drink too which looks good and I wish I would have tried it. (Everything in total was only $30)My favorite tacos in SB are Lilly's, I didn't try any here so i can't compare but I didnt order them because they didn't look that good in the reviews. Anyways their other food is great and if you are looking to try some new dishes you may not have had before definetly give this place a try!",4 star rating,Meghan M.

But if I lived there I'd take out-of-towners for the rough-and-tumble experience. I respect the fact they make their own tortillas, but you'd better know what you'd want before taking a crack at ordering. The guacamole was good, but they don't have chips. A lot can be forgiven.

5/31/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","I'm not quite understanding the hype?As expected the line was  long outside the door. Waiting in line for a while, I thought the food would be very tasty and filling.  We ordered the #16, tacos, quesadilla, horchata, and agua frescas.I was quite disappointed. It's nothing special in comparison to all the other Mexican food places throughout Los Angeles and even in San Diego. The meat in the tacos were dry and not as flavorful as I had hoped. The horchata was too overpowered with cinnamon. The #16 was pretty good and the chorizo in the quesadilla had good chunks in it. Usually chorizo is served grounded so I like that it was kept in slices.What really turned me off from this place was the fact that this family of four rolls up in their honda with tinted windows. They don't even wait in line for their food. The guy walks straight up to the window where they call out their food and orders there. I couldn't quite understand what the guy and the worker were saying to each other because they were talking in Spanish. As you can assume, that family of four that skipped the line got their food on the next called out order afterwards. I think that's pretty unfair that the the guy just walks up to the window and gets all his food for his family right away while many people are still waiting for theirs. I'm not happy with that service. Pretty unfair. CASH ONLY. There's street parking, and they have a small lot. It fits maybe like 3-5 cars.",2 star rating,Joyce D.
11/5/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","We were excited to visit this taqueria where Julia Childs ate and Katy Perry sang about. It wasn't horribly bad but it definitely wasn't good. And it's definitely not worth the wait. There's much better Mexican food, with better homemade corn tortillas, just a block away from this place. Here's what we ordered:1. #1 tacos de bistec - Steak was super dry, no seasoning, and bland. It's literally pieces of over-cooked steak and 2 corn tortillas on a plate. There's no onions or cilantro on the tacos or at the salsa bar. 2. #6 rajas - Took one bite and threw out the rest. It was slimey! So gross. 3. #8 alambre de pechuga - Dry and bland pieces of chicken sautéed with onions, mushroom, and pepper thrown on top of 3 corn tortillas. We didn't even see the tortillas until we used a fork to shift the food around on the plate. You have to assemble the tacos yourself. 4. #12 pechuga suizo - It's basically a quesadilla on corn tortilla. Melted cheese, a thin slice of dry chicken in between 2 corn tortillas. Nothing special. 5. agua fresca de sandia - decent but nothing special. There's a salsa bar with green sauce, red sauce, and pico de gallo. No onion, cilantro, lemon, radish. Maybe this place is good for Santa Barbara standards. Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the delicious tacos served in LA. I'm never ever going back here.",2 star rating,Cynthia C.

3/31/2014,"Chicago, IL","To be honest, I had some mixed feelings about this place. I think it was really good. Like I'm pretty sure. But I think it wasn't quite my style of Mexican food. (I've probably eaten too much ""white washed"" Mexican food)Anyways, I'll try to explain further. I got #16 since it seemed to be popular and on man vs food. Normally I would go for a carne asada meat, but was willing to try something new. I wasn't terribly a big fan of the pork itself and I thought the chilli pasillo would have more flavor. But at the same time it tasted really authentic to me. So that's why I gave it 4 stars. The tortillas were really good. Guacamole was too. Oh and the watermelon agua fresca! So refreshing. Oh oh and the salsa verde! I'm not sure what the flavor was, like maybe? But it was so different and I loved it. It's definitely a janky hole in the wall type place and I really appreciate those kinds of places. Unfortunately I'm not from the SB area so who knows if I'll ever be back. But I really hope to because I'm positive I would find something amazing there. Also, of course, long line, not too much seating and cash only!",4 star rating,Kelly G.

Today there was essentially no line so we figured we'd give it a try. We ordered some very basic tacos and we figured it would be very quick but we were wrong. The tacos ended up taking about 40 minutes to make. So after waiting an absurdly long for the tacos to come out the plate they gave me just had a tortilla with some meat spread around looking as though it would have taken no more than 30 seconds to make.

4/30/2016,"Danville, CA","La Super Rica is a famous Mexican place in Santa Barbara raved by Julia Child and Katy Perry. Lines can be extremely long, usually out the door (although only about three people can fit between the door and cashier anyways). We went on a Monday and we only had to wait behind 2-3 people. Location is slightly far away from downtown state street, about a 3-5 minute drive.FYI MAJOR PART: they don't take cards. You have to pay in cash. We didn't learn this until we got there, but luckily we had enough cash on us to cover it!We got #1,#3,#4,#5,#7, and #12. #1 was really good, but not the best steak taco I've ever had. The chorizo taco was actually the best one as the meat was extremely flavorful and cooked quite well! Both #3 and #4 were similar in taste although one of the meats was drier than the other. #12 the cheese quesadilla with chicken was quite basic and I wouldn't get it again because you can do it at home and add more inside the quesadilla. The #7 tritip was really good although it needs more than 3 tacos in my opinion, more like 6 (but we asked for 3 more before cause we didn't realize the tacos were underneath the meat. All that food for about $25!Now I'm a Lilly's girl. I love their tacos, they're cheaper than La Super Rica and their meats are SOOOO much tastier! I will say La Super Rica wins on salsa for sure, Lilly's doesn't even compare in the salsa department. We even took some home. So I'd say go get Lilly's tacos, but eat them with La Super Rica's salsa! There's a good amount of seating behind the kitchen area. They don't have a permanent roof and we went on a windy day and I could see it shaking, so maybe don't come on a rainy day.Overall: 3.5 stars.

This food is Yucatán, so don't expect a side of rice & beans with your dish. My favorites are the vegetarian tamale and their mushroom tacos (these tacos are Saturday's only ). Both of these dishes come topped with a cream sauce that I want more of! As a long time regular I will share a secret, don't go at peak times! If you must then expect to wait a long time. Isadoro is the owner and takes the orders at the window. He will talk to you if you want to talk to him, he's not trying to hurry customers through, which is part of the reason for the long line. So if you're in a hurry go around 2 or 3 pm and you will get out sooner. Super tasty food!",5 star rating,Karel Z.
9/3/2017,"Orange County, CA","I don't get it, i really don't. The food was very bland, overpriced and small portions. The guy at counter ""warned"" me about the Gordita being really spicy, i'm pretty terrible when it comes to handling spicy food so i was prepared to struggle with it. 1 bite, nothing, 2 bite, nothing, 3rd bite, nothing spicy was being tasted. I've been to so many other places where they tell me an item isn't spicy, yet was spicier. The Carne asada tacos tasted like they got the meat and just threw it on the grill, no seasoning, no, soaking it, nothing. The posole was about the only decent tasting thing here. I want it to be clear that i'm voicing my opinion on the food taste. The service was decent, the quality of the food was good, but the taste was lacking across the whole menu to me. Especially for the price and portion sizes. But i may be a minority in my opinion considering there was a half hour line i stood in and it only seemed to grow. Maybe its because im from SoCal so im used to more authentic stuff.

8/6/2017,"Kansas City, MO","Your meal at La Super-Rica might be your favorite meal in Santa Barbara!  This authentic taqueria boasts superlative, handmade corn tortillas and reasonable prices (assuming you can resist ordering the whole menu), and a wonderful meal in total!  Don't get scared off by the long queue along the street.  It does not move too quickly, but the food is well worth the wait.  La Super-Rico is well known as a favorite Santa Barbara restaurant of the late chef Julia Child and of Wolfgang Puck, and once you eat the food you will see why!   I greatly enjoyed my Taco de Bistecca (#1), Guacamole served with two corn tortillas (#18), and the special Tamales de Verduras.  My tacos came with two small corn tortillas and beef.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I added their pico de gallo and tomatillo salsa (along with some of the delicious guacamole) and my tacos were heaven on a plate!  They were so good that I neglected to offer a bite to my kids!  (Don't feel bad; the children were happily eating quesadillas and guacamole.)  The tamales are not to be missed.  I was initially hesitant at the idea of a vegetarian tamale, but I am so glad that I ordered this treat!  It featured chayote and avocado and roasted zucchini and other vegetables, all with a cream sauce on top, and it was both flavorful and comforting in all the best ways!  As for the guacamole, eating it with the delicious, fluffy corn tortillas was different than eating guacamole with chips as I usually prefer (and I admit I miss the saltiness of a crispy tortilla chip), but the guacamole was good as it was and was also an excellent garnish to add to my tacos (so definitely worth ordering).  This amount of food (plus a $2 bottle of particularly good lemonade) was about perfect.  I left full and satisfied and VERY pleased with my meal.  If you are in Santa Barbara, do not miss the chance to visit La Super-Rica Taqueria.  Expect a wait in line (even at 2pm for lunch; even at 3pm for lunch!) but come hungry and ready for a truly excellent meal.",5 star rating,Julia F.

8/24/2016,"Concord, CA","Yes we went here twice in two days... and we'd do it again! Honestly, what can I say that hasn't already been said about this place? We've been coming here off and on (when we're in town) for years and the food is always delicious. Last time I was there I had the Alambre de filete and my husband had the Super Rica especial, so good! We each had a vegetable tamale. I absolutely adore the vegetable tamales!The only thing I can add is to avoid the long lines and crowds is to get here on a weekday between the lunch and dinner hours. It's usually very quiet and there's not much of a wait.  Just keep an eye on their hours and make sure they're not closed.  And of course bring cash because they don't take cards.",5 star rating,Kaylee F.

5/29/2016,"Madera, CA",OMG.  that about sums it up.I ordered la super especial.  They basically took two of my favorite mexican foods and put them into one dish on top of fresh corn tortillas.  Carne adobada with grilled chiles pasillas and cheese.  And they serve cafe de olla.  Tastebud heaven.,5 star rating,Alma B.
7/10/2015,"Chicago, IL","The single best reason to hit Super-Rica is to get those fresh tortillas.  And I mean FRESH.  As you're ordering, you can see the woman making them by hand right behind the cashier.  They taste incredible.Unfortunately, there are a lot of negatives surrounding the experience.  You wait in a long line with one cashier.  Seating is incredibly limited and no one really cleans the tables.  Because it's so busy, your food takes a long, long time to come out.I had the #4 - tacos de adobado (pork) and the #1 - tacos de bistec (steak) tacos.  Both were pretty good, but not much food for the price.  I enjoyed the pork more.If you show up and there's just a small line, you'll probably walk away very happy.  But if you see people in line, hunker down for a long wait.Yes, it's good.  Yes, the tortillas are amazing.  But there are some significant drawbacks.Hey, Super-Rica: Maybe expand the kitchen and add at least one more cashier station.  Or maybe I'll shut up because you have a line out the door and you know what you're doing.Warning: Cash only!Bonus: Julia Child liked this spot.  Seriously: experience.usatoday.com/…",3 star rating,Ben B.

11/16/2013,"Thousand Oaks, CA","One of my favorite eats anywhere. I don't come to Santa Barbara without stopping here (usually more than once if it's a multi-day trip).The menu is deceptively simple: hand-written in chalk on a black board. Things like chicken and cheese between two tortillas. And that's really all it is. No fancy garnishes, no extra ingredients. But somehow, the whole is always greater than the sum of the parts at La Super-Rica.Some tips for first-timers:-Bring cash.-Never ignore the specials board. -If in doubt, order it.-Go with people who like to share. You'll want to try everything.The best day for Superica is Saturday, when they have the taco de hongo, one of the very most delicious things in the world. Sautéed mushrooms in some ridiculous cream sauce on their house-made corn tortillas. Sweet mother of mercy.I'm unclear on what type of Mexican food this is. It's like French-Mexican fusion, with all the cream sauces going on. Whatever it is, I wish it existed everywhere.Other favorites: the rajas (bell peppers and onions and chiles sautéed into delicious oblivion on a tortilla) and veggie chile relleno (again with the cream sauce). If you're into meat, the chorizo and cheese on a tortilla is pretty tasty.The guacamole is solid, as is the selection of salsa/hot sauce. They only accept cash, there's always a line, and it's always worth it. In fact, the wait makes it that much more delicious.",5 star rating,Dara M.
5/1/2019,"Simi Valley, CA","Don't sweat the line. The food is worth the wait and the wait is never that bad. It is within walking distance of the Santa Barbara Bowl.

5/22/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA",Julia Child Died NINE years ago!   And she commented on La Super-Rica a dozen years before that!    Please!!  400 Santa Barbara Restaurants have come and gone since she made that place famous.   I do believe that if she were alive today she would enjoy Los Agaves a little bit more.That said; I had a very nice lunch there yesterday.    It was the Super-Rica Special.   A nice Chile Con Queso with pork and several of their delicious hand made tortillas.   Yum!   Just the right amount of spice.   I don't think that the food is so good that it is worth the 45 minute wait that you often have to endure.    I go a little bit later so that I don't have to wait.While the food is delicious I would think that some attention could be paid to the cleanliness of the eating area.    I would say that it is about as clean as the average beach park.    Looks like it gets hosed down at least once a week.,4 star rating,Douglas M.

Pretty sweet, and has chunks of watermelon in it which I wasn't expecting.",5 star rating,Jessica W.
4/19/2017,"Glendale, CA","A number of years ago none other than Julia Child called La Super Rica her favorite place to eat. Almost immediately with that as the ultimate endorsement ringing in our ears, my sister and i figured we had to check out  this food.And Miss Julia was right: the Beef ( i always have problems with the beef at Taquerias) was moist and most importantly was not cut up like kibble something i particularly dislike.No the beef was moist and cut in strips. we were impressed. In the intervening years i have been to La Super many times with varying results of success and failure all across the menu board.These ups and downs are a natural thing when you frequent a place for over 20 years.Obviously all of the ""misses"" were nothing that could keep me away because the 'hits"" far outnumbered them.Last week i hit the 101 on a Trader Joe's run (i like the Milpas store the best) and thought to myself: ""hey let's check out the special tamale i have been hearing about at La Super!"" And so i did.The Tamal of the day was Plantain Chicken. the flavor of the plantain leaves (the wrap) permeated the masa. chicken and other bits of filling in a way that was slightly sweet yet  full of savory goodness: surprisingly plantains and chicken meld perfectly. You cannot produce this flavor dispersion from wrap to filling when a dried corn husk is used. i could have had another 1 or 2.I also ordered a couple tacos: Adobado and of course, Bistek. Several cultures have Adobado, the Philippine for one and yet i prefer the Mexican variety made here because of the red chili used in the mix: i think the New Mexico variety which is full of flavor and heat.The Bistek was as i remembered it: sliced, moist, tasting slightly of char and when adorned with guacamole and salsa and cut onions is pretty terrific.Wash all that down with a super cold Bohemia and i am in La Super Rica heaven.I have to be honest : this is not always the case here but somehow La Super always pulls it out the next time i come in.This was a well spent early afternoon in East SB. Yes, it was.",4 star rating,Michael A.

7/27/2018,"San Francisco, CA","....my place!!!' Like Denzel says "" My Man"", I say... ""My Place""!!!  The line outside was inching longer as we arrived.  I was told this was a good place, and by the look of the line, that was proving out...I was more than curious because there was a mixture of locals and tourist standing and waiting...the minute we got to an angle where I could see the menu, I peaked and listened as my fellow patrons ordered... lots of menu choices, but the biggest thing was the price.  $2.50, $6.99, etc...SWEET! now only were the prices great, but I could now ""test"", ""taste"", and maybe even ""waste"" (if I got to full testing, and tasting)...sooooo, I did!  I order the taco's ( Chorizo), I ordered the ""#16 because I heard others say it was good), along with a soda ( im a healthy dude, but slip into the soda thing every once-and-a-while).     Look!!!! this food was off the charts good!  The couple that sat in front of us, to the group of six at an angle from us, were all raving over the taste!  Matter-of-fact, the couple turned and looked over at me as they were leaving, and asked - did you order the #16? ...after I commented ""yes"" with joy, they said "" It was amazing!!! right""...I responded - ""absolutely""!  ......Look! this is a joint that brings it ( adding a little word salad/flavor/slang)!  The food is amazing!  They put their foot in it!!!! ( more slang flavor!). Bottom-line - Amazing!  I don't normally give 5""s, but I'm going to change this 4 to a 5 right now!  Not only was it affordable, but the food was amazing!  Most restaurants that I've eaten at could take a lesson or two from this team!  Value Value Value...keep it simple, and be the best!  ...and put your foot in it!   I recommended !!!!!!!!",5 star rating,Ron B.
3/13/2016,"San Gabriel, CA","5 star for taste. Unlimited Fresh kitchen made salsa The tortillas are made fresh on the spot. I dont think I ever seen it like that and I am from Los Angeles You see a girl pressing and throwing them right onto the grill. I think it's the best tasting tacos I ever had and being in Los Angeles area for 25+ years, it's tough to beat.  The aftermath of the delicious meal didnt left me feeling queasy and bloated or gasy. It digested well. 2 days prior, I had a wet burrito in Los Angeles and I felt I was growing a double chin afterwards. I felt so greasy and kept burping.I have to count on yelp reviewers to give me photo of the actual food item.  I wish they have photos or something. Or at least something to look at while waiting in lineSpecialty items like tameles and enchiladas do not have a price so better ask before you order. Pretty sure it is wasnt 2 dollars.   My fault for not asking so for a meal enough for 4 people I spent 50 dollars.  I didnt want to hold up the huge long line behind me. Hochata was ok, hibiscus was ok.  If you are there first time and on a trip to Santa Barbara, order one of each. Don't forget to try Tameles an enchiladas.  Actually enchiladas were ok.The zucchini and pork was the best I think. Quesadilla was ok. There was only 1 cashier and I think that's how they operate so that's probably the main reason for the long line. It is a must eat.   It is like in&out of Mexican food.1 star down for long wait, no photo menu, no price on tameles and enchiladas.Btw I didnt get a receipt so I was nervous if they left out something. Maybe I should of asked.I am convinced what makes it taste good is fresh made tortillas. It makes a whole lot difference",4 star rating,Hunter L.

1/31/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","Came here on a Saturday night and tried the Super Rica Especial #16 which was delicious  . The marinated pork combined with melted cheese and grilled peppers was enough to fill me up. On top of that, they make their own tortillas!

5/30/2015,"El Monte, CA","So we can up to Santa Barbara to run an errand, and since there's nothing else to do there.... We decided to eat. Seafood was out of the question because of the oil spill from the past week, so we decided to eat Mexican (figured it was the easiest thing and you can't mess up on Mexican food.....WRONG!) we found this place on Yelp and it had over 800 reviews with 4 stars.... Looks legit, right? WRONG again! Those stars would only apply to people that have never tried Mexican food before or have no taste buds. First off, the parking was horrible. Adjacent street is not SUV friendly and there's a long line, idk why... Cause the food SUCKS. We ordered two items off the ""specials""-the vegetable tamale and the green chili, asada quesadilla, and horchata. Everything came out to be $21(way too expensive for Mexican food)Vegetable tamale: worst tamale ever had. Very underwhelming and over rated. Definitely does not live up to the hype of the reviews Green chili: very bland and tiny AF. In any other Mexican restaurant, these plates come with rice and beans, this did not. As pictured, it looked like a sad green chili in a box. The chili had no natural flavor to it. They didn't grill it right. Lastly, the wait does not justify how horrible their food is. On one good note, my daughter did enjoy her asada quesadilla, however if they failed to succeed at making a quesadilla, they really should reconsider changing their cuisine. Take it from a Mexican food lover, avoid this place, just go eat seafood, and if that's unavailable, just go home.",1 star rating,Joyce H.

The food is all incredibly fresh and made directly in front of you behind the ordering window.   The tortillas are being made from scratch as necessary - which is essentially nonstop.  We ordered the Tacos de Adobado (marinated pork), Tacos de Chorizo, Quesadilla con Chorizo and the Frijole Super-Rica (pinto beans with chorizo, bacon and Chile).    It was all delicious. There is no parking so you end up trying to find a place along one of the side streets.  It's all good.Again, the food was great - very fresh - and very basic ---  would definitely come back again!",4 star rating,Marc L.

For those who thinks it is bland or dry, you need add salsa to your taste, so much better than those over sauced over calculated designer tacos.  I can't wait to go back. The wait is long though, about 30 minutes mainly because they need to cook to order. Love love love. They serve coke in a bottle and offer your ice for drinks.  My only regret is I didn't order enough tacos.  The special is very nice but make sure to get extra tortillas (like guacamole which comes with two tortillas).",5 star rating,Wendy Z.

5/28/2018,"Modesto, CA","We initially tried to go to another very well rated restaurant down the block but after a day of fishing at the Goleta pier we figured this spot would be best suited.  I had also seen the reviews and the Júlia child story plus the very long line outside convinced us to go in.  The hand made tortillas were really nice but have to admit all the build up about their tacos was too much because they were good but not mind blowing.  I had better tacos in the Bay Area and other places.  The Chile relleno was one of the most interesting and delicious that I've had in a restaurant.  Also, asked for some fresh jalapeños and the guy passing out orders turn to what I assume is the owner to see if he could give me some and then I was told that they did not have any, really?? I would have paid for them if you were so worried about that but that's like telling me there is no sand at the beach!!!!  Not impressed and we tried just about one of everything but again was expecting amazing tacos and hey were good but not what I expected.",3 star rating,John A.

Definitely also recommend grabbing an horchata drink if you're thirsty. (Never had horchata? Perfect time to try it. It's a rice milk drink.

10/3/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","First, I must say, Super Rica lives up to all of the hype. This family-run Mexican eatery serves up real quality food. The recommended Rajas, is a vegetarian dish that is so delicious and satisfying. Green chiles are grilled with onions, smothered with cheese and served over a pillowy corn tortilla. It sounds all too simple & plain, however, it has proven to be the contrary. A dish that cannot be missed is Super Rica's Pozole. It is hands-down THE BEST Pozole. The broth is thick and robust! All of the spices, citrusy lime juice, tender meat, hominy, and fresh shredded cabbage mixed together is perfection. Seriously, no other place could even compare. Chorizo fun dido is a caloric splurge but oh-so-worth-it. Who could resist melted cheese, chorizo and fluffy hand-made tortillas?! Pretty much anything on their menu board is going to be delicious. I'm so happy to eat here at least once a month. And waiting in line for about 15-minutes is absolutely normal and worth all the trouble.",5 star rating,Lucy H.

What a MISTAKE!  The line was long because the order taking is archaic and slow slow slow. Cash only. So we ordered FINALLY and we thought our food would soon be out. WRONG. We waited and waited and after 30 more minutes we got the orders. We opted for take out since it was too hot in the dirty dining room. When we got home to eat - the food was at most just mediocre.

3/23/2015,"Seal Beach, CA","I stumbled across this gem of a place on Yelp while my hubby and I were driving through Santa Barbara last Summer. When we arrived, we noticed a line out the door that wrapped around the side of the building....and knew we had struck gold :-) It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that fool you. The food is ridiculously good. Like so good that I am dreaming about our next trip in July....(cue the Homer Simpson drool sound effect.)  They have a year round menu that is on a huge board as you enter, but pay attention because they also have a small board by the order window that has weekly specials. Both visits, I have ordered off their weekly specials. If they have the chilaquiles, YOU MUST TRY. Homemade chips smothered in red sauce, topped with an onion, bell pepper, guacamole and Mexican cheese. I have also had the Veggie Tamal which is outstanding and I highly recommend. Oh, and their homemade tortillas are so good. The fresh watermelon drink is refreshing, but it does have more of an ""earthy"" flavor to it. I prefer an ice cold bottle of Coke with this meal :-)Keep in mind that the kitchen does not use heavy salt in their dishes, which I appreciate. You can really enjoy the flavors in each bite without salt overload. Enjoy!! If the wait is long, be patient. It's totally worth it!",5 star rating,Erica F.

We didn't order a ton since we had recently eaten and it's probably a good thing because nothing was really stand out amazing in any way.We shared a #1 Taco, a cheese quesadilla and guacamole.

8/12/2016,"Vancouver, Canada","You know how you can eat a single dish that haunts you for years -- a dish that makes you desperate to hop on airplanes and cross borders, just to eat it again?The taco with charred peppers and melted cheese will live in my memory as one of those dishes. My husband didn't even like it, thank goodness -- more for me! But I loved the roasted, gooey, slightly spicy deliciousness. I am crying a little at the thought I can't have it right now.The rest of our meal was tasty, too, if not as memorable. The fresh tortilla chips, while they may not sound as sexy as the tacos, really *are* worth experiencing; freshly made and freshly cooked, they are delicious and crunchy in a way that makes every other tortilla chip I've ever eaten want to hide its tiny triangular face in shame.My husband, who I swear is actually a lovely person with decent taste in food, actually enjoyed Los Agaves (down the street) more than our meal at La Super-Rica. But honestly, if we found ourselves back in Santa Barbara again, with enough time for only a single romantic meal, I'd let him eat at Los Agaves by himself just so that I could come back to Super-Rica for four more of those chile-and-cheese tacos. Yes, I'd be stuffed at two, and my husband would be mildly insulted. But a girl's got to have her charred peppers and cheese.",4 star rating,Alexandra S.

For that matter check and make sure they are open before you drive over.I come here frequently when in town. About the only place I will order a taco that comes without meat (sautéed pasilla pepper).Everything is good and fairly cheap. I would recommend trying everything but I do get those tacos as a bumper every time.

Really disappointed.",1 star rating,Sammie B.
8/4/2016,"Hawthorne, CA","We had to stop by on the way to Solvang.  My girl hear this place was good, and people aren't kidding.  It's no surprise why there's always a waiting line apparently.  At first glance it looks quite small, but there's plenty of room inside, if you can make it.  Make sure you check out the menu and photos before you check this place out because selection is key.  Many things are good, but others are beyond.  It's not really about hit or miss, but why not go for the good stuff to begin with?  The great thing is that they make their tortillas by hand right next to the grill.  That's a huge plus.  That's not necessarily a taste everyone is into, but it adds charm.  I'm a fan of the hand made tortilla, so points for that.  Some people don't like them because they can be dense and heavier than tortillas typically used by most taco joints.  The #16  Super-Rica especial is delicious for that reason.  The tortilla thickness can take away a lot of the flavor for some people, but if you're into the corn taste, or you tried tacos in Mexico, it won't bug you.  Because the #16 has several flavors and cheese going on, you don't lose the taste in the tortilla.  I mean you could add sauce, but you don't want to add so much sauce that it then becomes the major flavor profile.  Additionally, I tried the #1 Tacos de bistec, the #2 Tacos de costilla, the #3 Tacos de chuleta, and the #4 Tacos de adobado.  Frankly,  the difference in flavor between the #2 & #3 was not that different.  I think the meat may have been a bit overcooked because they were pretty dry, and with the thickness of the tortilla, they were a bit hard to swallow.  They are generous with the meat serving, but they tasted too similar to say one is better than the other.  The #1 meat was good.  It totally reminded me of meat in Mexico, but again the flavor was nothing out of this world.  My favorite was the #4.  I really think it's the flavor added to the meat.  These tacos are good, but they have more potential.  I'm not saying I'm not a fan, but it wasn't the best taco I had in Santa Barbara.  I know there are a lot of hard core fans out there, but I'm trying to keep it very real.  I would definitely recommend this place and I can see why so many people like it.  However, to get a better experience, I recommend getting something that incorporates several ingredient and flavor profiles.    To be honest, one of my favorite things was the people.  The entire feel of the place was local.  The people behind the grill give you a feeling that you're in Baja.  The visitors make it happen though.  I think everyone is looking forward to just having a decent taco, and whether it's locals or passer-byes like me, it's a good place.  Be prepared to bring cash, cause they don't take any cards or apple pay.  The price is a little steeper than I thought, but not bad.  It's really because of the quality of ingredients, so worth it.  Parking is not easy though, and definitely prepare for a wait.  You don't have to eat here always, but definitely check it out.  It has a charm to it that I can't really articulate.  Awesome job to this place.  I would definitely tell my peeps to take a look.",4 star rating,Carlos T.
9/7/2014,"Corvallis, OR","La Super-Rica is tasty and definitely not your typical chicken quesadilla Mexican place.I tried to forget about a certain famous chef who gave this place her stamp of approval and just review it without any bias. We got there at 3 pm on a Sunday and the line was about 15 people deep. Finding seating for 13 people in our group was difficult but not impossible. We got the #17 (it's basically the #16 without pork) and also the tamal de verduras off the special menu, which is basically tamales (singular) filled with veggies and topped with creamy cheese sauce. Both were awesome. The portions are small in my opinion--we were just having a snack so we shared these two things, but this would have been a normal lunch for just me. These two items plus jamaica and a coke cost $15. NOTES: They only take cash, it's street parking and the seating is in what I would best describe as an enclosed outdoor area. So, it gets a bit warm with the kitchen nearby and flies have figured out that they like this place too.",3 star rating,Chelsea B.

9/2/2017,"San Pedro, CA","Simple, verging on really good home cooking in flavor and style. But good!!!! So good!! For what they do it's fantastic and the vibe is also really pleasant. I don't think I've ever been happier with a carnitas quesadilla. Just carnitas, queso, and excellent homemade tortillas. Love. On a different visit I tried the veggie tamale (on the specials). Had plenty of fresh squash and other fresh veggies, not over cooked! Very good and I loved the unique cream sauce on the tamale, I prefer not too much masa, and I don't like a dry tamale... so I like their sauce w/  adding some salsa, super fresh. Yes, overall they could be more flavorful and they tend to cook the meats pretty well...but never over done.  They're not heavy handed on marinating meats: my hubby would like that since marinates tend to bother him. For some people it's a make or break issue. So how they deal with their meats: simply. More like a preference thing. But this is not nouveau cooking. This is old school but not your typical 'Mexican restaurant' style either. So for that alone it's worth it. Both times I visited the line was pretty short maybe 5 people or less in front of us. My whole life I've visited SB, seen the crazy Line at this place and never got to try it. We lucked out and just went at non-rush times. It was a fun place for a late dinner, very casual hang with friends. And a great place for a 4pm stop and get some perfect carnitas quesadillas before heading back to LA. Guacamole was really yum. Frescas are SWEET, but I enjoyed it.  Liked the horchata, jicama was too sweet for me. I wish they had a little (to a lot) of real outdoor seating... the view just from the sidewalk towards the mountains w/ the palms, is really relaxing. That's about all I'd really change: have some outdoor, open sky seating.  And maybe have the veggie tamales every day (so I could always get them no matter what day of the week!) oh and if you like Mexican cheese...melted Mexican cheeses: this is your dream come true. They are not shy about how much cheese: if they say they're giving you cheese in the dish, be prepared....for a generous helping.  I heart La Super Rica.",5 star rating,Catherine T.
8/28/2016,"Los Angeles, CA",No place makes tortillas like they do here because they have tortilla making down to a science and art because to make them this thin and fluffy it is difficult and must be done very carefully. Everything here is done by hand with no machines which takes tremendous labor. I drive all the way from the valley just to get tacos and drive home and it's worth it. When they have Chilesquiles you can order chips and guacamole but most people don't know that. The orchata is second to none and I haven't had anything remotely close. I believe Julia Child's liked this place because of the extra care put into everything in the philosophy of keeping it simple and using the best and freshest ingredients.There are three places to park on-premises if you're lucky. The close on Tuesday and Wednesday so don't do what I did a couple times. Probably my favorite thing there is the red and green salsa. The taco de rajas is the best and the rice. There is a bowl of cheese with bacon in it. Need I say more?,5 star rating,Dave L.

Cashier I encountered was very kind- saw him patiently answering people's questions while waiting for food. I got 2 steak tacos and they load up their tacos with meat! Big pieces of tender steak, not little chopped up little pieces with hard tendon and tough meat. Their tortillas are HANDMADE, which probably contributes to the wait time for food.

We had no idea what the place looked like, but when we saw a little restaurant on the corner with a line wrapped around the building, we figured this was it... and it was! Quick Tip: Cash only!The food: VERY GOOD! I ordered the Tacos De Costilla (grilled strips of top round served on two homemade tortillas). The price was $2.50 each. I thoroughly enjoyed the tacos!!My wife ordered the Chilaquiles (homemade tortilla chips, covered in special sauce topped with cheese, grilled onion, bell peppers, guacamole, and Mexican cheese crumbled over the top).

9/22/2014,"Seattle, WA","For $2.50+, the tacos are priced like other places in Santa Barbara (but still twice the price of Los Angeles). That said, this place does serve up a good amount of meat on each taco that is probably about equivalent to two $1 tacos in LA, to which you can add some of their pico de gallo (5 stars) or red or green salsa (which I'm not a big fan of, but found interesting, 3 stars). So, why only two stars? Well, the food is served cold--you wait for a good deal of time for your food... both in line and once you've ordered, and yet it is not hot. I dare say it's cold. What's going on? I know some places benefit from inefficiency (e.g., Pink's line is slow, but there's always a seat once you get your [hot] food), but this place doesn't seem to have a reason. So, I ask--if my food was ready, why was it sitting around getting cold? Bottom line: The food has potential, but until they learn to serve it hot, I won't be back on my dime.",2 star rating,Rebecca P.

The pork was a little fatty, bit worth I for the flavor. My favorite was the melted cheese. It was more sharp than a traditional queso fresco, an really made them stand out above the plain tacos. There are definitely no frills at this place. Old school, but being done right.",5 star rating,Dylan K.

3/25/2019,"Isla Vista, CA","This little taco shop has been on my Santa Barbara food bucket list for a long time. Finally got to try it! The service was speedy and friendly, and the tacos quite delicious. There are lots of vegetarian and cheese-free options, for those who need them, and the price is fairly decent. Salsas we're tasty, and the homemade tortillas are phenomenal! Lilly's Taqueria in Goleta remains my favorite taco stop in the area; I enjoy the exotic meat choices, and certainly more options for toppings. However, for a good taco place that's immediately downtown, look no further than La Super Rica!",4 star rating,Emily V.

We ordered chorizo quesadillas, the Super Rica Especial, tacos de calabacita, an agua Fresca de sandia (watermelon), and a coffee with canela and piloncillo. So tasty that we ended up returning for more quesadillas the same day. On the second trip we had to wait a really long time for our food, which was a little frustrating because we just wanted a quick snack. But overall, this place lives up to the hype.",5 star rating,Megan T.

Food was flavorful... but those LONG LINES! Be prepared on weekends. Ahead of us were about 20 LOUD and obnoxious church youth group members who were acting like they were newly released to civilization - didn't know how to handle themselves in public. They took over the joint, ran around spazzed out for food, killed all vibes as we couldn't hear one another at our table, succeeded at giving us anxiety and temporarily hating life. This clearly affected the entire experience here lol. I am forever scarred from the horrifying thought of returning to this joint to find high sprung virgins saving themselves for heysoos & tacos. If there is a God, make your people more considerate of others in public settings. Amen. Now for the food. Really enjoyed the Lomito Suizo which was more like a pastor quesadilla. The meat was deliciously marinated, tender, flavorful, very cheesy. Masa was fresh and grilled perfectly. Just wish the serving was larger in size. Portion was the size of the smallest packaged tortillas you'd find at markets. Their Pork Tamal was equally good, masa wasn't overly dry as it tends to be with Mexican tamales. The broth it was topped with was a little too loose in viscosity for my liking, very soupy, but flavors were all there. Prices are higher than what you'd pay for in L.A. as I could get the same for 1/2 the price, but you're in S.B. where everything is overpriced. If I were in the area I'd stop by only if there was no insane line and to get the Lomito Suizo & Pork Tamales.",3 star rating,MarMar Q.

We came here cuz a good friend recommended this place but maybe we didn't order the right stuff cuz it was honestly just meh.I've had my share of Mexican food and this place didn't bring anything more or less than the average taqueria that's sprinkled all throughout LA. We got the beef and chicken fajitas but they weren't mind blowing like they were made out to me.I thought the meat was a little overcooked, the flavor was just fine and again, nothing too phenomenal to run home and write about. The wait was way too long for the mediocre food and seating arrangements are so limited- first come, first serve.. oh, and they have like 3 parking spaces so you have to drive around and look for a spot.. in my opinion, unless you really really want to try this joint, it isn't anything special so don't waste your time standing in line",3 star rating,Raiza C.

7/30/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","This is one of those places that you go to, wait in the like that looks like it should take 10 mins but takes 30 and you leave super disappointed. It's famous because it's Julia Child's favorite Mexican spot. Well, let me tell you something about Julia Child (besides her being a CIA agent), she was a huge fan of my ex's family so, based on that, you should know that her taste might be a little suspect. We liked the watermelon agua fresca and the coffee was good too but the meat tended to be chewy and bland. Actually I think bland describes most of the food here. Including the salsa. And for those of you who are all pumped about the home made tortillas, I'm sorry. One thing we got that we didn't expect was copious amounts of oil. So, I mean, extra negative bonus stars for that.

Know this: CASH ONLY!They are slinging the corn tortillas fresh. (always a plus) I tried the rajas con queso, special chicken chile relleno and a spicy bean gordita. The man taking the order reinforced: it is VERY spicy. And it was indeed! whew - so good.The chicken chile relleno was especially flavorful! The rajas were grilled to perfection and smothered in cheese. The Spicy Bean Gordita was especially spicy (as warned) and chased the heat with a Modelo - all is good with the world.Getting to order takes a long time. One man taking the order, then serving the drinks, etc.. but once you order and are seated, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.Fresh, good - and if you ask me: worth the wait.

With that being said...the tortillas were DELICIOUS! I got al pastor tacos. I'm not one to pay more than $1.50 p/taco & here they charge $2.50 (which I think is a little overpriced given that the dollar tacos in LA are so much better!) Not mad at this establishment's hustle though for over charging tacos in a predominantly affluent Caucasian area lol!

8/15/2016,"Delray Beach, FL","Holy authentic Mexican food! This place is amazing and the food is more authentic than the food I had in Mexico. A local took me here and let me know it is a Santa Barbara staple- I quickly learned why. You can watch them cooking through glass windows, where you find a woman hand-making tortillas on a press- unreal! I don't eat meat but even the vegetarian options here are so flavorful meat eaters wouldn't know the difference (though they of course have plenty of meat options as well). I'm obsessed with tamales- they were perfectly spiced with a little kick, cream sauce was delicious and flavorful and everything cooked perfectly. By my friends suggestion I had the Rajas which also blew my mind- full of flavor and delicious. They have complementary fresh salsa with chopped tomato, cilantro, jalepeno and whatever else is in there which I could have eaten as a side all on it's own. La Super-Rica is an experience and not to be missed if you're visiting or a local.The food is fresh, delicious and inexpensive.

12/22/2014,"Artesia, CA","In the past few years, I've had horchatas from here every time I'm visiting Santa Barbara. My most recent trip was the first time I've tried their food. First off, it is one of those places where you order in line and then wait for your order to be called. There is decent amounts of seating in a well-covered area adjacent to the shack. The major standout part about this place is the huge portion size! For example, a ""taco"" consists of two pieces of fresh tortilla and a plate full of meat and toppings! Definitely consider this, as you will be fine ordering one less portion. I ordered non-vegetarian pozolo with hominy, avocado, lime wedges, and radish, which is a menudo-like dish. It's sort of comfort food-ish without being overly salty, which was exactly what I was looking for. My cousin and I shared a large horchata, and the serving size was actually much smaller than I anticipated (a medium-sized Dixie cup) with ice. Granted, the horchata is extremely concentrated and a bit on the sweeter side, but I still expected the drink portion to be larger. I did like how cinnamon-y it was though. You can ask for water where you pick up your order. Overall, this seems like a very involved family business. The tiny kitchen is filled with people doing various jobs. I was pleasantly surprised that one woman was literally getting the dough, flattening it, and cooking it into hot tortillas. All the workers were very polite and nice, and service was decently quick considering it was during a weekend dinner rush. If you are looking for a quick and super casual taco joint in Santa Barbara, this is it.",3 star rating,Phoebe C.
4/1/2016,"Unionville, Canada","Came here because of all the rave reviews and the fact that this is Julia Child's favourite taco ""stand"". I definitely had high expectations only to be greatly disappointed. We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, tacos, quesadillas, some of the items that come in a bowl with tortillas on the side and horchatas. Tacos are just the meat with two tortillas underneath. Assembly is required, this is pretty much the case with most items here. Meat was dry but tasty, the sauces the provide were kind of bland which is very unfortunate as the tacos could have really used something to add juiciness. Quesadillas was decent. I think of everything this was my favourite, the cheese used was delicious and they do not hold back on it. There were also some items that came in a bowl, I believe it was menu items above 15? Totally not what I expected. The pinto bean dish and cheese with tomato sauce were like soups, very difficult to eat. They were ok tasting. Nothing special I would say. One common theme across all items is the tortilla. Hand made and cooked to order, I personally had better so was not impressed unfortunately. I like the idea that they are freshly made though.Horchata was pretty good! It is the first one I've ever had but very tasty. I would say it was a little bit sweet though. But if you are here I would recommend getting it.",3 star rating,Derwei C.

Nothing special, just average, not worth trying again.Item # 8 Alambre de Pechuga- Grilled chicken breast with bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Chicken was over cooked and dry.

The tacos de rajas were superior. The Bistec and Adobado tacos were lackluster in appearance and very ordinary tasting. The tortillas are all handmade so that made them better. The queso fundido con chorizo was actually made with some sort of longaniza sausage and by the time we got it the cheese was already hardened. I would not order that again. Next time we'll order the rajas, chile relleno, and corn with zucchini and tamales. Not sure I'll wait next time. And make sure you have cash. No cards accepted.",3 star rating,Loretta F.

I'm almost always a steak fan, but the adobado was hands down better. Meat was great, flavor was great, and their salsas are top notch. I was a bit disappointed in the bisteca taco, as the meat was a bit less flavorful and seemed too much on the well done side.Fairly casual atmosphere (plus it was pouring when we went), service was fine, no complaints.

12/31/2013,"Irvine, CA","I'd heard from several sources how great this place was. The line out the door seemed to agree. Well, maybe it's good for Santa Barbara, but certainly not if you've had really good Mexican food before. It's cheap for Santa Barbara, but still pretty expensive if you consider the fact that there's little service provided and they clearly spend nothing on aesthetics.I ordered the tri-tip and a Norteno tamale, along with horchata. My fiancee had some carne asada tacos. Once you order, you can go sit in the dingy room adjacent to the entrance. I don't particularly care about ambiance, but this place has none. There is a salsa bar with a red and a green salsa, neither of which were any good. As you'd expect with such long lines, our food took a long time to come out (20 or 30 minutes probably). And when it did, I wished we hadn't bothered. I've never had tr-tip so tasteless. And it was chock full of onions, which I hate, but were not mentioned on the menu. The tamale was fine but again, not worth the wait. The horchata was the one redeeming factor. It's not the best I've had, but it was certainly better than average.

Five stars for this item alone.I've tried almost everything on the menu over the years, including plenty of their specials. Their tacos are simple and packed with meat. I love their salsa roja; it's perfect on top of most of the tacos, especially the taco de bistek. Or the marinated pork. Or the pollo. Or whatever you choose on any particular day. And did I mention the freshly made tortillas? So delicious!Note: you will spend more than you expect here because one (or two or three) tacos is not enough, so bring extra cash.

The food isn't free-range or organic yes (horror, you have to wait outside in the sunshine in line) and maybe it's not going to wow an East-Coaster (some of these reviews defy logic.) But I've lived here my whole life and I appreciate a good SB taco or burrito when I taste one. There's a reason that this place is so popular and it's definitely not because of Yelp. It had lines going out the door and down the street BEFORE THE INTERNET EXISTED. In the good old days, if you didn't speak Spanish viably, you might not have gotten what you expected. Mostly local Mexicans used to frequent this place and you'd see the odd gringo in line (and yes, sometimes Julia Child) so that's a testament to how authentic this place can be with it's choices. The homemade tortillas a revelation (made with white corn, not yellow, a huge difference.) If you're used to East Coast Mexican food (what on earth is that, really?)....well, you will probably be disappointed.

Not because of the paper plates and plastic forks. (It is a taqueria.)It's all about the food. Same owner and same quality for 30 plus years. Many people like the pork special or the chicken suiza. Everyone loves the home made corn tortillas. That line half way up the block says it all.Me, I love the weekly specials. Tamale verde with cream sauce. A great veggie stuffed chili relleno. Mmmm.The home made horchata is delish! Be sure to get a glass.Still my favorite Mexican eatery, in California or anywhere. Bon Appetit!",5 star rating,Francesca S.

I had the pozole, tamal, taco bistec, and horchata. Yum. The line was long, but most places with good food is long. The best part is that they don't make the tortilla until you place an order, so it guaranteed fresh.",4 star rating,Lester F.

There's a dozen or so taco shops on this street that look the same, but this was the only one with a line. The steak tacos are super good.

9/14/2013,"San Luis Obispo, CA","We had to check this place out with all the Julia Child hype!  Though I definitely think it was fun to try once - I can see why it has some mixed reviews!  It's definitely not your typical Americanized Mexican food - so don't go in expected that.  We tried the steak tacos, pork tacos, quesadilla, chille relleno with cream, horchata, and cafe de olla.  Here's the Pros & Cons:Pros:  - Yummy & soft tortillas - they seem very fresh!- The Horchata was delicious -  Very flavorful!!- The Cafe de olla we got iced and that was also surprisingly good! Cons- The line! They open at 11am and we got there at 11:06am - there was already a relatively small line forming.  The staff seemed pretty slow and we waited in line much longer than expected.  There's no shade so bring a hat & sunscreen!-  The lack of flavors and ingredients in the tacos.  The tacos were simply meat and tortilla.  No cheese, no lettuce, no spices, no veggies, no tomatoes... just literally meat and tortilla!!  This made them pretty plain : (.  The meat wasn't even special.  You can add your own salsa -- but the salsas are nothing to get excited about.- The lack of side-dishes.  You get exactly what you order.  This is no fun because our typical Americanized-Mexican restaurants usually give you chips, beans, rice, etc.  So, I missed my sides!",3 star rating,Aubrie A.

8/13/2013,"Berkeley, CA","Warning: I was really hungover and I waited in line for close to an hour. I'd never do that again here, but I would definitely return if I could forgo that line. To be honest, between two of us we ordered 6 things and they all tasted the same. All was definitely on the bland side and I needed to literally douse my food in hot sauce to get any flavor. To top it off, the meat was really dry. The fresh made tortillas are the star of the show and they know it. Pretty much everything you order is served with two. The pinto beans with bacon are a pass. Soupy, flavorless, this was the worst. The guac with tortillas wasn't anything special and the tacos were definitely more of the highlighted dish here, but Lillys blows them out of the water. This is a celebrated spot in SB so hit it if you can get here without waiting in line. If that's not possible I'd recommend moving on.",2 star rating,Stephanie Y.

1/10/2012,"Sunland, CA","This is not ""typical Mexican"" food. If you are looking for a taqueria that has what Californians think of as traditional tacos, this is NOT the place to go. Go find a taco truck or typical taqueria. My understanding is that La Super-Rica IS traditional Mexican, but not from the area of Mexico that most Californians are used to. So if you are going to go, go with an open mind. IF you do, you will LOVE it!!!Whenever I am in the area I have to go to La Super-Rica, even if I only get a cup of Mexican coffee. It is phenomenal.

9/28/2015,"Monterey, CA","La Super- Rica is highly reviewed and I was excited to try it. I must be honest, I am not as obsessed with it as others are. I appreciate the fresh homemade tortillas but I think they could be cooked a little more and made thicker. The meat juice and salsa make the homemade tortilla soggy quickly. You must eat fast! Their steak tacos are standard, nothing mouth watering but not disappointing either. The dishes with the melted cheese help to add flavor to their dishes. For example, I'd recommend getting their Lomito Suzio rather than a pork taco. Their vegetable tamale is delicious. It is steamed perfectly. I enjoyed the cream sauce too. If you like a lot of flavor and salty, I wouldn't recommend the cream sauce. If you want a lighter taste, I think you will enjoy it. Regardless, I'd still come back.

But with all due respect to the wonderful Doug--a great guy and gourmet alike--La Super Rica SUCKS. Julia Child is the ONLY REASON this place is still around and doing a booming business. It continues to be on ""must hit"" places and the New York Times mentioned it yet again in the last year.  And as he noted it was over 20 years ago she made a big deal about it. It is a cockroach incubator for one thing, a phrase I got from a Wisconsin FB and phone friend as well as huge gourmet and foodie. Extremely nice staff. But people who go there are tourists. I tried it again after some 15 years and remembered why I didn't go there thereafter. And it's NOT cheap. My lunch was 10 bucks. I mean that's no big thing but for 10 bucks I can get much better Mexican food elsewhere. Affirmatively BAD guacamole. Not subpar. Bad. I will never go there again. I tried a squash taco special and it was goupy and greasy. They should donate to Julia Child charities and kneel in prayer daily.

I had to wait an extra 30 minutes and was forced to wait at the window begging them to just get my drink. I didn't pay for such garbage service and food. Literally, the tacos at Taco Bell are 10x better than the shit I received. It's absolutely embarrassing to even see Mexicans sitting down enjoying the food. Why is there even a line????

Luckily, the menu is large so we all found things that sounded good to us. Overall we ended up with a side of guac, the #16, the #7, and a tamale. The pictures online made it look like the portions were huge (as Mexican food in America is usually), but our poor stomachs were very wrong. The plates were very small and just didn't have that much flavor. The homemade tortillas were definitely the strong part of the meal - very fluffy and warm.

It's one guy at the counter taking written orders using an old school cash register. It's not exactly efficient but perhaps that's part of the charm? The line was pretty long and it didn't move fast.

12/30/2015,"Santa Maria, CA","Summary: overrated. tasteless food, long wait that isn't worth it, and more pricey than it seems. Go elsewhere..........We came on a Sunday night around 7 and waited 40 minutes to get our food. So be prepared to wait while hungry if you do decide to come to this taqueria. It's about how much you might wait at a popular restaurant without a reservation.We ordered our food, which was the beef tacos, tamales, quesadilla with pork, guacamole, and the side of beans. While the prices were seemingly low, for the amount we paid we felt like we should have gotten more food. about 2-3 items would just satisfy but not fill a person. It was about 50$ for a family of 4 after drinks and all. The food wasn't as great as any of us expected it to be. The beef for the tacos was dry, and plain. I would have expected some sauce or something but it was just tortilla and meat. I understand thats the style of the food but it wasn't particularly tasteful so why bother. Wouldn't want them again if I had a choice. The tamales were better in flavor(they were vegetarian) but in 2 of the 4 we ordered, we found pieces of plastic lodged in the middle of the tamale! We concluded they were those zipper sliders from ziploc plastic bags. Not edible! Really?So yeah, its overrated.

Warning, there are no onions or cilantro on top like the typical tacqueria tacos. Lime is not available and must be asked for.  They literally just give you meat on tortillas.  I suggest you get the ones with other toppings (like cheese...I'm lactose so couldn't).  Maybe I'd have to come back and try some other meat.  Also, there are no burritos here.  Disappointed since this place is highly rated.Side note: they speak perfect English here",3 star rating,Linda H.
2/14/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I really don't get it.  Super long lines al large time.  Food is okay, but I'm not standing in a line for it.  I suspect they are riding in their reputation as Julia Child's favorite Mexican food restaurant, but I would rather go south down the street to really excellent Mexican food and skip the wait.",5 star rating,Dan L.
3/11/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","I've had a love affair with La Super Rica Taqueria for 20 plus years.  In all that time I've never been disappointed and have always walked away more than satisfied.  No trip to Santa Barbara would be complete without at least one meal from La Super Rica!  I am so addicted to their food that I will wait outside the restaurant 15 min prior to opening (trust me, I am not the only one).  But even if you end up going during the rush-hour, the line moves pretty quickly.  So be patient...it is worth it!  You would think that after all these years I'd have the menu memorized and wouldn't need to even look at it.  But because we end up ordering about 8 items (3 items to eat at the restaurant and 5 or more items to take home), I always bring a pen and paper to write down my order.  Although our list frequently changes, we always order #16 Super Rica Especial, #6 Rajas, #19 Frijole Super Rica and #20 Gordita de Frijole.  Ordering works like this...you place your order at the window, pay, get your receipt, and find a table.  They will call your number once the food is ready.  There's a mini salsa self-service near the pick-up window.  Trust me get a few containers of salsa to go with your meal.  The salsa are fresh, spicy, and delicious.  The kitchen is extremely small but so efficient.  There is one person taking orders, one lady making corn tortillas, and 2 cooks on the grill/flat-top.  I don't know how they all fit...but it seems to work for them.  The food is tasty, perfectly seasoned, made with fresh ingredients, and authentic.   This is homestyle cooking at its finest...warm, satisfying, and comforting.",5 star rating,Kelly K.

6/17/2017,"Los Angeles, CA",The tacos are well made. The tortillas are super fresh because they are made in house.  The chicken is grilled and not greasy but not well seasoned.  It took about 20 minutes for just two tacos with guacamole and an horchata... kinda long a simple order.

8/17/2015,"Hamilton, Canada","As a tourist, after the build up of Julia Child's history with the place, as well as many sources recommending this as a must-stop along the California coast, we were disappointed that La Super-Rica wasn't all it was chalked up to be.After about a 20 minute wait in a relatively short line, we had to make a quick decision on what we wanted- I would suggest a menu on the outside of the Taqueria, it might speed up the line!  We made some random choices as to what we thought looked good, and waited another 20 minutes or so for our order to be available.  Out of the 5 dishes we ordered, several seemed relatively flavourless, and the others seemed like a bunch of meat and veggies piled on the flat tacos.  They were difficult to eat, and although the dishes were different, three of them tasted almost the same.  The best were the pork tacos, but it went downhill after that... which left us pretty disappointed.  Honestly, the best part of the experience were the hot sauces which we used to enhance the dishes to our tastes.I usually try to have an optimistic outlook on restaurants, knowing that if I don't like it, maybe it's just not my taste, but this one just didn't live up to what we were expecting!It didn't help that there was a huge group of parents and kids who were being pretty disrespectful of surrounding diners, which was pretty annoying.",2 star rating,Emily B.

The tacos came bare with no onion or cilantro and no option to add them on the side. There wasn't even lime available. As a Mexican, I can attest that this place is not authentic.

Wrapped around the building.*Closed Wednesdays*Cash Only I think I spent around $16 for this meal since I wanted to taste a variety of things from the menu.

Each taco was unique.  The flavors were right on the button.Some of the best tacos I have ever tried.  It's a simple place where you chose your food, pay for it, and then find a seat.  Their seating area is spacious, bright, and sunny.  When they call your number, you eat.  The only real problem is it's just a bit too far to try everything else again soon.I will dream about their mushroom taco.",5 star rating,Harry K.

2/26/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","This should be 10 stars. I am a chef, and have had plenty of absurdly expensive food - it is all meaningless, what matters is the chef's understanding of balance and that only comes from great people, price is irrelevant. Ahhhh how to begin to describe the authenticity and joyfulness that is put into this food. When I was around 8 years old, one of my friends took me to a community swimming pool that was nearby. After, his mom took us to La Superica (just a taco stand with a tent and a long line). I distinctly remember the feeling of the handmade corn tortilla and its shockingly pancake-like texture and flavor and smell - perfectly complimented with the skirt steak. I was a really picky eater back then - hamburger with bun, NOTHING ELSE. Well I remember that it was SO GOOD that I swallowed half of it without chewing and had to pull it back out hahahahaha. Sorry TMI but that is my fond memory and I'm sharing it. A super picky 8 year old conquered in one bite. Now, don't you dare come at me asking for nachos and burritos, and say anything absurd about this restaurant like a comparison. This is a unique work of culinary art, and and unique experience. If Martin and Isadoro wanted to plate this in a fancy restaurant they could and it would cost 3x more. Here is my recommendation:Get all tortillas on the side and get extra, with some guak. Get the #16 with your choice of meat - they are all great and happy to substitute. Get the rajas. Get the horchatta.The specials are all outstanding.Bring cash. Make friends with the owners, they are good people.",5 star rating,Shaun O.

The corn tortillas are especially good- soft and fresh you can tell there are only a few ingredients in the food here and that's what makes it so good. You can tell the kitchen has been cooking this way for a long time. The special vegetarian tamale with sauce on top is great, it has corn and melted cheese inside.

We ordered the chorizo quesadilla (DELICIOUS, IT WAS GRILLED TO ABSOLUTE PERFECTION) and couple tacos with different types of meat such as the adobada, al pastor, and steak. They were all good. The tortilla is also made fresh daily which makes a difference. Where I come from (los angeles), taco eateries are numerous so I'm pretty picky when it comes to my mexican food but I really liked this place.

Not only is the food amazing, the experience was special.  You order from a little window off of a chalkboard from a sweet old man who writes down your orders on an old school check while you fumble in your wallet for cash because you are distracted from watching a sweet woman in their tiny kitchen make homemade tortillas from scratch - that is a memory I won't forget. We all ordered way too much (which was fine because we took everything back for leftovers!) Then the food comes out and it's authentically delicious. Our highlights were the chile relleno, steak tacos, mexican rice, and the enchilada special. I will seriously dream about this place. This is a must for a Santa Barbara trip and one day I will go back it will be the first place I go again! I can see why this was Julia Child's favorite.",5 star rating,Rachel B.

I also ordered a chorizo quessadilla which was not bad and a bacon butter cheese something that was actually pretty darn good.  Though I should have eatten it first because it bacame all gooey buy the time I got to it. My companion ordered the pork soup that was filled with greesy stuff was okay except I myst be careful because too much grease can give me the thumbs down for the day if you know what I mean.

We waited 45 minutes to order even though there were only about 10 parties ahead of us and then proceeded to wait another 45-50 minutes for our food. There is something endearing and eclectic about the line out the door, but they were just slow on this particular Friday @ 4pm. The food is worth one of the waits, the prices are mediocre.

2/18/2015,"Tarzana, CA","Being from LA, I was a little skeptical about a taqueria in Santa Barbara. Even my boyfriend was not too convinced after seeing the white-to-hispanic people ratio of the patrons at La Super Rica. I'm also positive that this place is still riding on the hype of the Julia Child mention; I doubt half these people would've been drawn to ever visit this little taco shack without her.Having said that, everything was pretty decent. I got the #16 that everyone is raving out. It was good-- marinated pork with slices of pasilla chiles covered with monterey jack, sitting atop 3 tortillas. Eat this one fast. Coagulated cheese at room temperature isn't the greatest. I love peppers so I appreciated that the chiles weren't soggy and cooked to submission.If this place had one really notable thing going for it, it was the fresh pressed tortillas. That really gave their tacos, otherwise just meat atop a tortilla, an edge. If you're fond of onions & cilantros on your tacos, you'll have to ask for some from the kitchen staff; they don't offer it at the salsa bar.Next time, I want to try the pozole!",4 star rating,Sophie B.

8/30/2012,"Costa Mesa, CA","Expect the line for this not so secret hole in the wall to extend far out the front door, and keep you waiting in excited-but-anxious anticipation for some time.  I am by no means an expert of the Santa Barbara area, but by first hand account from those who have lived in the area and/or visited more frequently than I, this is THE place for cheap but delicious and unique eats.Everything on the menu at this place is pretty amazing, so you really can't go wrong with any of the vast number of choices.  From the horchata that just has a little more kick to it than you might normally expect, to the rich, fresh, gooey cheese found on/in most items, to the soft tortillas which are made fresh, on the spot.Most items range in price from around 3 to 5 bucks; but expect to not be able to control yourself when you order several of them, racking up a bill of around 15 well spent dollars per person.You won't be able to resist ordering at least a few things, if not many.  Straight up.  But my tip to you is this: Make sure one of them is the #6 (""Rajas"").  You're welcome in advance.",5 star rating,Aaron L.

The tacos are delicious, they have a good variety. I have also had several of their different tamales that they offer on the special menu. They are all good! I also like the Chile relleno, it is served with a cream sauce that is to die for... order many different items, the portions aren't huge... you can always take home the leftovers, they'll still be delicious the next day.

8/23/2012,"Phoenix, AZ","I had one more meal to enjoy on the road in my journey down the California coast. I had to enjoy it here. I ordered two tacos and their version of a pork quesadilla, with a large horchata. It came out to just over $11, and it was way too filling. Next time, I'd just stick with two items. The tacos could have been split up into four tiny ones. The tortillas, salsas, and pico de gallo were great! The meat was a tad on the dry side, but still tasted good.

They appear to make each order as it's placed, and I think that's why the line moves so slowly. And that ""made to order"" freshness can't be beat. The seasoning is perfect in each menu item, and the salsa is homemade and sabrosa. The front counter people are muy agradable and don't rush you in any way. I also like their coffee. They make it with plioncillo (Mexican brown sugar). The most expensive item on the menu was around $6, but dishes generally cost $2.50-3.50. Two people can easily get stuffed for less than $20 (with drinks). Real Mexican food at an affordable price is well worth your wait, and it's inexpensiveness justifies their cash only policy.",5 star rating,Brian D.

Such is the way of things I suppose when you are trying to appeal to as many people as possible. Their food is still really good though. We ordered their adobado tacos, guac, quesadilla, pasilla chile stuffed with pork and cheese, and horchata. It was the perfect amount for the two of us, though we could definitely have eaten more. The flavors are authentic here, they even have freshly made tortillas done within view while waiting to order. Pretty awesome. The prices are cheap and service is pretty quick.

The 2 stuffed tortillas with the beans was so disgusting and I've had better guacamole at a bazillion establishments. My boys said the tacos were horrible. They looked so dry. Even the salsa was disgusting. I'm just perplexed why this place is so popular.

My wife and I have been here at least 5 times and every single time I've came, I left extremely satisfied with the food. No one beats their home made tortillas. No one in town even has some of the amazing tamales they have! Their beer bottles are super cheap too. Nothing negative to say about this place! If you aren't sure what to get, get anything, because everything is great and there is nothing on the menu that would involve an ""acquired taste"". Well worth the wait.

1/30/2012,"Seattle, WA","I absolutely detest the place!I never thought coming from Seattle I would say that the tacos in SB are atrocious, you would just assume California to be superior in every way when it came to the taco, however Super Rica and it's hype are a sad cry for a taco. The meat is chewy, unseasoned, fatty, and leaves you unable to decipher which part of the animal you're eating. The salsas bland and tasteless at their best. The prices unreasonable for the quantity and caliber of food. The only redeeming factor is the mildly personable staff.Having given the place a few chances, I just can't seem to understand why the place is so popular. Perhaps I'm eating the wrong items, or am just spoilt. But I would urge anyone traveling to Seattle to try La Taqueria Rinconsito in Burien, for a real taco.",1 star rating,Priya P.

Tacos overall are damn good.Cons: tacos are minimum three ingredients and these are very sparse. I don't have a problem with that per Se but .... semenatics and throw some chives on them.

8/18/2012,"El Monte, CA","A friend told me about this place. Not your ordinary Mexican taco stand. There was a line but it went quickly in my opinion. Don't go too hungry because there is a line to order and wait for food. Since the cooks only use one grill, the food takes a bit to get out. The tortillas are made by hand. And all the meat is grilled fresh on the stop. Not your typical menu of burritos and tacos. They specialize in chile rellenos, rajas, chorizo (but not the typical breakfast kind), and grilled green peppers and onions. I order the rajas which came on a corn tortilla with cheese and onions and the chorizo quesadilla.  Note: the portions are not big so plan to order 2-3 things.",5 star rating,lisette m.

5/26/2019,"Torrance, CA","Standing in line with 20 people ahead means waiting for an hour to order and then another 10 minutes for the food to come out. Food is great and Julia Child was spot on about the handmade tortillas being the best. It's even better when they are made one by one in front of your eyes (great marketing). As for the food, being from LA, Mexican food like this is fortunately very common, and outside of the delicious tortillas, and Julia Child recognition, it would be just another Mexican restaurant. The chorizo quesadilla was ok, although I prefer the chorizo to be more greasy and less chunky than the homemade one served here. The adobada was good, not great, and the Pasilla Chile special was the one thing I would probably order over and over again since it definitely stood out. The special pork tamale with tomato cream sauce, no offense, wasn't that special but once again, it's because we are exposed to great Mexican food all the time in LA. Parking is all street parking too so you may need to drive around a little. And it's all cash that is accepted",4 star rating,B O.

Best tortillas I've ever had & if you're an East Coast rube like me you'll be psyched you can watch them making the tortillas. However, like all the best spots, it requires some work to enjoy. Check the hours: the past few summers we've come to find they're closed not just Wednesdays like it says on their Facebook page and has always been the case, but also Tuesdays. Which you'd only know if you arrived and saw the hand-written sign on the door. I'm not sure why this information couldn't make it to their Facebook.

Nephew had a quesadilla... which he pronounced ""excellente!"". Not bad for a kid who doesn't speak spanish, yeah? And the house-made salsa's were great! Needless to say, we were on the way up the coast to Pismo Beach and got a hankering for lunch as we reached Santa Barbara.  Remembering this was Julia Child's fav go-to Mex place, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Yup, it's divey. Yup, it's got a cheap-as-all-get-out roof over the eating area. Yup, the place has a crappy selection of sodas and drinks...and their menu is a bit limited - but OH the flavors are great!

10/22/2013,"Glendale, CA","This place is way too overrated. The prices are cheap but you have to spend at least $20 to get full (I'm an average guy with an average appetite). The food did not have taste or flavor. You get no sides with your order and the tacos are just meat and tortilla. The quality of the steak was poor and the chicken was undercooked. How do you mess up with chicken? I wouldn't get food from here if it was free. The fresh watermelon drink was not worth it as it was half filled with ice and huge chunks of watermelon. It only sounds good. The only good item they have is the fresh guacamole, but they don't even give you chips with it. What kind of a Mexican restaurant is this? I am shocked from the other yelp reviewers. When I left I had to double check that I had come to the right place. I would not give this place a chance again.",1 star rating,Zara Y.
11/12/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","I don't believe the hype most of the time, but La Super-Rica Taqueria does live up to the hype.  Its a little pricey, relatively speaking.  In the land of $1.50 taco, La Super Rica's taco costs $2.50 each.  The wait can be long and food arrive slowly since everything is made to order.  You can watch the magic happen in the glass enclosed kitchen.  In exchange for the long wait, you get fresh warm tortilla generously filled with seasoned grilled meat that's a step above in quality compare to the other little taqueria.  Besides various tacos, I think their best item is actually the vegetable tamale.  Moist and tender masa encloses a sweet and slightly crunchy vegetable mixture consists of corn, chayote, and zucchini.  A cream and cheese sauce serves on top of the tamale adds even more richness and flavor to the dish.  I also enjoyed #19.  Its an innocuous looking bean soup, then you taste it, and get a mouthful of savory porky bacony essence that make you feel a little guilty eating such rich dish.     I am not giving this place a perfect 5/5 since there are comparable places in the neighborhood that are less famous, and therefore, less wait time.  For example, El Bajio and La Colmena, both on Milpas, serve very respectable tacos.",4 star rating,Lily Z.

It has bell pepper, marinated pork, and cheese in three freshly hand made tortillas. It's a must try! The only thing I don't like is the tamale. Being from LA I've have to say I've tasted better tamales. They put this sauce on top the tamale that I just can't bring myself to like. I guess it's an acquired taste.

9/18/2011,"Surprise, AZ","I lived in Santa Barbara for 6 years yet never made it here until today.  I guess I just never went down to Milpas street when I lived up there....well....except for that one time during Fiesta when I was piss drunk, came out of the club and made a left instead of a right and kept walking.  Next thing you know I am at the Jack In The Box on Milpas standing next to a grip of trannies using the pay phone to call a cab to pick my drunk ass up and take me home.....ahhh.....memories of being young and stupid  LOL.Showed up around 11:45 on Saturday and there were only about 6 people ahead of us in line.  Placed my order which was a number 7 (tri tip and bacon with bell peppers and onions) a number 9 (cheese quesadilla) and a number 16 (roasted chilies, cheese and pork).  That and a Mandarin Jarritos came out to about $17 bucks.  Paid the man my money and took a seat.  10 minutes later my food was ready.  Here is how they stacked up.Number 9- Basic cheese quesadilla between 2 hand made corn tortillas.  Simple but really good.  Some of the cheese was browned and crunchy that was stuffed inside.  Really good and I would get this again for sure.Number 7-  Tri tip, bacon, onions and bell peppers with 3 corn tortillas.  This one was just ok.  The meat was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The bacon pieces in there were just ok.  The peppers and onions were great though.  I ate most of it but I don't think I would get this one again.Number 16-  They stuff a pasilla chile with monterey jack cheese.  They then roast the living hell out of it to make it crispy and to melt the cheese.  Then they mash it up with some tasty pork which reminded me kind of like some crispy bits adobada.  Jesus H this thing was freaking amazing.  It was hands down one of the best foods I think I have ever eaten.  Everything just worked so well.  You got a ton of goopy cheese, a slightly spicy pepper and some excellently marinated pork.  Mashed it all up and made little tacos out of it.  Next time I go, I think I will order 2 of these and make that my meal.  God it was great!  5 stars without a doubt!Overall it was a pretty darn good meal.  The ambiance isn't great, its really pretty simple.  Tables with plastic lawn chairs, a little salsa bar and that's about it.  Prices were fair and the guy taking orders was friendly.  If you go, bypass everything else and just order the Number 16.  Maybe order 2 or 3 of them along with some extra tortillas.  It is simply amazing and I cannot recommend it enough.  I will be dreaming about that thing for weeks to come.",4 star rating,Tim S.

A grilled Pasilla pepper stuffed with cheese swimming in an Alfredo-like sauce with a garnish of parsley, to make you forget it came on a plastic plate.It appears this place has gotten some publicity since then, as I was surprised to find the line around the corner at 2pm on a Sunday.  I thought the tacos were fairly priced at $2.50, until I saw them.  A little bit of meat on 2 tiny palm sized tortillas.  They were fresh, I saw them being made in the sweat factory by the grill when we ordered at the window.  It was really hot and there was no A/C.  The shredded beef taco special of 2 tiny tacos rolled with avocado cream on the side, was way over priced.  Salsa bar was scarce and neither salsas were more than ok.  The chile Rellano con creme was good but not as I remembered.Besides the fact that I was very hungry by the time we got the food, would still say it was fairly average for Mexican food in this area.",3 star rating,Julie Ann M.

My husband had a vegetable tamal that was oh so good.  The 2 of us had a meal with tip for under $30 which is hard to come by in this town.",5 star rating,C K.
12/10/2011,"Newark, CA","Apparently it's a must when in SB and you ""must"" also order the #16. The main ingredient is a Pasilla chili. If you don't like spicy, don't ask for the dish ""mild"" because as the cashier mentioned, they cannot guarantee it -- just depends on the chili you happen to get. And definitely, don't ask for the #16 sans chili if you're spicy food challenged because then it's no longer the #16. (dude in front of me who asked - I mean duuuh.) That being said, I didnt see what all the hype was about the dish. It wasn't very flavorful to me and dry. Instead, order the pork tamal. Best tamal I've ever had. Their masa is the best and it made the tamal super moist. It also had a sauce on top that made it even better. I can't describe it any better other than to just tell you to order it!I'm a little mixed on their tacos. Generous serving of meat over their famous corn tortillas. I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas but La Rica's are definitely freshly made and you can taste the quality. But despite these two things going for it, their tacos are a bit dry and boring. I'd come back here again though, but only for their tamales. Three stars for that, friendly customer service, and a warm and toasty covered dining area in the winter!",3 star rating,Anna R.

Or could it be I can easily locate a taco truck that is at  least sub par to La Super randomly located on any LA street Corner?Thankfully I didn't have to wait in a long line, as I got to the counter I noticed the menu, Some of their menu had prices next to the items, some didn't. ORDER:Two small chicken tacos, beans, 4 steak tacos and a coke $25.00 seemed a bit high for such a hole in the wall joint and super small portions, No receipt was given back with my cash transaction. Chicken tacos had ZERO flavor and were super tiny, 4 tiny asada tacos had no toppings and meat was not seasoned and very dry.After spending $25.00 myself, baby in utero and hubby left hungry. Please Yelpers don't eat here just because a French Chef gave her two cents on this Mexican joint about 20 years plus ago.

I think we waited about 20-30 mins but at the moment that felt like an hour. We sat there poking our salsa and watching other people eat their delicious food. One tip though is - order everything you want when you order. The wait for your addition will probably take you way too long. We tried their tamal and a few other items and we left hungry but too impatient to wait for another round of food. I will definitely be back to this place and try more of their food.",4 star rating,Berenice D.

2/24/2018,"Oak Harbor, WA","I've always heard such great things about this place and always wanted to try it. My husband and I were on our way back home to LA and decided to stop in SB for late lunch. Finding the place was easy and we were lucky enough to find parking easy enough. There was a small line out the door. We were there on Presidents' Day and it wasn't too long of a wait. I've heard that the line could be pretty long. We waited about 10-15 minutes to order. There was a guy in front of us that clearly had been here many times before. He was recommending his favorites to the group in front of him. We decided to try some items he recommended. As a matter of fact, we ordered 6 different items to share. Everything we ordered was amazing. Chicken tacos with cheese, chorizo and cheese tacos, chili rellano, pork and cheese taco, and a couple other amazing items. As we were waiting I was watching the woman hand make the tortillas on the stove. I can't believe all the amazing magic that was going on in that tiny kitchen. So good. I can't wait to go back again. This will definitely be that place we always stop to have lunch when driving north to the central coast.",5 star rating,Ryan J.
6/27/2011,"Marin County, CA","Google ""Julia Child Mexican Santa Barbara"" and you'll find your compass points to La Super-Rica, a simple taqueria with lines out the door thanks to the enduring legacy of Ms. Child, who liked this place.  The menu here pleased me, but not so much my brother, who finds himself on the disaster end of just about every food out there.  Meat?  No.  Poultry?  No.  Dairy?  No.  And sadly for him, those three can be found on about 99% of the menu here.  He sucked one up and decided he'd endure whatever malady befalls him from dairy.  He ordered up some fresh corn tortillas with guacamole and a tamale with some cheese and some crema (amongst other fillings).  I opted for carne asada tacos and a bowl of the special posole with pork.  The tacos were ridiculously straight-forward:  tortillas and meat, end of story.  The posole was dark and rich reddish-brown, with pork, hominy, radish, and onion.  Everything was enhanced by liberal application of serve-yourself, fresh pico de gallo and a thin, flavorful, spicy red salsa.  I was mighty satisfied from my hearty fare and happy to be able to finally check this place off my bucket list.  We checked out for less than $20, but regretted having not ordered drinks on our first pass through the line.  Order everything you want the first time around as you definitely don't want to have to stand in that ever-growing line a second time.  No basket of chips available here nor any seafood, but you probably won't miss it unless, like my brother, you've crossed every other enjoyable menu item off your list.  If I was local, I'd probably be in here once a week.",4 star rating,Tracey A.

No need to wait 45 minutes in line.",2 star rating,Angela P.
1/5/2010,"Santa Barbara, CA","Three stars means A-OK! The food is good, there is a variety of taco options available, and specials like tamales with regional fillings. The price starts to add up when ordering multiple items, but this is the way to go.I liked the chorizo, which seems to have a consistency more of firm sausage, than mushy lymph nodes and salivary glands that I see on the ingredients list of grocery store chorizo. The simple salsa selection focused more on fresh flavors, I did not miss the onions and cilantro that come with other bog standard taquerias that make those tacos taste, unsurprisingly, like onions and cilantro.Super Rica also seems to use roasted chiles often as the main ingredient in their tacos, which I like. Not everything need be piled with meat to be good and filling.But man, is it gringo central. It doesn't take much for the queue to go out the door, since the ordering stand is about two feet from the door, but you will be hard-pressed to find a Mexican or some other latino in that queue. More like soft pink office types, dinks and yuppies. ""OMG, you *have* to try their food, Meghan, it is the BEST! Skylar and I come here after bikram yoga for couples. We should, like, do a playdate here, with our dogs."" So, the ambiance is a fascinating observation of white people who feel they're having an ""authentic experience"" delving into some hole-in-the-wall taqueria in the barrio, either oblivious to the fact that everyone else there is gringo, or still disgruntled at Julia for putting the word out there and ""ruining it for everyone."" (see stuffwhitepeoplelike.com… ) Hey man, it wasn't just Julia, Alias did it, too! Mentioned in two seasons, baby!Or it's white people, doing what they do best: being inconvenienced by their greatest fear: inconvenience.Standing outside in the queue, imho, is the best spot to observe the gringos in fine form. They rendezvous with visiting friends, holding a spot in the queue for 2-10 people that appear out of nowhere, groups arrive in their fancy cars and do a slooooooow drive by to gauge the queue, then send one surly youth out of the car to start queuing up early while they go park. Then you can watch that same BMW go round and round the block several times because there's no parking in front of the eatery and heaven-forbid the car even leaves their sight in this part of town. The locals do walk by, and their faces have a look of both amusement and confusion. Later, that same surly youth that had to pre-queue is sent into the seating area to claim a table. Those poor children, don't the parents care for their safety? I mean, gang turf wars might break out between the book clubs and knitting circles that loiter around there. My visit, did it have all these components? Let's see.Blonde woman two groups in front of me, wearing red cowboy boots and carrying two Coach bags - check!Two women in the group in front of me, grousing the whole time about how there wouldn't be any place to sit once they got to the front - check!Spotless BMW doing a slow drive-by with culturally bi-curious family staring at the queue, mouths agape, sends daughter (with toy dog) out the car to queue early, later sends her to the seating area 30 minutes ahead of ordering - check!Gringo group photos taken inside - check!But regardless, here is MHO on why Super Rica is so popular. For street food style tacos, this town has plenty. But Super Rica has the largest variety of them. They have good combinations, and by that I don't mean combination platters of a taco, an enchilada and big globs of rice and beans. Good combinations of meat, or vegetables or cheese and marinades or spices. The tortillas are made before your eyes. Lots of places do that now, but 10, 15 years ago, Super Rica forged that trail. It's very close to the freeway, and easy to spot with the green trim on the building and the line of folks out the door.Finally, people can't stop talking about it, either word of mouth of in publications.

5/6/2009,"Orange County, CA","When I told my brother that we were headed up to Santa Barbara for a short visit, he immediately recommended that we visit La Super-Rica Taqueria. So, what do we do? Make it our first meal in the city.We pulled in as the sun was setting and were immediately surprised by the smallness of this place. About the size of a garage, this little taqueria was extremely busy. We had about ten people ahead of us in line. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but with a toddler along, I wasn't so sure. After entertaining her with the kitchen antics inside, we eventually made it through the doors...only to wait a few more minutes while we perused the menu. We eventually decided to try several items: tamal verduras (filled with chayote, corn, zucchini, potato, chile strips, and cheese), tacos de chuleta (grilled strips of pork steak), tacos de adobado (strips of marinated pork steak), and the Super-Rica Especial (roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese; served with marinated pork and three tortillas).My favorite, by far, was the taco de chuleta. The meat is super tasty, cooked thin and crispy, and served up on two of the freshest corn tortillas you'll ever shove down your throat (they're probably twenty or thirty seconds old by the time they make it to your table). The tamal was tasty, but had a slight bitterness that nearly ruined it for me. I found the taco de adobado to be just okay, but the Super-Rica Especial was pretty memorable. The roasted pasilla chile strips atop the marinated pork and tortillas gave a nice smokiness to the dish. It was well-balanced and deserves a try in my book. Overall, I found the food to be really good. I just hate long waits and trying to eat when people are constantly checking out your food. 4-1/2 stars really.If you're ever in the Santa Barbara area, you should definitely check out La Super-Rica. Just be forewarned that this place is always busy.",4 star rating,Arnold E.

It seemed like prices were cheap, reviews on yelp seemed good as well, but I just didnt think it was worth it. The portions were really small, we waited what seemed like forever.

2/14/2016,"Seal Beach, CA","This was a great place! It was nice and local and didn't have many empty parking spaces. :pThere was a long line that went out the door, and it wasn't that hard to miss since the whole building was painted bright bluish-green. I almost thought it was the wrong place, until I saw the little sign on the window. I brought my 2 dogs, waited 45 minutes, just to find out that it wasn't dog friendly. I had to order my food to go, which wasn't the best thing to do in my situation because I had driven 3 hours to eat lunch and experience Santa Barbra. I wanted to eat inside the restaurant so I could rest- not have to take it to go! The employees were friendly but didn't come across as ""too friendly"". The people were great but the food was another story. I ordered one #1 two #4s and one #15. Number one was OK: The tortillas were great, you can almost taste the hard work they put into it! The beef was bland and rubbery. YUCK!  Number four was REALLY GOOD!: The pork was nice and tender, a little marbled, and was awesomely flavored. It had a little twang and spice to it. The tortillas were made with love. These two tacos (the #4s) Were AWESOME!!!! I would seriously recommend  you NOT order #15. Its not a taco at all. They put bacon and melted cheese in a cup and give you 3 tortillas to eat it on. I drove to the beach to eat it. When I opened the cup the cheese had hardened and the bacon was a reddish-brown lump. A thick juice had gathered at the top. When I dumped it onto a tortilla, the juice made the tortilla soggy and the whole thing was shaped like the cup. It was plain old DISGUSTING!!!! I only gave it 3 stars because of the dog issue, my to go issue, and #15. If they fixed the cheese and bacon on the #15 I would give it a second chance. They might not want to put it in a cup. And they should fix the dog issue! There was a lady standing next to us in line with her dog and was about to walk in when she saw the no dog sign. She walked away, and by the way she walked, she wasn't a happy camper.  I wish they wouldn't make people take a to go order just because they have dogs! The saying ""dog is a mans best friend"" doesn't apply here. What I also find disturbing and frustrating is that their yelp listing says that they were dog friendly- so why do they have a signs plastered all over their restaurant saying that they're not?! Thats lying to their customers! Dog owners beware!!",3 star rating,Nora W.

5/27/2007,"Los Angeles, CA","I drive from SF to SoCal fairly often and I can't think of the drive without thinking of how much I want to go to La Super Rica.  The freshness and the quality of the ingredients speak for themselves.  This is why there is always a long line - and it 's not just tourists in line.  They definitely have regulars and fans from all walks of life. The tortillas are chewy and thick, freshly made (they have an open kitchen so you can see all the action).  The guacamole (which you shouldn't miss) tends to sell out if you get there later in the day.  In fact, I stopped coming late in the day because they do run out of popular items.  The chilaquiles seem very popular with the regulars though I haven't tried them.  I also like how the place is a shack with a covered patio in the back.  Always makes me feel like I'm on vacation when I'm sitting there sipping on horchata and waiting for my small plates of delicious, hot off the grill Mexican goodies.I recommend that you get the La Super Rica Especial (#16): marinated pork, pasilla pepper, melted cheese on top of three chewy homemade corn tortillas.  Add salsa.  Sooooo good.One thing they could work on: the salsas are quite good but not great.Update:  Recently I had #1, the steak soft tacos.  The steak was a bit tough but the guacamole helped.  I've had quite a few things on their menu and I recommend #16 + the guacamole.  I love their soft, supple corn tortillas which they make from scratch - they're so much better than the corn tortillas you get at other places.",5 star rating,Lolia S.

They haven't remodeled the kitchen since they've opened - one flat top and one grill. The dining room is a framed in concrete slab covered with a tarp. They don't go out of their way to be nice to you. And don't even think about paying with a credit card. Every goddamn ounce of focus is on the food. Plus, Julia Child loved it too.And, I guess, the food. thin-sliced chicken quesadillas, the chunks of chorizo bathed in a warm runny cheese sauce, hot messes of pork with peppers and onions, handmade tortillas, and wait for it, tamales that could kill a man, woman, or child.

I was thinking it was just me, and then realized, the off taste was the orange cheddar cheese. Orange cheddar cheese in my Super Rica was just not tasting right! And the thick, homemade tortillas, were not cooked through which was the least of the issue but worth paying attention to. Bring back the Mexican queso!",1 star rating,Margaret B.

It had a light, cooked- to perfection- breading / outer layer.  Sauce was outstanding.  On this entrée, buyer beware if you are ""heat averse."" I didn't read the description carefully to see that one of the vegetables was a medium to hot pepper so it was spicier than expected, but it was good.The coffee with cinnamon was highly presweetened  and the coffee was not a strong brew .I am not sure if this is how the drink is supposed to be but for me,  the coffee was not drinkable due to excessive sweetness.The watermelon cold drink was terrific.We will definitely return.",5 star rating,Ruth I.

4/7/2013,"New York, NY","La Super Rica seems to be the most talked-about taqueria in Santa Barbara; whether that talk is positive is a different story.  Some say it is worth the wait.  Some say it's good but you can do better.  Some say it's terrible.  What cannot be disputed is that most people know about it, and that the reviews skew positively.  It is a brighly colored white shack with teal trim, and a line that stretches out the door.  Inside there is a fair amount of seating at basic wooden tables with white chairs.  Service is relatively fast (for Cali at least) as well as friendly, so the line should move fast--except when someone makes a huge order.  Everything--including the tortillas-is made fresh, and the prices are only a little north of what you typically see at taquerias.  Controversy aside, I like the damn place a lot.La Super Rica was so good the first time I went, that I came back a second time before my flight back home.  During those 2 visits, I tried the following with overlap: tacos con chorizo, rajas, tacos con bistec, alamore de pechuga, huarache and guacamole.  First off, the homemade tortillas are heavenly; they almost make the restaurant right there.  But there is no doubting the quality of the ingredients used here.  The only issue lies in how they are used sometimes.  The standouts were the rajas in particular.  Maybe it was the seasoning they used, but this combo of cheese and peppers was addictive; combine it with a meat, and you're golden.  The alamore de pechuga/chicken came with peppers and onions, and worked perfectly on the tacos.  The chorizo was greasy and lightly fried in its own fat from its time on the grill, but not as spicy as I would've liked.  Similarly, the tacos con bistec were good but the steak tasted a bit plain compared to other dishes.  The guacamole was great the first time I had it, and just good the second time.  Their salsa bar has 3 salsas: one red, one green and one that is just chopped onions, tomatoes and peppers with cilantro.  Go with the latter, as it is fresh and tasty whereas the other 2 were very muted in their flavors.  The huarache was the best I've had, bar none.La Super-Rica is certainly uneven at times, but the hits outweight the misses for me.  It stacks up pretty well again the taquerias I've visited in the Bronx, some of which suffer from the same inconsistency problems.  That's the issue when Grandma is cooking sometimes.  A pinch of this or that doesn't add up to a consistent recipe and product.  That aside, I'd definitely recommend this place so long as the line isn't too ridiculous.",4 star rating,Justin L.
12/30/2015,"Santa Maria, CA","After seeing the reviews and noticing the line out the door, I knew I had to try this little hole-in-the wall. Well I was totally disappointed. The line moved extremely slow taking us an hour to wait in line. The dining room was just an outdoor patio with plastic patio chairs. The #1 bistec taco was dry and flavorless. Thankfully the handmade corn tortillas saved them from being a castophy. Also had a vegetable tamale that was an uneventful special of the day. Bad part was that it had a sharp piece of white plastic inside it. My husband's tamale also had a piece in it. The guy at the window was very sorry and gave us a replacement tamale. On top of that, they didn't advertise the price of the specials and we were surprised that our bill for 5 people was $56.

Boy do I wish we had a place like this on the east coast! All specials I tried were fantastic. Each something ""different"" from the typical Mexican as described by the person taking orders. The especiale (I believe #16) was excellent. Guacamole super fresh. Taco's and tortilla's perfectly cooked and seasoned. They ran out of the spicy bean filling for the gordita, so he offered to fill it with cheese. Was unbelievable. If they have chilaquiles on the special menu - GET IT!! Trust me - my favorite dish.

I suggest ordering 2-3 menu items to fill you up.  Even with that my husband and I ate for $20!

6/9/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Born and bred, 2nd gen, East LA/San Gabriel Valley couple on romantic weekend in SB, so we decided to check out what all the hubbub was all about!!!  Here's the deal.  Yes, I'd call this la super ""gringo"" tacqueria, but the food was curious enough that we plan to come back and try again next time we are in Santa Barbara.For me, what popped out was the VARIETY of menu choices for such a small place.  Including some stuff I've never heard of, packaged with some random mexican comfort foods we all know and love.  To me, that's what separates this place.  Your typical corner LA or socal tacqueria?  Well, you can only order two ways (ie. taco or burritto) and choices are  Asada, al pastor, pollo...maybe lengua, buche, cabeza, that's it.  Here, you have maybe have 20-30 menu items to choose from in addition to tacos.  They also serve beer (ie. Dos Equis, Corona, Modelo, Pacifico)!  In reality, this is decent small restaurant operating as a taco stand, and that's how you should look at this place.  The prices reflect that, but not that expensive at all.  They have some unique menu items, and personally I'd go for the Specials to get your experience.  As far as tacos, they were bland.  My bf had the Asada, Abodabo, and Al pastor.  Honestly, he prefers a run of the mill Tacqueria de Anda or King Taco over this.  The taco's weren't as greasy as he expected (lol...a good thing), and the cuts of meat were a little larger which is usually indicative of good quality meat.  The tortillas were fresh and hand made (woman was FAST), another sign of quality and a big thumbs up from me.  But it always comes down to how you marinade the meat, how flavorful the meat is, which generally should be salty and citrusy in all it's wonderful forms, and this had no pop whatsoever.  Ideally, a VERY good taco can be eaten by itself.  No salsa or onions/cilantro needed actually... if a taco is REALLY that good.  Best Mexican food ever?  No.  Just different.  It's obvious when looking at some of dishes coming out, that owner came from region of Mexico that was different than my parents.  The Specials, in particular, looked really tasty, and I want to try, or at least make up my mind next time I come back again.  Overall, it's a nice family operation that's well run, and all the employees seemed nice.  If I lived in Santa Barbara, this would probably be one of my favorite places to grab Mexican food Plus handmade tortillas!!! ALWAYS A PLUS!!!!!.",4 star rating,mavel r.

2/21/2017,"Santa Cruz, CA","This place has a tiny kitchen, but still they manage to fit one person to just make tortillas, one person to just cook meat and roast peppers, one person to just take orders, money and get water / drinks, one person just to assemble the orders and one person to get the various odd order stuff.  We always found a line out the door, but it moved quickly. There tacos are more similar to other taquerias, while there specials are not as recognizable. They are delicious and unusual. For example, the cheese and bacon was a bowl of melted cheese and bacon with tortillas on the side. The chile relleno de queso con crema actually is a normal chile relleno in a warm cream sauce.  The chiles are mild in the winter (perfect for me).  I don't know hot spicy they get in late summer.",5 star rating,Bryan S.

I've had better Mexican food served out of taco carts and trucks. I'm dead serious. I've grown up with real Mexican food all my life and I'm always searching for a great taco place that I can frequent. This is not the place. It's okay but nothing to write home about, yet alone put on TV. I had a couple of the tacos, including the carne asada and adobada, and a chile con queso which seemed like it really wanted to be a chile relleno. I love a good chile relleno but the white sauce thing I'd never seen, and it totally didn't work. All our food was lackluster, except the fresh guacamole. But I can get that anywhere.

Supermarket-purchased tortillas ain't no comparison to these ones, which have less artificial flavors and are more...soggy in texture. I have long been blinded by Americanized Mexican food I guess. Upon piling some grilled tri-tip and bell pepper bacon on top, you'd better eat it fast along with all that greasy goodness! Otherwise, you get depressed like me seeing it gradually coagulates. Then again, I'm just that frantic health chic. Most guys really love the meat.Them CHORIZO are good sausages. Little spicy, little overwhelming for a brunch stomach, but...must try.There's also yummy watermelon juice with watermelon cubes, pretty sure they add tons of sugar to it, and contrary to popular belief, it's not thirst-quenching but the exact opposite. Be careful.Like every other person in line, we came as tourists to SB while making a mandatory stop at La Super-Rica. And like every other person, we disliked how long it took to get our food (40mins; we were among the first few parties in line too).

I did not like the taste of their tacos. I have never had a tamale; theirs might be good... I like lots of cheese, but overall, I am from ""okay"" to ""I didn't like it"". And out of what we ordered, I only like the adobado. Their beef and chicken were dry! Their onion and green pepper that go with the food were tasteless. So, yes, their food we mostly ordered except for the tamales and marinated pork lacked of flavour! OMG! I am not at all satisfied w/ my craving for a Mexican food. Hated their tacos, yucks!

Like me, they probably followed some ""What to do in ..."" article and ended up here.5 minutes later I find ""Tacos - El Sabor de mi Tierra"". I walk inside and the smell of delicious Mexican fare almost makes me want to return to Mexico City (almost).I was greeted by Alvaro (the owner) and after telling him I was visiting from Miami, he quickly brought over samples of other tacos while I waited for my order to be made.These were easily the best tacos I've ever eaten outside of Mexico (and only because he didn't have cochinita pibil that day), There was NO WAIT and most importantly, it was authentic Mexican food.Unfortunately, Alvaro doesn't post an address on his business cards but he does list a phone number.

Yes, yes, and more yes! I honestly feel like there are great options for anyone who loves authentic, yummy Mexican food.My favorites are the specials! The vegetable tamale is to die for. I'm not sure if I just get lucky every time, or if it's actually an everyday ""special,"" but I order it each time I come and I think it's absolutely perfect. Another of my favorites is the Chile Relleno which is filled with tons and tons of cheese and grilled veggies. I'm not sure if it's the sauce or the batter, but it contains a spice I can't really put my finger on but it tastes soooooo gooooood! Everything here is so flavorful and when I'm not eating it, I'm thinking about it and wishing that I was.I definitely think this is a place to hit whether you're a resident or just visiting.

5/7/2013,"Santa Ana, CA","I heard about La Super-Rica years ago in Sunset Mag and had always wanted to stop by being a Central Coast gal, so driving back from Arroyo Grande this weekend was my big opportunity...The line was not too bad, it just seemed to build up our anticipation in devouring these fresh tacos and besides it's fun to ask other chowhounds in line what they get. They make the tortillas from scratch in front of you wth a tortilla press.  The staff is super nice and ready to answer your questions. Do yourself a favor, if you're more adventurous like me.  Skip the first 3 items on the menu because they're pretty standard like beef, chicken and pork and go for anything lower on the list like chilaquiles, tri tip.   I got a small guaco for the side to slather onto my # 7. To temper any possible heat order an aqua fresca with fresh chunkies of sweet watermelon!  !ay chihuaha, i'm, comin back!",4 star rating,Lili K.
5/3/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is my favorite taco stand. In. The. World. I've had alot of tacos, but I've come to crave certain dishes here, like the rajas, sauteed pasilla chiles with melted cheese and herbs, and slow cooked onions on freshly made corn tortillas, and the #16 which is grilled chiles and cheese together on fresh handmade tortillas. They know what they are doing here, they keep it simple and nothing changes except for the fresh turquoise paint in this old Orange Julius on Milpas.The salsas are just how I like them, the proportions are just right and not too overwhelming, I don't give out 5 stars very often but this place deserves it. Ive probably been here 100 times and its been good every single time.",5 star rating,Tracy B.

Don't come hungry...you'll become hungry waiting in line.  Be sure to order more than one item, because everything is muy chiquita portions. Frijoles de sopa are great...but be careful of the salsa.

1/16/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","Now I understand why this place was a favorite of Julia Childs. Probably one of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything is made fresh and be sure to get there early as their special of the days do run out quick. I managed to check out this place twice during my two day stay in Santa Barbara.Unfortunately, the first time I was here, I didn't know about the special and the last time I dropped by, around 8pm-ish, they had run out of the specials. Kinda sucks but oh well. All the more reason to come back when I'm in the SB area.If you're going to come, expect to see a line during the opening hours and well into lunch. The lines seemingly get short as the day progresses. I'm sure this has something to do with their specials.During my two trips. I tried pretty much all of their tacos, and they're all fantastic especially on their home made tortillas. If you're in the area, be sure to check this place out.",4 star rating,Toa B.
2/18/2018,"Desert Hot Springs, CA","Worth the wait and the difficult parking for our truck. GreAt tacos, both steak and chicken. The homemade tortillas were so good but are they only corn?

2/14/2018,"Sunnyside, NY",I love this place. They do a bowl with half rice half beans... I could eat that with a little avocado on top and a couple of their handmade tortillas everyday!

6/9/2016,"Wilmington, CA",I'm very critical when it comes to Mexican food.  We were stuck in traffic so I Yelp for the nearest Mexican restaurant and La Super-Rica Taqueria came up.  Upon researching the reviews and pictures I decided to give it a try. As we arrived we had a hard time finding parking but it was no turning back. The menu items are very detailed and the price are reasonable.  I picked #16 and it was worth it. I love how the chile pasilla complimented the marinated pork. We all enjoyed our meal and who doesn't love homemade tortillas. I will definitely coming back again when I'm in town.,5 star rating,Yvonne P.
5/1/2015,"Jersey City, NJ","Stopped in here after heading back to LA from a bit of road trip.  Got really good reviews and was visited by Adam Richman...and found out thru yelpers that this was a place that Julia Child frequented.  Cash only, food is pretty reasonable but make sure you have enough bc there are alot of options.We tried: tacos al pastor, chicken tacos, chile con queso and guac.Tacos al pastor- a good amount of meat and really good tortillas.  that is it, you need to add the salsa to it if you want moreChicken tacos- grilled chicken with lots of cheese--pretty goodChile con queso- grilled peppers/chiles with lots of cheese in tortillas---almost didn't get this one and it was by far my favGuacamole- a really big portion that was added to most of the tacos and still had plenty of leftovers to eat with the torillas.Each order came with two tacos, and for guac it came with two tortillas.Total dive of a place but pretty quick even with the little line that was outside.  Food was made to order and you saw them cooking it in the open kitchen.Can't wait to go back once I am in Santa Barbara again.  Check out @onebiteonesip on ig for picture",4 star rating,Jackie F.
3/7/2010,"Carlsbad, CA","I'll travel miles for homemade tortillas.  I'll travel miles for good meat.  This place is worth the ride.I've been here about 6 times, and I've always been impressed.  This place is a true gem, the purest definition of a great hole-in-the-wall.The selection of tacos is very unique.  Not only chicken, beef, and pork are produced here, but many cheese and chile based concoctions adorn the menu.  This is what I love the best.  We ordered two types of beef tacos, chorizo-cheese tacos, and the chicken sopes special.  These are unquestionably some of the most sumptuous tacos in California (Baja or Alta).The sopes were the day's special.  The masa was fried perfectly with a thin crust that stood up to the chicken, cheese, and salsas.  The salsa had a slightly dark color, and had a nice smoke flavor with a nice ""tang"" underneath.  They never stood a chance.The ""regular"" tacos are crazy delicious.  They are all framed by a freshly pressed corn tortilla and can make any dish excellent.  Even so, the fillings are something to write home about: I had a chorizo-cheese and a pasilla-cheese taco and they are so rich.I topped it off with a horchata and me and the missus returned back to San Diego with smiles on our faces and bellies full of comfort.",5 star rating,Parris B.
9/16/2015,"Tustin, CA","I have eaten at this restaurant in the past on recommendation from Sunset magazine, but never again after this weekend's lunch.  The beans and rice were weak examples of these Mexican delicacies.  There was no grated cheese or sour cream to be found on the premises.  When I ordered the chili verdura, it came in a soupy broth.  I had to pour this off before I could even entertain eating this.  The carne asada tacos were just that, carne and nothing else.  Even the street taco guys give you salsa, cilantro and onion.  I will not be going back.",1 star rating,Virginia T.

3/21/2013,"Baltimore, MD","Excellent!  No wonder Julia Child was a loyal customer!  The most striking qualities were the freshness of ingredients and distinctiveness of individual flavors.  I had the #16, the Super-Rica Especial.  It consisted of roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese, marinated pork, and three homemade tortillas.  The flavor characteristics reminded me of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in NYC -- not overwhelming with heat, full of flavor and deliciousness.  I also tried some of the watermelon Agua Fresca my gf ordered - wow!  It was the best Agua Fresca I've ever tasted. Bright, clean, crisp, refreshing watermelon flavor that leapt out of the glass!  Wish I had ordered one for myself instead of a can of Coke.The price was on par with what I would expect for a taqueria.  The portions seemed a bit small, although it may be because the food was so good that I just wanted more.  I look forward to returning someday to try more of the menu items.",5 star rating,Steven B.

Had high expectations for the food and was kinda of disappointed. When we arrived the line was out the door which we waited about an hour just finally get to the window to place our order.  Then once I placed my ordered, I still waited 30 mins more to wait for my food....by this time we were starving! We ordered tacos, but there were not prepared like your typical tj style tacos. Its just handmade tortillas and the meat is overloaded-by its self.  They have a tiny salsa bar that you can serve on your tacos, (mild/med green/red hot salsa) but that's about it.Other than that, there is really nothing that spectular about this place considering the amount of waiting we had to invest to get our food.  The place has a few tables, based on first come first serve basis, the roof in the sitting area is a plastic covering-nothing elegant, very old and humble place.  The owners/employees, not your typical friendly/welcoming business.  Honestly, I've been to better hole in wall mexican food spots, this place is ok-ay the food is decent, but its  nothing to rave about....however,  I wouldnt come back again.",3 star rating,Mari G.

I also had the Lomito Suiza, which is a pork taco made in their special way. Yes, the wait is long, both before you order and after, but the service is good and worth the wait.

Did I order the wrong thing? I'm just glad the line wasn't super long the day we went.My family and I went there and between the three of us we got several items. A variety of tacos, a quesadilla, enchiladas and the cheese and bacon thing. We all thought the tacos were flavorless. Chorizo, carne asada, pork, it didn't matter - they were all really bland. I don't need a lot of frill on my tacos but something more than unseasoned meat would be nice. The tortillas were decent though. The cheese and bacon thing was literally a glop of cheese and I swear there were pieces of hot dog, not bacon. I was expecting it to be like a queso dip but it was just a sad hunk of mushy cheese. The enchiladas were the exception. Those were delicious. They were a special and the best thing we had by far, wish we'd ordered more of those instead of the tacos. I'll give it one star for the unique atmosphere of the place itself (I love a dive) and one star for the enchiladas.There is much better Mexican food in SB than this place.

My friends were vegetarian and it seemed like their options were more limited and just okay. Seems like this place is more so for meat eaters not grazers.

7/29/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","What a cute little restaurant with a large outdoor patio for seating. We arrived 20 minutes before the restaurant opened. By 11:00AM, there was a line outside and around the corner. Glad we were the 2nd,  3rd, 4th, and 5th in line. What did we order...we ordered some tacos, the quesadillas, and some chile rellenos. To describe the food, it is fresh, flavorful, delicate, and definitely gourmet. The prices are reasonable and comparable to the other taqueria a few blocks over. This was a surprise to me, because the food quality is much better and less greasy at La Super Rica Taqueria than the other taquerias a few blocks away. The tortillas are hand-made right in front of you. You can ask them to cook them a little longer. The chorizo is homemade because I saw the cook pull a handful of it from a container before plopping it on the grill. The marinated pork was light, not greasy, and it had a hint of smokiness. The chile rellenos can't get any fresher especially when the entire bin of chiles are sitting in the kitchen right in front of you to see that they are indeed fresh. Unfortunately I can't say much for their salsas because it was basic. I can imagine that if additional attention was made to upscale the salsa, it would elevate the flavors of the tacos even more. In all, La Super Rica Taqueria is a must for a Foodie in search of real ethnic food far from the commercialize State Street. It's outdoor covered patio seating only with a few limited tables indoors. The lines are always long. The prices range from $2.50 to $12. It's paper plate and plastic forks so don't expect any servers. A ""must go to"" if you are in town. It's great simple food at it's best!!!",5 star rating,Sunny D.

I'm there. However, after ordering a couple tacos, drinks, and a tamale, our total shot up to almost $30. WTF?! We were shocked to find such prices at a beat-down taco shack. We failed to look clearly at the prices because we assumed everything to be inexpensive, and to this day we still can't figure out what sent our bill soaring. Anyway...The tacos de chorizo were probably the best ones we tried. The sausage was nicely spicy and the homemade tortillas were soft and fluffy. The tacos de bistec and tacos de adobado were both whatever; the meat in both was kind of dry. The shredded beef tacos on their specials menu was pretty solid. The beef was tender and topped with a creamy avocado sauce. We also tried the watermelon agua fresca and the horchata. Tooooo sweet. After diluting them with much water, they tasted a lot more bearable and my toothache went away. Warning #1: Don't order the tamales (they were on the specials menu so I don't know if they are a permanent menu fixture or not). First of all, they looked gross. To describe them briefly, they were a flattish lump drizzled with dark brown sauce which resulted in a barf-like mixture. Taste-wise, it was oddly sweet, which was a rude awakening. I think I ranted about how much I hate sweet/salty ambiguity in a previous review haha. BLEGH. Warning #2: The salsa has jalapenos galore. If you are iffy about really spicy food, stay away (or spend some time picking the little green chunks out). All in all, the food here was just okay. The prices were cheap, but not dirt cheap as the shack-like accommodations suggested. I'm not so sure it deserves its renown.",2 star rating,Paulina Y.

My parents took me here when I was a kid - at this point in my life I only ate bean and cheese burritos - and I was so sad that there were no flour tortillas. Now flash forward, and today I think La-Super Rica is the best Mexican spot in California. Yum yum yum. In May, my boyfriend and I took a trip up to Hearst Castle and stopped here on the way up...and on the way back. I told him, ""You have GOT to try this place."" Having never ordered chorizo before, he went with the #10 - chorizo quesadilla, and he was in HEAVEN. On the way home he ordered three more. In addition, we have also tried #12, 8, 18 (guacamole - amazing), and 20. #20 is the only thing I don't care for. Everything else is great!As others have said, be prepared for a serious line because it was Julia Child's favorite Mexican spot. This is no secret.

2/24/2013,"Irvine, CA","We were originally planning to eat at Los Agaves, but it was too crowded for our taste on a saturday night.  Luckily, there was a great alternative a few steps away!  The friends that I were with had already been here once and said it was an ok place. With that strong recommendation, we made our way over there.  To me, it's usually a good sign when there's a line out the door so I was excited to try it out.  The menu is a large blackboard (yes, the ones that use chalk) that had about 20 different options from quesidillas to tacos to soups.  I got their chorizo quesidilla and marinated pork tacos with some guacamole.  And of course horchata.  Everything I ate was delicious.  It's not that gourmet, Americanized, super-sized Mexican cuisine.. it's small home made tortillas with fresh ingredients. It was inexpensive and delicious.  Glad that we tried it out and I'd definitely come back to this taco shack.",3 star rating,Theresa V.

2/25/2011,"Honolulu, HI","My cousin recommended that we try this place while on our visit to Santa Barbara, and the Yelpers seemed to like it too, so we stopped by for a late dinner (8:30 pm).  Because it was a stormy evening, we had no trouble finding parking, and the restaurant only had a few customers.  Awesome!  The grill is directly behind the ordering window, so you can see them prepare your food.  Best part is that that they make their tortillas fresh and made-to-order, right in front of your eyes.  Here's what we ordered:#8: Alambre de Pechuga (grilled chicken breast with bell pepper, onions and mushrooms and 3 tortillas - $5.80.  The grilled chicken and veggies were piled high on top of the 3 tortillas.  We did not have a clue on how to eat it, so we just used our fork and knives.  We tried to be discreet, because if the employees saw us eating it this way, they probably would have kicked us out, or died from laughing so hard.  It was soooo good - it tasted fresh, it was hot, and a lot for $5,80. #1: Tacos de Bistec (tender strips of grilled steak served on two homemade tortillas - $2.50.  I could not believe how much meat they gave for the price.  The meat was flavorful and the tortillas were soft.  I wish we could get great Mexican food like this in Hawaii.",5 star rating,Nat N.

5/28/2011,"Redwood City, CA","Good solid tacos. You watch them make the corn tortillas, and they load the tacos up with fine grilled meat, or if you order any cheesy things, they serve the melted cheese with meat in a bowl with the tortillas on the side.If you want any kick in the tacos, you can load them up with the red sauce, green sauce or pico de gallo. I'd recommend doing it to deal with the extremely gooey cheesiness of anything with cheese.This place is good in the quality and freshness of the food, and the simplicity of the tacos bring that out. The line is quite long though, but Santa Barbara is such a chill place a little waiting shouldn't matter. One thing that bothers me was the number of flies in the dining area.

9/24/2012,"Hancock Park, CA","Would you ask your 100 year old great grandmother if she could recommend a legit authentic taco stand?  Probably not, even if she was Mexican.  Famous foodie Julia Child would be 100 years old this year if she were still alive today and she's the reason why you're going out of your way for this place, standing on such a long line.  This place may have been the bomb when Ms. Child was loco for it, but those days seem to have passed just like Ms. Child who checked out eight years ago to the big taco stand in the sky.The place is decent, just not great... and when a decent place is hyped to be great the disappointment feels worse.First you stand on a long line waiting to put in your order.  Then you wait for your order number to be called when you will retrieve your food from the pick up window.  Last Sunday at lunch, the whole process took about 30 minutes from ordering to food pick-up... which actually was faster than the other two times during the past 20 years I've tried out this place.Here's what we had:#2 Tacos de Castilla: Grilled Top Round... flavor free.#3 Tacos de Chuleta: Grilled Pork... flavor free.#6 Rajas: chile pasilla, onions, cheese with tortillas... texture/taste was a gloppy mess.#7 Alambre de filete: grilled tri tip, bacon, bell peppers, onions with tortillas... pretty good!#11 Lomito Suizo: grilled marinated pork, cheese between tortillas... best of what we ordered.#14 Chorizo special: chorizo & cheese with tortillas.  Pretty tasty.I'd recommend the #7, #11, #14 as above average.  The corn tortillas are hand made and you can taste the difference.  The tortillas are the star here... too bad the fillings weren't amazing... and the tacos with just meat and no cheese were tasteless and should be avoided.Horchata was good.  Choice of three salsas at the salsa bar were unimpressive.Every decade or so I give this place another try... and I always end up wondering... why did I bother?  Oh yea, Julia Child, that's why.",3 star rating,Spike T.

Not bad for the price.However, the food. Eh. The carne asada or steak was really dry and flavorless.....the tortillas were good but not mind-blowing amazing. The pork was so-so, at least it had good flavor. The guac was my favorite. It was so creamy and delicious. Kind of a small amount for $3 but I guess everything's pretty small and cheap there.

It was full of tourists passing through, but that's about it.There wasn't much flavor to the steak taco, it didn't stand on the meat alone and needed lots of sauce.

8/7/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","La Super-Rica is pretty different than most taquerias I've been to, so I'm judging it by different criteria than at a typical taqueria or taco truck in LA. It's very California-influenced ""fresh Mex"", in that it really emphasizes the freshness of its ingredients and you can taste it in every bite. I love that the guacamole actually tastes like ripe avocados, and that whether it's the tomatoes in the pico de gallo or the grilled chile pasillas, all the vegetables are chopped coarsely into big meaty chunks. As far as the meat, the taste comes from the meat itself rather than the seasoning, and the cheese is also very fresh and bursting with flavor.I got here as soon as it opened, so I didn't have to wait, but already there was a line starting to form soon after I got here. It's not cheap, but the quality and freshness is totally worth it, and it actually ends up feeling more filling than it looks.",4 star rating,Steve J.

I even saw a couple getting dropped off in a taxi, as if this were a destination point.  Stop the madness! The Emperor has no clothes!This place is mediocre at best.  We ordered  the carne asada tacos,  2 different pork tacos, chorizo tacos, the  tri-tip plate and one more dish. The chorizo tacos were good. Everything else very average at best.  The meat was dry and bland and the tri-tip was chewy.   The salsa bar was tiny and just ok.  Not bad but nothing special at all.  The owners must be looking out the glass kitchen window and wondering what all these crazy gringos are doing!  They hit pay dirt and have no clue why.   BTW, there wasn't a single Hispanic customer in there which is usually a very good tell of how good the food is to a native person. I have only myself to blame.  I came here once before and didn't want to believe my own original judgement.  I was convinced I had missed something.  Now I know better.

Full of upper middle class white people.  There were no minorities here, which is odd given the neighborhood.  Still, the food was good but not great!  I think for Mexican you can get better food in the area. Actually, after we left we went to another Mexican restaurant down the street and ate again. Prices are a cheap, but I think a little higher because of the patrons.We order several items.  Nothing memorable or exciting.  What do you expect from a place with lawn furniture and pick nick tables for furniture.I would definitely return but Super-Rica Taqueria wouldn't be my first choice.",3 star rating,Pierre C.

We got a bunch of items and it was all meh. We are still confused why people wait in line. Their tortillas are medium good but fresh which is nice. Dry tacos and bland all around.

Their is always a wait, bits it is so worth it!!! The tortillas are made from scratch. If you come in as a group I would recommend that as the group orders have one person get a table as it can get pretty busy in here. This place reminds me of small taco shops in Tijuana México.

We came early and did not wait long but I can't imagine wasting ones time in an hour long line for just ok cheap food. The meats were on the dry side. I liked the house made tortillas. My favorite dish had grilled and blackened chili rellenos over chicken and cheese. The horchata was very sweet with some cinnamon in it..Not really worth a special trip unless you want to see what Julia Child's favorite taqueria is like.",3 star rating,G N.

5/1/2013,"San Ramon, CA","There's a lot to like with Super Rica.  The tortillas are made there, so they're fresh and pretty darn tasty.  The service is friendly and they move quickly to get your food out asap.  Once you see how they pack 9 employees in a small box to make that happen, you become a bit more appreciative.  They also have a huge variety of meats and cuts.  It can be overwhelming for patrons used to Chipotles ""beef, steak or pork"" options.  But any taqueria that offers different cuts of beef along with chorizo and tri tip is legit in my book.Ultimately, I felt the tacos were just ok.  You simply get meat on top of a tortilla, and it's up to you to get imaginitive with the toppings.  A few of the cuts I had were a bit overcooked and dry, and the overall meal left me satisfied but not quite blown away with a meal of tortillas and meat.  Barbaric?  Yes.  Blown away? Not really.",3 star rating,Philip N.
3/28/2015,"Fullerton, CA","Went here on a recent Spring Break trip and it is even better than the reviews tout.  I thought I knew good Mexican food until I came to this little hole in the wall joint.  This humble place had incandescent food!  We ordered the specials, the veggie chile relleno, the asada tacos, the beans and the sopes.  Although the beans were soupy, cooked beautifully, they were a little wan and under-seasoned and I wouldn't order those again though it's clearly a customer favorite.  I would, however, order every single other thing on the menu.  Everything was fresh, beautifully-prepared, savory, and tasted clean and honest.  I don't know if that's a good enough description, but I wanted to come here every single meal for every single day.  When I hopped on to yelp to write a review and discovered that Julia Childs loved this place, my heart sang.  Of course she did, it's scrumptious.",5 star rating,Irene P.

3/18/2012,"Pasadena, CA","FINALLY got around to trying this gem of a hole-in-the-wall!  After living in Santa Barbara for three years, we thought it was about time to try the coveted ""Julia Child's favorite Mexican restaurant.""  We went for the #2 (steak tacos), #16 (the special with marinated pork, cheese, and grilled peppers), and #18? (guacamole and two tortillas).  We loaded up on the fresh salsas and eagerly awaited our order.  There was plenty of seating (specifically, lawn furniture) in the semi-covered patio.  We were there at around 4:00, so it wasn't too busy.When we got our food, we couldn't wait to dig in.  The #16 is definitely not overrated.  SO tasty.  LOVED the peppers.  Would definitely order it again.  The homemade tortillas and the guacamole were certainly tasty.  I loved that we could literally watch our tortillas being made from scratch as we waited in line.  The steak was pretty good in the steak tacos, but we'd probably try something different next time.  The salsas made everything taste better.  And we got a generous-sized cup of water, which is a lot better than those mini cups that most places give you, to make you feel bad for not buying a beverage.The whole meal for me and my boyfriend was $13 - quite the deal!   And the cashier was friendly, and they bussed the tables in a timely manner.  This place is definitely worth trying.",4 star rating,Jenna C.

This is Slow Food, not fast food.  Everything you order will be made from scratch as you watch.  Plan on waiting in line at least 20 minutes, and another 20 minutes for your food.  Even in the pouring rain, there will be a line down the sidewalk.And you'll see why.",5 star rating,Jamey F.

11/13/2014,"Simi Valley, CA","I am by no means a Mexican food snob, but I really liked this place. The line was there, as forewarned by yelp reviewers, but it gave me time to scan their sizable menu, and it took less than 10 minutes. It is indeed cash only, and the drinks are bottled or canned, but that's the kind of establishment this is, and they have openly accessible recycling receptacles (awesome). I ordered #8, Alambre de Pechuga, one of the chicken dishes, and I was very pleased. It had a perfect amount of spice, the veg was perfectly sautéed, crisp and flavorful. The tables were clean (I shared one with 3 other gentlemen because it was quite busy, but it was nice to talk to some strangers). Their salsa was nicely prepared, though the placement right at the pickup window seemed slightly ill-advised. Still delicious, though! Definitely a recommendation!

8/26/2016,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA","This place has a high rating do to the fact that it's probably being rated by a lot of Caucasians (apologies if I offended someone). Is it authentic? Yes, tortillas made by hand ( can't get anymore authentic than that), legit meats and plates. But if your going to serve a Taco the least you can do is serve it with cilantro and onions ( they do not serve it with either of those items ), it's the most basic ingredients for a taco. The Bistec tacos are dry and the meat has no flavor what's so ever. The chorizo quesadilla is not even Mexican chorizo, it's sausage and chopped. As a real Mexican I have never had it served that way (I'll provide my email so anyone can rebuttal me on the chorizo and this review at the end). Now what I will rave about is their Tamal Norteño, this dish is the only thing that made my visit worth it. The Puerco meat in the Tamal norteño is really flavorful and not that spicy, so anyone can enjoy. They serve aguas frescas ( beverages made from fruit ), or so they say. The Horchata water is made from the fake powdered mix, same thing goes with their agua de Jaimaca. They provide four types of salsas, red, green, pico de gallo, and forgive but I did not have the fourth one so I do not recall what it was. The red salsa has decent flavor, the green one is so plain I swear it's the pre made one from your local Mexican grocery (which usually are made in high volume and their is no detail in how it's made). Obviously I'm only writing about the items I had on the day I visited this place, so maybe the other dishes save this place. But I repeat if your a Mexican spot and mess up on the most simple dish/item TACOS I have lost all faith in you! Acruz8506@gmail.com I welcome your reply to my review.",2 star rating,Julian C.

7/26/2012,"Garden Grove, CA","Different than what you are expecting.... This is not mexican-from-a-restaurant style mexican food. The ""combos"" listed on the menu board do not come with beans and rice (which is why the food is so inexpensive). Don't forget to check out the Daily Specials board - if you don't look for it, you will miss it (my mom never even saw it). Wait in line, order at the counter, try to find a table in the covered porch in the back, and someone will call your number when your food is ready. Everything comes on styrofoam plates and the silverware is plastic. Here's what we ordered:#6 with green chile - it was good, greasy, and cheesy - but, basically, it's roasted green peppers put on a grill, covered with cheese, mixed up, and then put on a corn tortillaQuesadilla - typical, but made with corn tortillas (so you can imagine, it's tiny)Rice - smoky (or something), personally, I didn't care for it, but it is something different#13 ? - the cheese and tomato sauce plate with three corn tortillas - basically this was a bowl with tomato sauce and some melted cheese in the middle - - tortillas come on the side. My mom ate this and said that it was very good, but it honestly looked like cheese soup with tomatoes in itVegetable tamale - of everything I tried here, this was good and definitely the best value for the moneyThis cost $18.We waited in line for probably at least 20 minutes, maybe more.I would say that this place is probably GREAT at 1:30am (lol), but it's not worth a 30 or 40 minute wait (from the time you get in line to the time you get your food) during the middle of the day. I would have preferred to go to a regular Mexican restaurant for the time and money spent here. However, if there was a much, much, much shorter line, I would be happy to order something for a small snack, I just don't think the food is good enough to warrant that type of wait.",3 star rating,Carla Lee H.

9/2/2012,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA","I saw a line and stood at the end of it. That's basically how I found out about this place. I live in LA and one weekend I was kinda feeling adventurous so I decided to spend a day wandering around Santa Barbara. I looked up some Yelp reviews and decided to check out a place called Los Agaves. I got there and ordered this dish called Molcajete because one of the reviewers recommended it. When I got it, I was like WTH? Is this some kind of soup? And why would they give tortilla with it? Everything falls out when I try to take a bite because it's too liquidy. Anyway, I felt like an idiot so I got that in a container to go. But while I was looking for parking, I remember seeing a line coming out of this shack (turns out to be La Super-Rica Taqueria) since it was on the same street as Los Agaves. So on my way back to my car I decide to leave my leftover and wait in line to check this place out. I couldn't even see the menu until I was almost at the cash register, but the line went slowly and thankfully I had plenty of time to make a choice by the time it was my turn. I ordered a #6, 7, and 18. #6 Rajas- not bad, the ingredients were creamy and kinda mushy, but still pretty tasty#7 Alambre de Filete- I liked it better than #6; bigger dish, great flavors#18 Guacamole- decent; not the best I had, but still pretty good If I go again, I think I'd try #16. I was on the fence about it while I was there, but I was kinda full from Los Agaves so I decided to pass. Overall it was a fun experience. The prices are reasonable and the tortillas are hand made in front of you.",5 star rating,Anthony C.
3/4/2012,"Somerville, MA","This place was decent.  Not the best tacos or Mexican I have ever had.  I didn't really enjoy the wait and probably wouldn't wait in that long line ever again especially for the smallish portions.  But the food is fresh and they are constantly refilling the salsa station.  I went here based on seeing it on Man Vs. Food. So I followed in the footsteps of the host and got the  La Super-Rica Especial -- roasted poblano stuffed with cheese with marinated pork on top of tortillas.  I washed it all down with the watermelon juice, which was a thick watermelon drink, but moderately enjoyable.  Worth a try once, expect long lines and small portions.  Likely you will have to order more than one thing.  But if you're not super hungry, it is a great place for a snack.  You can get in and out of here pretty cheap as well.",3 star rating,Caesar R.

I always enjoy exchanging pleasantries with the guys taking orders, they are super cool, always friendly (even when the line is around the block) and tell me the gordita is ""very spicy, ok?"" every single time I order it.

5/1/2017,"Chino, CA","I really wanted to love this place. From all the Yelp reviews I expected great food, but I was so disappointed! I waited in line for 30 minutes and was really hungry, so ordered 7 different items. Out of the 7, only 2 were okay. The tamale de mole and the posole had the most flavor. The chicken and steak taco, guacamole, and gordita were lacking flavor. Definitely not worth the wait!",2 star rating,Bob O.
7/14/2012,"Philadelphia, PA","He says: Delicious tacos and sides.  We stopped in on our way driving up the coast to SF, on the recommendation of an old friend who lived in the area.  We started with the Sopes de Pollo from the specials.  This had two awesome qualities: 1. It was delicious.  So good.  2. It was ready immediately.  This was a very desirable quality after a 20 minute wait in line.For my entree, I got the Super-Rica special (#16)- so good.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the chile pasilla dishes.  Also, the tacos were very good in my opinion.  The Horchata was also quite tasty, good to wash things down.  No complaints here, I would entirely return.  In fact, I want to return right now.She says: I second his thoughts. Tacos were all delicious, and the horchata had just the right amount of sweetness.",4 star rating,Benny Y.

8/31/2015,"San Luis Obispo, CA","I have been pretty disappointed my two most recent visits here. The food is excellent, and that is consistent. However, the customer service definitely leaves something to be desired. On my most recent visit, I discovered a small shard of glass in my food, potentially quite dangerous. I brought it to the attention of the cashier (owner?) in a very friendly and discreet way. I was not looking to make a stink about it, but to alert him to the problem so he could address it for the sake of his other customers. I felt like he brushed me off, and he made no effort to make things right. No offer to make me another dish, let alone refund me for the food I was no longer interested in eating. I used to stop at this place every single time I passed through Santa Barbara, but I doubt I'll be back.",1 star rating,Daniel D.

I always order what ever the special is with my favorites being: The Vegetarian Tamale, The Chile Relleno (with white cream sauce), Sopes, Tacos Desebrada, and the Queso de Casquela. I recommend studying the menu ahead of time to know their specials so you can make a point to go on your favorite day. I always choose the Jamaica or Horchata to drink. Super Rica is a unique experience unlike anything else that caters to a world class pallet of flavors. Their sauces are so unique! A Santa Barbara staple!",5 star rating,Caterina C.
10/18/2011,"Los Angeles, CA",I heard so many wonderful things about this joint....and I was not disappointed!!It is best to go with a lot of people so you can try tons of dishes.  We were three and were able to try seven different dishes.  Most of the dishes are really small so it is more like Mexican Tapas.  The food is really heavy and full of cheese.  It is also best to go off hours and on a Monday.  We went at 1pm on a Monday and waited 15minutes.  Well worth the wait...At 2pm when we left the wait was only 5minutes.We tried:The Veg table Tamale- A twist on the tamale it is filled with vegetables and drenched in a cream sauce.  i usually love tamales but this was the dish that I enjoyed the least.  I would not recommend it.  Chicken Tamale- Tiny and delicious.  Do not split this it is only meant for one person.  It is made with moist shredded chicken.  Fresh Guacamole- AMAZING!  one of the better guacamole and well worth $3.  A perfect amount to share among two people who love guacamole. The Freshly made tortillas were also excellent.  Pork Tacos with cheese- The pork was too dry and not tenderChorizo Tacos with cheese- My favorite dish.  The chorizo was well seasoned and had a nice bite.  Paired with the cheese and the ho-made salsa and I was in heavenChicken Tacos with cheese- The Chicken was very flavorful and well seasoned.  Melted cheese and Bacon-  This reminded me of a Bowl of Cheese soup with tons of Bacon.  It was too oily and fatty.  My dad enjoyed it most when he put a few spoonfuls on his corn tortilla and made a taco.  We will definitely go back! Great Joint!,4 star rating,Loic C.
5/12/2017,"Garden City, NY","Loved the feel of the restaurant, very cute place for lunch. The homemade corn/flour tortillas are absolutely delicious as was the guacamole. The downfall was that ordered a dish that was described as being ""chorizo with melted cheese and 3 corn tortillas"" and I got a bowl of melted cheese with a few pieces of chorizo. Aside from that, the normal tacos were good as were the homemade salsas you can opt to put on the side.",3 star rating,Jen N.
3/25/2012,"La Jolla, CA","My boyfriend and I go here all the time. It's amazing. We order the La Superrica Especial (#16) every single time. Make sure you look out for the daily specials. All of the tamales (vegetable, fish) are really good. The plates are way better than the tacos, so unless you're short on cash or not that hungry, don't bother with the tacos. The tortillas are AMAZING. They offer 3 amazing salsas (in order of personal preference): tomatillo, pico de gallo, and salsa roja.Drinks: The horchata is not traditional, but it tastes like heaven. It's a little bit sweet, so let the ice melt a little before you start sipping away. The jamaica is tart, refreshing, and addictive. If you go during the spring/summer, sometimes they have aguas frescas. YOU MUST order one (sharing isn't the best idea in this situation).It's cash only, so make sure you stop by an ATM before you get in line!",5 star rating,Jeniffer L.

I don't know what changed but there's NO WAY any of us returns here again!!!Yesterday we all took the trip up there and stopped by for the first time in years.......just after lunch time...5 of us ordered the regular beef tacos, quesadillas and some other stuff. Everything arrived on these 3 or 4 inch TINY tortillas.....The Beef Tacos consisted of 2 tablespoons of dry tough beef on 2 tortillas AND NOTHING ELSE on it..no cabbage, parsley, lettuce, sauce NOTHING????....they have a small condiment bar...just hot sauce & salsa...we tried that  but they were all terrible....hardly edible!!!  The Quesadilla's were melted cheese on the same tiny tortillas.

There is also a nice range of special items, beyond what is on the fixed menu. Timing is everything if you don't care to wait in line.

3/10/2012,"East Bay, CA","I thought I knew good, traditional Mexican...until that is, I came to Super-Rica.   A local favorite, SR won't appear on any cooking shows or Sunday LA Times articles...it's to too low key for that.     SR did get a major plug by Julia Child however. (That being said, apparently Man v. Food had an episode there recently).But the cuisine should not be missed for it's originality, it's excellence and most importantly it's authenticism.  The tortillas are all homemade, pressed and cranked out with stunning efficiency by a squat little Mexican woman in full view of the long line of waiting Santa Barbarans.   But the tortilla is just a start.    SR's menu of authentic pork, beef and pepper based cuisine is stunning.   Chile Poblano, Relleno, Stuffed with all manner of meats, creams and spices, most of it served an inch of Melted cheese (which, surprisingly does not detract from the core flavours) .   Pretty sinful stuff.    I wouldn't make it a regular habit if you want to keep your cholesterol below 500, but great nevertheless.",4 star rating,Max K.

1/18/2015,"Saratoga, CA","This place lives up to the hype, as long as you know what to order. Our first day, we waited in line outside for 45 minutes in cold winter weather. It was worth the wait. The next day we cancelled our reservations at a fancy local restaurant and came back for dinner.Far and away, the must-order dish is #16, the Super-Rica Especial. Marinated pork, roasted chile pasilla, and melted cheese on a stack of three freshly-grilled corn tortillas. After our first visit here, I learned that simply getting two of these would leave me comfortably full and extremely satisfied. Even as I write this I feel myself getting hungry -- I could eat these for dinner for the next week straight and I wouldn't get tired of them.  On our second visit, a guy who had already finished his food saw us devouring our Super-Rica Especials and asked us what they were. He immediately got back in line and ordered one. Wise decision.My next favorite dish on their regular menu was #11, the Lomito Suizo. It's essentially a corn tortilla quesadilla with the same marinated pork and cheese they use for the Super-Rica Especial. If you don't like chiles but love deliciousness, get this instead of #16.Their daily specials are listed on a separate board. I loved everything we tried off their specials menu, especially the chicken enchiladas and tamales. It's worth noting I normally don't like and almost never order enchiladas or tamales. I'm glad we tried them here.  In general, their food starts out amazingly delicious when it's hot, but steadily declines as it gets colder. (This is most noticeable in the dishes heavy on melted cheese, which become almost inedible once they're cold.) Eat fast. You can always talk to your friends/family after you're done eating.Their horchata and coffee are both delicious. They use cinnamon and a special kind of sugar cane in the coffee, which gives it a very pleasing sweetness. (Think Mexican Coke vs. American Coke.)I recommend staying away from the more ""standard"" dishes like tacos, which are listed in the left column of their main menu. Not their strong suit, and I imagine many of the less enthusiastic reviews are from folks who only ordered these. Get #16 and/or #11, and then supplement as necessary from the specials menu or the right column of the main menu.",5 star rating,Eric P.

We got: La Super Rica especial (roasted chile pasilla w/ cheese and marinated pork), Lomito Suizo (pork and melted cheese between 2 corn tortillas) and the Alambre de Filete (grilled tri-tip w/ onions, peppers and bacon). The meats came out perfectly cooked and delicious, and the sauces and sides were fresh and tasty. We also ordered agua fresca de sandia (watermelon) which was a nice refreshing beverage with chunks of watermelon.Luckily we hit this place up at a lull during the day when the line wasn't completely out of control, and we were able to snag a table for 3 without any wait. The only minor complaint is that after we ordered, our total creeped up to almost $30... which, counting the agua fresca, is about $10/person, but still seemed pricey considering we actually only ordered 3 dishes. It was worth it, admittedly, but for portion and value, I guess I was just not expecting to pay that much. All in all not a deterrent to future visits.",4 star rating,Mike Q.

Completely ignored at the order window till the older guy feels ready to deal with taking your money for the most boring food ever. The inefficient set up and old facilities = worst experience ever.

The meat was chewy.  This place is on par with Casa Blanca on state street but much more affordable. But that says nothing for the taste or quality of the food.

The chorizo quesadillas are amaaaazing as well I went back and ordered two more to go and waited an additional 45 mins.

The carne asada is dry, the adobo and rice were flavorless, the gorditas were forgettable and the salsa is just sad. I even took my parents with me who are from Meheeco and they were like ""Are you mad at us? Why did you take us to this place?""

7/5/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is probably one of the more authentic eateries that we've come across in the area.  They've got a large selection of items available but its done tapas style.  Ordering can quickly lead to an order of 6 items for 2 people and a bill of $30. But hey, its actually pretty worth it.  The tortillas are handmade, the cheese is authentic and isn't the typical orange and white cheese blend you're used to.  It amazed me that a kitchen so small was able to pump out food in such qty and volume. One of the things that made this place an experience was the menu.  If you're not good at deciding, try to get a glance at the menu or a picture of it while you're in line.  Usually, you don't see it until you're on deck for ordering @ the register and trying to make up your mind with 2 or 3 items that seem familiar can throw you.",4 star rating,Mike N.

You think you've got what it takes to proudly label yourself that?Well then I challenge you to get up on a Saturday morning and drive your butt to Santa Barbara for....tacos. Yep, I said it. If you really want that title then you have to earn it and that takes a sense of adventure, a full gas tank and a willingness to go where no ma...um, oh, actually, it looks like 50+ yelpers have gone before...but you get the point and you need to get here, because La Super Rica RULES!I know this because my foodie partner in crime and brother from another mother called me Saturday morning at the early hour of...10:30am...and said...""Get up. Get showered. We'll be at your house in a half hour""""Whu? Who is this?""""We're goin to Santa Barbara, get up!""""Who gave you this number?!""""Shut it, we'll be in there in 30 minutes. Get up""""But I have to.... """"We'll see you in 30 minutes""""But...But...""*dial tone*Bah, he always wins those arguments!And so I didn't shower (out of sibling rebellion), but got out of bed and met him, his wifey to be and Abby (the cutest beagle in the world) and we hopped on the 101 and headed to SB. As we are driving he starts to tell me about this place and used a whole lotta words to describe it, but all I heard was ""Cheese and Bacon sauce."" Cuz seriously, are there any other words you need to hear besides Bacon or Cheese to drive 80 somethng miles? Me thinks not.After tooling around State Street and working up an appetite by making fun of people, including the red headed chick wailing like a dying animal in front of Borders (I think she called it singing), we finally headed over to this little turquoise and white taco place and it was on! We ordered 4 steak tacos, 3 beef tacos, 3 marinated pork tacos and then the number 15, oh yes, the bowl of cheese and bacon with tortillas. Magic, I tell ya. As we were ordering I looked behind the register guy to see a little lady pressing fresh tortillas from scratch and I was getting super excited! Talk about fresh and foodietastical!They then called our number and the feast was on! And wow, was this grub. Paired with a nice cold Pacifica with limes we chowed down how you like me now on these little tacos of awesomeness like there was no tomorrow. So deelish, so simple, just meat and tortilla and cheese and bacon since we added that to everything and even ate it straight from the bowl by the end of the meal! Yay.So definitely, DEFINITELY try this place if you are ever in SB and definitely use this as an excuse for a day trip!

11/19/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Okay I gave La Super-Rica four stars after my first visit, and now I feel that I was misguided.  This is a five star joint.  Just order right.As I mentioned in my first review, the salsa and tortillas alone are worth a visit to Julia Child's neighborhood taqueria.  They couldn't be fresher if they'd been picked off trees.Everything I tried on my second visit was absurdly delicious.  I was hungry and ordered a laughable amount of food for one person (Matt B. laughed), and just about finished it all.  I had sopes, a tamale, and quesadillas with chorizo.  Yum, yum, and yum.The sopes were crispy golden corn cakes, and they came with moist chicken and little chunks of avocado and radish.  These were flavorful and full of juice, and the avocado and radish were small flourishes but they added a lot, cutting the heaviness with a little vegetable cool.  The tamale was even better, delicious and corny with lots of savory pork and a nice creamy tomato sauce.  Neither the sopes nor the tamale were on the main chalkboard menu, so I don't know if they're available every day.  When they are, get them.  The quesadillas with chorizo are available whenever you please, and you should please as often as possible.  The chorizo is amazing.  I had the marinated pork my first time, and while it was good, the chorizo was clearly superior.  It was smoky, porky, and slightly spicy, with the perfect amount of resistance.  It melded seamlessly with the cheese and tortilla.  I will get these quesadillas any time I stop by Super-Rica.Matt's moving out of Santa Barbara, which means I'll have few opportunities to visit Super-Rica.  This makes me sad, but I'm certain to go back again.  The food is hard to beat, and I won't soon forget that.",5 star rating,Steph C.
4/4/2010,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA","When a former gf used to live up in SLO, this was a mandatory stop for me on the way up to visit. The gf's mom tipped me off about this shack and used to tell me even Julia Child's herself was a fan of what this kitchen was serving up. While everything on the menu is certifiably gold, a solid standout for me is, always and forever, the quesadilla suiza. Holy mother, this thing is thick, good and good for you. Tortillas are top notch, cheese is top notch, and taste is top notch. Are you pickin up what I'm puttin down? Are you!? Don't forget the horchata either, definitely one of my top three places for the rice drink on the face of the planet.Even back in the day the line coming outta this place was kinda defeating and demoralizing. Whatevs, make some friends, pop out that iphone or just think of your happy place, you'll make it to the front eventually. You would think there would be a roller coaster at the end. Or maybe even a pot of gold. I guess in some ways it is gold, isn't it? Yes, indeed. Despite the overcrowding, seats are plentiful in the back under the tarp and people are generally nice. Whenever friends are headed up to the SB area I'm always telling em to stop by and have a taste of what this place serves up daily. Not only is it some of the best i ever had, it's really the only place I know of in SB that i really eat at. I'm sure there are a ton of great places to visit, but it's hard to fix what ain't really broke.",5 star rating,Ron E.
12/30/2010,"East Bay, CA","EXTREMELY OVER-HYPED Mexican Street Fare, not worth the RIDICULOUSLY LONG wait.I know this review will draw the ire of many others up here, but I don't care. Listen up, those of you who wanted to try this spot: Unless you find yourself in the area close by, do NOT drive far to go here, unless you are visiting from somewhere else in the country, and have never had decent Mexican food.This place is the tiny taqueria, with a woman pressing tortillas, and men working the grills. Food looked great, service was good, but the food just wasn't unique or special. I get really similar food down on East 14th Street in Oakland, and where I live, I have access to incredible food any day of the week, in almost any city around the Bay. So my point is that unless you live somewhere in the country where there are no Mexicans, or the uniquely-like cuisine, why would you necessarily go here? I can see if you are a local in SB, but for me to drive 45 minutes, and then wait 45 minutes, to then come to this conclusion, didn't help the cause.And considering I went on a Thursday afternoon at around 3pm, I didn't understand why there were 30+ people in line. As a consumer, if you are in that long of a line, the food HAS to be spectacular, so the fact that it wasn't means I just wasted my time. For me, the expectation was high, and the food was a letdown. I'm sure there is killer Mexican food in town, and if you know, I'm taking recommendations.I came here predicated on two separate TV mentions. Guy Fieri is TRIPPING if he really thought this place was that good. And shame on him, as he is from Santa Rosa, and should know goddamn better.CASH ONLY, and no ATM's anywhere in walking distance. Yet another thing to piss me off, 30 minutes in to the wait. Get a credit card machine already.Eat here only if you find yourself in the neighborhood, and if you have time to kill......ALOT of time (45 - 60 minutes in waiting in line).",2 star rating,Sal G.

8/3/2010,"El Granada, CA","I love Mexican food.  I have made it a personal mission to travel all over this beautiful planet to try Mexican food and to seek out the best, and La Super-Rica is among the best.Why is it that, in this world of copy-cats, no one has bothered to copy La Super-Rica?Normally, I would discourage this practice, but these people are doing something so simple, yet so special, it begs to be shared with the world.  They use fresh, high quality, delicious ingredients, and more veggies (and more unique veggies) than most taquerias.  On my last visit, I had to wait about 40 minutes just to place my order, but the food was worth it.  Come prepared to wait, perhaps with a good book.  Parking will be tricky.I ordered a quesadilla with grilled pasilla peppers and a queso fundido with chorizo.  My daughter had what she said was the best chicken quesadilla of her life.  To simply call it a chicken quesadilla is sort of an insult, because that's what they make at Chevy's or El Torito, and this was something so much better.La Super-Rica is closed on Tuesdays, so plan accordingly!  You don't want to get your heart broken.",5 star rating,Raina S.
10/3/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Umm hello...three words to describe La Super Rica Taqueria is fresh fresh fresh. Freshly made tortillas + fresh guacamole + fresh pico de gallo are a deadly combination.  And to top it off I loved that I didn't feel awful after eating this - fresh is the way to go! I just tried this joint on Sunday and my recommendation is: 1) stay to eat it fresh (but bring a magazine or a hat as you may be waiting awhile in line to get in). 2) Added the hella fresh guacamole and equally fresh pico de gallo to the rather simple tacos (it's seriously just the freshmade tortillas and meat unless you get some other specialty). 3) And for godssakes, get the pozole if they've got it up on the specials board. The tacos are rather plain on their own but with the sauces they were pretty tasty.  I ordered a trip tip taco along with their #16 Super Rica Especial - chopped up pepper with pork on top of tortillas and smothered with cheese and I swear I will always order that one when I go.  So good after a  night of partying.

We waited in line for about 5-10 minutes and ordered: 1 adobado taco, 1 beef taco, 1 pork taco, 1 order of the sopes special, guacamole, horchata, and a coffee drink.The food did not impress me.

The shredded beef tacos were a hit, especially with the avocado crema. The 11 was also delicious. The cheese was melty...and tortillas were so amazing. I really didn't like the 14 because I didn't like the chorizo. There were tough chunks of fat in it that I couldn't eat. I also had the pinto beans (19) and they were good. My husband had 7, 10, & 16. He didn't like the tri-tip in the 7. It was tough and dry. He really enjoyed the 10...he likes that chorizo. And he loved that it was grilled and crunchy.

3/31/2010,"Richmond, VA","Once again, an AMAZING place to eat whenever I return to SB! This time I came with Charles L. who had to be exposed to the secrets of great SB eats!We got #16 Super Rica Especial with those pasilla peppers and very freshly cooked pork, smothered in cheese, on FRESHLY made tortillas! I never paid attention to the fact that they MAKE the tortillas there, and it shows! This is probably one of their best dishes, but everything is fresh and tasty.Also tried the Chili Relleno, which retained its crunchy fried-ness while being soaked in a tasty red sauce! A surprise is that it wasn't just filled with cheese but also grilled vegetables, creating a tasty dish that adds an air of home-cooked food to this cheap eat!The food isn't something that will compare to your taco truck or ubiquitously good mexican food throughout California. This food seems to add a very regional twist to classics, and keeping the food VERY fresh and tasty!Oh and don't miss out on the horchata, its a perfect accompaniment to a fantastic meal!

6/16/2009,"Fairfax, VA","Wow, let me start off by saying how surprised I am that most of these reviews are from tourists who visited SB once for a weekend. Granted, it says that I live in Seattle, but I lived in Santa Barbara 6 times longer than I've lived in Seattle. So let me give you all some context and a history lesson, and hopefully it should clear some things up. First, Mexico is a big country. So ""Mexican"" food does not just mean burritos, rice, and beans. De acuerdo? This food is the most authentic Mexican food you are going to get. Second, tourists hang out on State Street. What do you find on State Street? Bad restaurants, tourists, and stores that sell tourist shit. If you want to see the real Santa Barbara, cruise down Milpas. If you want to eat where the locals eat, go to La Superrica. Or if you want your rice and beans and your big Sunday brunch, then stay on State St and go to El Paseo. Why is there a line out the door? 1) Because the window to order is right inside the door. It's a small place. So you stand on the street. But it's not like it's cold, or hot, or rainy, or windy. So enjoy the sunshine and get your vitamin D while you wait. 2) There is also a line out the door because it's freaking good food. Why does the line move so slowly? They make the food when you order it. I know, novel idea, huh?Now for the history lesson- the owner of La Superrica was originally a grad student at UCSB. At some point he decided grad school was not for him and so he went back to Mexico, learned how to cook, then came back up to Santa Barbara and opened La Superrica. And I would say he's a lot more successful than other students who ended up getting PhDs. Because no one's writing about them on Yelp.Viva La Superrica!",5 star rating,Saritah K.
9/13/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","It is okay... but I question the reviews that single this out as being a holy pilgrimage. Maybe they live in places where their only choices of Mexican fare are either Taco Bell or Tia Maria's.After all the hype and super fans from far and wide extolling the tremendous, life changing experience of Super-Rica, I was expecting transcendence & mouth orgasm after mouth orgasm.  What we found was good quality home made food that was very traditional in a good authentic way serving everyone in at a rather untypical slow pace.  A painfully slow pace if you are hungry.We waited 50 minutes from the time we got there on a Saturday for lunch until we had food in front of us.Tips: Get there early.     -Bring some reading material and sunscreen and a hat if it is hot,       because the line can wrap around the block.   -Bring Cash   - Avoid on weekends If I were you, I'd put my money on the tamales, Alambre de Filete and some of the daily specials.  And don't forget the horchatta.  That is some freaking good horchatta.",3 star rating,Millsy M.

1/1/2007,"San Francisco, CA","Well, they told us the line was twenty minutes long when it was more like thirty five. Obviously, everybody and their mother knows about this place. We figured there's a reason for it and stood in line while starving. Honestly, it would have taken us the same amount of time to have found another suitable place to eat while our blood sugar was plummeting and, unable to make decisions, we would slowly starve, so we decided to just stay put. Anyway, I digress.There is nothing remarkable about this place. Nothing. A taco is just meat on a couple of tortillas, with nothing else. So I'm not Mexican myself or anything, but I do live in the mission district of SF and eat plenty of tacos on a regular basis, so I was a little surprised considering the fare I'm used to. Regardless, it was food and sustenance so I can't complain about that. Their dining room would be an adequate taqueria joint except that it suffers from the affliction of people who haven't ordered yet hovering to ""save"" tables by having one person sit there for twenty minutes (or however long the line is) while people who actually have ordered or are in possession of their food have nowhere to sit.",2 star rating,dana l.

6/1/2010,"Long Beach, CA","One word: Overrated I'm form LA and we have pretty decent and authentic Mexican food. this place just made LA Mexican food look like it was directly from Mexico.I was really excited and thinking that because there was a long line that the food must be amazing. I ordered a lot of food not expecting it to come out to be $30! So it is pricey as well.The food was BLAND. My friend tried to convince me that that is how real Mexican food was supposed to taste and that I'm supposed to add salsa for flavor. If I wanted to eat something filled with salsa, I would have just had scoops of Salsa (which are free) instead. I was HIGHLY disappointed and pissed that I spent so much on food that tasted bland (probably made to appeal to more people and their taste buds.)I had a carne asada taco (which was name something fancier sounding, but when it comes down to it's a carne asada taco) You can't go wrong with something so basic so I enjoyed it the most (It was 2.50 for ONE, it says it comes with 2 rtillas but so do most tacquerias in LA) I had Pozole. I was not impressed. I poured a whole thing of chili sauce so that I can taste something. I had the veggie tamale. It was sweet tamale which I didn't expectI had a pork tamaleI ended up dipping the tamales in various sauces to see which one brought out some flavor. No flavors were brought out. the food is just plain bland. I had the number 8 which i cant recall. But it was basically Chicken grilled with Bell Peppers and onions plus 3 tortillas. Ummm El Torito makes it WAY better.I had the Jamaica to drink... SMALL cup, and it was powdered Jamaica not the real brewed ones.

Its like comparing southern food to Chicago Deep Dish pizza's, its just not the same. The homemade tortillas, seasoned grilled meats on their taco's, their quesadilla's, their guacamole, fresh pico de gallo, and the specials are all amazing. It has been hyped up quite a bit over the last 10 years and there are other places that are also comparable in quality with less wait but they are damn good and damn consistent here.

8/22/2009,"Seattle, WA","Wow. We went at 3pm and the line was a 30 minute wait, so go on a day that you are feeling rather patient. It is well worth the wait.I ordered the pork, peppers and tortillas combo, boyfriend got the chicken with bell pepper and onion, and we shared the quesadilla and chile relleno. The chile relleno was the special of the day and was amazing with potato, zucchini, green beans, cheese and tomato stuffed inside of a long, deep fried chile. The pork pastilla dish I got was unreal- the flavor of the pork was fantastic, and the homemade corn tortillas had the best flavor and texture I've ever had in a corn tortilla. The maza was so fresh and you can see them making the tortillas and grilling everything on the grill, which is really nice. Their pico de gallo and guacamole rock. This place is out of this world and very unique style of food. I wish we would have gotten the tamale special. Their mexican rice is also fabulous and not too greasy or heavy. The quesadilla was rather bland and was the one thing we probably would pass on in the future.",5 star rating,Danielle H.

8/15/2007,"Santa Barbara, CA","My question to you is: who in their right mind waits 45 minutes for tacos?  I don't care how good they are.  They are tacos, people. TACOS.  Certainly ""super"" cannot, just would not, mean the food here.Seriously, I want you to reevaluate your ridiculous affinity for this place.  I think it's called ""food mecca"" syndrome.  As in, the unfortunate urge people feel to have a shared experience with a particular restaurant, often with mind-boggling disregard for quality.  Yes, ""food mecca"" afflicts La Super Rica.  The syndrome seems to particularly affect taquerias, local ice cream shops, sushi bars, and any place with homemade margaritas. I lived in SF for a while, and therefore I believe there's something to be said for the food itself.  45 minutes should be worth something really freakin' delicious, not just supposedly ever so slightly more ""authentic"" than the chain restaurants.  I actually like tacos that have some modicum of topping, like maybe some diced tomatoes, a bit of guac or sour cream, anything at all, really, more than just the meat haphazardly slapped on a soft tortilla.  La Super Rica, you are a taqueria, right?I also like to eat somewhere that looks like it's cleaned on a regular basis, where flies don't hover around the kitchen.  Oh, and it's always nice to be able to order and dine in a reasonable amount of time.Basically, I don't think I can respect someone that likes SRT, in terms of having independent thought,  in a general sense.  Sorry folks, you just don't get it.",1 star rating,MScott S.

A taqueria lives and dies by the quality of its meat prep, and brothers and sisters, tacos can't hide crappily prepared meat.And WTF is up with the long-ass wait AFTER you order your tacos? This must be the slowest taqueria I've been to.I sampled the following tacos:Bistec- dry, bland, not seasoned.Costilla- dry, tough, not seasoned.Chuleta- dry, not seasoned.Adobado- dry, bland, not seasoned well.Chorizo- nicely grilled, spicy chorizo.I tried the following items as well:Lomito Suizo - not bad, cheese helps the dryness of the meat.Chorizo Especial- cheese hardened and congealed soon after the dish arrived at our table. Difficult to eat. Chorizo was fine, same as found in the taco.Getting Montezuma's Revenge the next day 86'd this place for me. Culprit was most likely one of the salsas.

The tortillas are just like cake and they've been making them the same way for years. I always order the Especial and then one or two of the specials which never disappoint. Yes, I will drive the hour and half to eat there on a Saturday afternoon, it is worth it! The main thing to remember is that a) you will stand in line and b) the food takes a little longer to make so don't be in a rush-- plus, you want to enjoy your meal. This is NOT fast food!

I love my tacos with carne asada, cilantro, lime and hot salsa, i hate taco bell and del taco is whatevers. i had mexican food at least once a week for the past 4 years (that's what living in ghetto south LA does to you, your options are limited! but hey, mexcian food there is good fast and cheap)this place is interesting. first impression, how is this so randomly popular?the food was pretty good. i got the carne asada taco, and the special which was a carnitas with zucchini and in a bunch of sauce. the tortilla is also hand made and made to order, definitely fresh!the carne asada taco was pretty freakin goodbut the carnitas taco was a lil too much. kind of filling$3 for guac. really? REALLY? the mexican rice was apparently pretty good, i cannot appreciate mexican rice tho, i love my rice white and chinese =p but my friend said they're good, and they seem to be better than the others i've tried...however, this place is so over priced, it's unbelieveable! a meal for two came to be $24!! how?! and we didn't order that much! how can a taco be $2.50?!?!i thought it's supposed to be cheap mexican food. how is this so expensive, especially given the location and decor.i also paid like $2 for a dinky little shot of horchata. i didn't know people take shots of horchata!?i've had better horchata for half the price and triple the size. can we say stingy?!i just feel like this place is a rip off. but i'll give it 3 stars for its unique cuisine.tip: try their specials i guess? bigger portionsfavourites: fresh tortilla, solid fooddo not want: steep prices....not worth itlast words: a rip offffff, but at least it's unique, give it a try, but i'm not gonna be a regular customer, with the same kinda money, i can get waiter service by getting a main course from another decent restaurant.",3 star rating,Celine L.

The specials for the day are always good too.  The only thing that gets me is that the spot is blown up! it's been here for years and years and yes the whole Julia Childs deal. She's dead. But even then you still can read about this place in the NY Times and Playboy.

2/8/2014,"Barrington, IL","We stopped at Super-rica vefore a show at the Santa Monica Bowl and I'm glad we did. After reading many of the reviews here I. Knew this was the place in SB for a preconcert meal. We were not sure how much to order, but knew that we needed to try an assortment of dishes to get various tastes as flavor.  We had chorizo tacos.  We had a daily special beef taco with guacamole on the side.  We had a fish tamal, the #16 Super-rica Especial, and one other plate. The tamal was wonderful and very tasty and had a rich cream sauce on top. The fish almost tasted like shrimp- but it was a fish. Memorable. The SR especial included marinated pork, roasted pasilla pepper and melted cheese and 3 Homemade/Handmade/Fresh corn tortillas which are made while you wait. That plate was generous with the meat and pepper and well flavored although the fresh pico de gallo added more flavor. Everything was great. The line out the door moved at a decent pace and it took less time to get out order after we placed it than I expected.  Beer is cheap. I was disappoited that the Watermelon agua fresca had run out.  The smiling counterman who took our prder and money mentioned the Horchata as a possible alternative and Ibtried it for the first time in my life.  It was refreshing and sweet and can only be described as liquid rice pudding. Probably too sweet for many repeats for me, but it was good in the moment.  I'd stop back anytime I was near Santa Barbara because the food was great, the price was right (great value for the money), the experience was fun, and the portions were just right.  If La Super-Rica has gone downhill over time or is just resting on its laurels (and Julia Childs history of visits many years ago before she died), it must have been amazingly awesome then, because it is pretty awesome now.",5 star rating,Eric H.
9/5/2008,"Los Angeles, CA","I must admit that I'm a little late in the game finding out about La Super-Rica but very happy that I did.  On a recent drive down from SF I stopped in Santa Barbara to check out this fabled and legendary taqueria.  Having frequented my share of excellent taquerias up and down the coast I have to say that I was blown away by Super - Rica!!  My eating partner and I managed to put away 5 items that with tip came to $20, a great price for an even better feast.  The tamales with chayote, zucchini, corn, potatoes, and a few other ingredients I can't remember is one of the tastiest and most unique tamales I have had (and that's including the amazing tamales I had in Mexico City at LOS TAMALES EMPORIO).  The cheese and adobo pork in tortilla (forgot the name but I believe it was #15) was great too along w/ the bistec and various pork and bacon tacos.  Salsa bars can range from the divine to the extremely scary, Super Rica is on the divine side with beautifully fresh pico de gallo.  One dish I didn't have but will be sure to order next time is the #17.  It's a pasilla pepper stuffed with cheese, roasted, and then chopped with other meats and placed on top of a handmade tortilla.  You can't get much better than that.Santa Barbara is a great city to visit and now I have yet another reason to make the drive north.  One last note; luckily we didn't have to wait in line but the food is so good I wouldn't mind waiting in line.  You can also check out all the cooking going on.",5 star rating,Matthew S.

We were just in town for the day and were told this place was great - Julia Child said so, blah, blah, blah. Waited 40+ minutes and by the time we reached the front I will admit the menu board made the dishes sound delicious (could be that I was ready to faint by that point). I'd been inside holding a table for ages so by now I've seen how small the portions are - we knew to order a little more than we were planning to. Several steak tacos & chorizo and cheese tacos later - I'm thinking to myself, who thinks this much cheese is a good idea? At least all that cheese was hot because the steak tacos definitely were not. I think maybe we should have ordered the tamales as they looked really good. And on the subject of the homemade corn tortillas... I was really looking forward to them - I watched the woman making them one by one. In the end, they were doughy and also cold.  Maybe this is what authentic Mexican food is really like?Probably won't go back.",2 star rating,Charlotte C.

The portions are nice little tapas, so you're going to order more than one item at a time to fill yourself up. the prices are very good, especially considering the price of most food in Santa Barbara. They generally have specials that aren't on the chalk menu, so you may want to check the register window as well. There were generally additional vegetarian options on that menu, so us tree bark eating savages shouldn't have a problem here.I'd typically order the tamal de veduras, the rajas.

11/19/2008,"Oakland, CA","If this place isn't a divey hole in the wall restaurant then it's a glorified taco stand.  There are three inside tables that are about as big as the 'kitchen' (it's so small!) and a much bigger plastic-awning-covered patio area.  If it's crowded, and it will be, you might have to wait for a table that you then wipe down yourself.  I lead with that because it seems enough people go there with different expectations only to walk out somewhat dismayed.  With that said and hopefully understood....La Super-Rica rocks!!!I won't name specific menu items (ok, I will mention one, a special - the Tamals are filled with veggies and covered in a creme sauce and are so fresh and tasty) because there are so many great options.  I was there with a 'local' (can one be considered local if they weren't born there and don't live there now?) who picked out a few of their faves, all of which were delish, but I am sure that anything would have been good.  Everything, including the tortillas, is prepared right in front of you.  It's all very fresh (the place does serious bizness and is small so there's literally no room for stuff to sit around) and ultimately I walked out feeling like I had gotten a great deal on a bunch of great food (and a beer).I would say that without a doubt I will hit up Super-Rica the next time I'm in SB.",5 star rating,Jay W.
8/4/2011,"Ben Lomond, CA","At long last we have returned to Santa Barbara to dine at our favorite Mexican restaurant of all time, La Superica. Yesterday we left Santa Cruz, just under a 5 hour drive, planning to drive straight there for a long awaited lunch. Much to our dismay  they are closed on Wednesdays, so we had to wait until today. Be careful about dining here for you will be forever changed by the experience. Their tortillas are made on the spot and are for us a nearly religious experience. The thin orange salsa which my husband describes as ""thermo-nuclear"" is tasty but should be used sparingly by most mere mortals. The green salsa is amazing as it changes flavors as you enjoy it, starting out pleasantly spicy, then with a sweet and fruity flavor, and finishing up with a savory vegetable tanginess which is out of this world. The pico de gallo is perfectly balanced and always amazingly fresh.  My go to dishes are number 7 Alhambra de fillet, number 12, pechuga Suisse, and number 19 the homemade frijoles. My party all agree to pass dishes around so that we can taste as many flavors as possible. I've eating here for over twenty years and I hope to do so for many years to come.",5 star rating,Tamera S.

You never know what's on special, but you end up trying stuff out of sheer curiosity. I've never been disappointed, but then I've never been totally impressed either. However, it is one of those local favorites, so I guess you gotta go.",3 star rating,Joanne R.
2/12/2007,"Long Beach, CA","This was my first time eating at La Super-Rica and maybe my last.  I decided the cause for all the hype must be the meat or something, because the vegetarian options really weren't all that great.I had Tamal de Verdura (?) which was a vegetable tamale.  It was a little over $3, which isn't bad for world famous mexican food, but still - not worth the price.  The tamale was filled with chayote, corn, squash, and a couple other things, but wasn't FILLED, you know?  The thing overall was pretty thin.  Smothered in a milky sauce which I wasn't all that fond of.  The taste was alright though, just nothing remarkable.My girlfriend got the Queso de Cazuela for around $3 as well.  She loves cheese, but this wasn't what we were expecting in the slightest.  Our food came and it was literally just a big melted blob of cheese in a pinkish tomato juice broth.  Comes with 3 tortillas (each one about the circumference of an orange), so she just kind of scooped the cheese onto the tortillas and ate it that way.  Not sure exactly how we were supposed to tackle this one.  I was still hungry so I got a quesadilla for a little under $2.  The handmade tortillas themselves were really good (albeit tiny) and the melted cheese was so-so.  Not spicy or anything, just kind of like melted white cheese.Overall, I guess the food matches the clientele.  While the exterior may look like your average tasty taqueria, the average customer was well over 60 years old.  Can't exactly inject too much flavor into stuff they could serve at the Senior Citizen's Center.  I'm not saying this place is awful by any means, but there's farrrrrrrr better taquerias out there and they all have shorter lines.",3 star rating,Bryan R.
8/8/2006,"Manhattan, NY","Great Mexican stand - lives up to the hype.Here's a clip from an article by Cindy Price in last week's NY Times surveying taquerias up and down the coast (NY is finally discovering real tacos!):""Do rich people eat tacos? I had heard that wealthy Santa Barbara was a hotbed of authentic taco activity, but I was hard-pressed to believe it. A cruise down quaint, tree-peppered North Milpas Street, however, confirms it. The street is lined with taquerias, including the one that started the craze --- La Super Rica Taqueria.Known to many as ""the Julia Child joint"" --- she was a loyal customer until she died two years ago --- La Super Rica is bright and airy, and the tortillas are handmade on the spot. On the cashier's recommendation, I pair a taco de bistec (charbroiled steak) with a queso de cazuela (a heavenly cheese baked in tomato sauce).Just as I'm sitting down with the owner, Isidoro Gonzlez, a white-bearded passer-by leans in. ""It's not just a taqueria, it's the best restaurant in town,"" he says. Heart be still, it's David Crosby. A fellow taco-hound! ""You don't have to continue any further,"" he says, eyes twinkling.

8/26/2010,"Tracy, CA","I went to school in SB and had no idea this place even existed. Venue - pretty small. It has a little taqueria feel. So, don't get super dressed up or anything - it's a casual kind of place (my cup of tea). Customer service was good. You order at a window, pick up your food at another window, then you find your seat.We ordered the fish tamale, beef taco, & a cheese suiza. The fish tamale was my favorite by far! I've never had a fish tamale and theirs was splendid. Just the right amount of fish and cheese to top it off. Yum! Beef taco was just ok. And I can't even remember much about the chicken suizas.Only negative thing I can say, is that we waited a while for our food. I think it's because they make their own tortillas or something.  We waited over half an hour for 3 dishes, but the wait is definitely well worth.I would definitely come back here for their fish tamale though. Yummy!Just a suggestion - go early. Or expect to wait an hour or two...this place is always packed!",3 star rating,Annette Y.

8/17/2010,"Huntington Beach, CA","Definitely did not live up to the hype.Seeing the one $ symbol, the 200+ reviews, and the 4 star rating, I was preparing myself for a treat. Many of the reviews mentioned some fatty lines, so I thought this must be some good stuff.I ate at this place later in the night so I did not have to wait in any line at all...yet, there was still a pretty long wait between the time I ordered and the time I actually got my food. During that long time I had the time to think about a lot of things, including how good that food must taste after all the hype and the time it took to prepare it.and boy was I let down. To be fair, I did not order one of the more fancy items on the surprisingly short menu- I ordered some tacos. When the tacos were finally prepared, however, I just saw some meat on some tortillas...I thought, ok, maybe the meat/tortillas tastes amazing. After the 5 mins it took me to finish the 2 orders of tacos I ordered, I thought, wow...how did this place get such good reviews? Everything about the place/food was mediocre at best.Normally, I would be a fan of simplicity but the food has got to be top notch at the simplest level. I can't say that the beef and tortillas tasted anything different than what I have had at any other restaurant. That said, I've also gotten a lot more at other mexican restaurants. They at least give me tacos with lettuce and pico de gallo and maybe even guac. If there are indeed the long lines during the day, you will not find me there.",3 star rating,Joe W.

1/17/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","A getaway weekend to SB wouldn't be complete without stopping and doing a little Los Agaves vs La Super Rica comparison.  Having lived in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Orange County all our lives, we definitely can appreciate good Mexican food.We liked the family style, old-school ambiance of La Super Rica but was slightly irked as it took FOREVER to get our food once we ordered, and they got our order wrong TWICE.  We noticed the people before us and after us also had their orders wrong so maybe they were asleep behind the wheel that night.The home made tortillas were good but a little thick in my opinion.  The pico de gallo was super fresh and definitely enhanced the meal.  The guacamole was good but not life changing.  My husband ordered the #16 and a chorizo taco...and received a #16 and a pork taco.  He liked his meal though. I got the veggie tamale (which I LOVED) and a quesadilla, which they had to be reminded about.All in all, I'm glad we went, but if I had to choose one it would be Los Agaves (I understand that both are totally different animals though).",3 star rating,HipGal M.

3/17/2008,"Santa Clara, CA","During a recent road trip, my boyfriend and I stopped here at 11:30am on a Sunday, after some friends in NorCal told us it was not to be missed. True to all other reviews, there was a 15 minute wait - but being huge Yelp fans, we were happy to chill in line since the reviews were so positive. Boy were we disappointed. After all the hype, the food was just so-so. My bf's tri-tip taco was pretty bland, and my pork suizo had an unexpected sweetness to it, and lacked much flavor. I also ordered the alhambre pechuga, which was diced chicken with green peppers, onions, mushrooms on a corn tortilla. Again, nothing very exciting, about as plain as the menu description itself.The lone bright spots were the horchata (mexican rice milk - cold and sweet, served in paper cups with ice), fresh corn tortillas (chewy and soft), and the chorizo. That said, though, given the line and lack-luster cuisine, we won't be coming back here to get our Mexican food fix. Final note, this is my first Yelp review ever - this place was such a far cry from Yelp's usually consistent reviews, I had to speak up!

I recommend ordering a bunch of different items to try (they are all small).

2/23/2013,"Santa Barbara, CA","Less than mediocre taco joint, running on seemingly nothing more than a good word from the late Julia Child at SOME point in history. I have to believe after eating there a few times, that whatever Julia Child found amazing about this place must be long gone. The time it took to place an order was long (about five minutes) with only one person ahead of us in line. It took a half hour to get our three tacos and the place was not crowded. The tacos were tasteless and I really was amazed out how blah it was. We went there only because our friends who were visiting from LA had heard about it and wanted to go. I had never heard that it was put on the map because of Childs until they informed me of this as we ate there today. I have been there 3 times during my 13 years of living in SB, and in the past I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about? Today I finally concluded that there truly is NOTHING to be excited about, just a good review gone bad! Sadly, there are enough tourists who will make the mistake of eating there at least once, to keeping the line out the door on Child's outdated seal of approval... and the cycle will continue...They may have been good at some point, but fame has a way of changing things, even a taco stand.",2 star rating,Joel H.

5/20/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Super Rica is a perfect example of an overrated place.  It's not bad, in fact it's pretty decent.  But its reputation is way out of proportion to the reality.I ate here a few times when I was growing up, didn't eat here for many years, and then have come two or three times in the last several months, in addition to sampling their stuff at the Taste of Milpas food festival.  The experience is usually the same: I come in, I order something, I get what I ordered, and its pretty good, never really bad but never anything that blows me away or even really catches my attention.The best thing about the food is the tortillas, which, as everyone knows by now, are handmade.  The meats in the various tacos are so-so.  Seasoning-wise they leave quite a bit to be desired compared to many other Mexican places in town.  For some dishes, the flavor is quite bland unless you pile on the salsa.I've found that the specials are usually better than the regular menu items.  This is especially true of the tamales.  This is one of the few places in town that sometimes has unusual kinds of tamales (something other than the standard beef/chicken/pork/cheese choices).  However, you can never know what the specials are going to be until you get there and look at the board, so it's just the luck of the draw.One plus is that the dining area has a cool, sort of shabby-chic funky vibe.  A corresponding minus is that the design of the counter where you order is quite poor.  Everyone always notices that ""the line is out the door"".  Well, if you've been here, you know that the ordering window is only about five feet inside the front door, so the line will be ""out the door"" if there are more than two or three people in line.Also, there's something about the place that just gives you the impression they're coasting on their reputation.  There may have been a time when you could get away with being cash-only, giving everything on the chintziest of the chintzy plastic plates, not having a free water dispenser, and that sort of thing, because you were ""authentic"", but that time is past.  There may have been a time when offering handmade tortillas and some options beyond the standard asada/pastor/chicken tacos was enough to set you apart from the crowd, but that time too is past. There are literally dozens of restaurants in the Santa Barbara area that offer Mexican food every bit as good and authentic as Super Rica, but they just offer it in the context of a regular restaurant that doesn't give itself airs.  There's something vaguely prima-donna-ish about Super Rica, as if it wants you to overlook its flaws because it's been around a long time and famous people like it.Don't buy into the hype.  Super Rica is worth a look, but it's not the flavor extravaganza its reputation might suggest.  It may have been ahead of its time in the Julia Child glory days, but other restaurants have stepped up their game in a big way, relegating Super Rica to merely a middle-of-the-pack position.",3 star rating,Brendan B.

10/12/2011,"Fountain Valley, CA","This place hits the spot.  The portions are generous, the tortillas are fresh and absolutely out-of-this-world, guac is fresh, and service is quick and pleasant.  I tried the chile relleno w/ cream sauce (milky and cheesy, but no heat whatsoever - $8), #3 which is a unmarinated pork taco (basic, meaty perfection - $2.50), #7 and #8 (I forget which was which, but one plate was chicken w/ onions and peppers, and the other was the same thing but with beef - $8 each) also delish.  I was put off by the storefront (I don't know why I was expecting to see a real restaurant, but I was), as it's basically a walk-up taco take-out place with seating on the side.  VERY underwhelming interior and exterior, but naturally bright and clean.  The only thing that could make this place better is if they served tamarindo. Other important info: CASH ONLY, portions are large considering the price point, must order a few entrees in order to make a real meal out of the it, tortillas are the best I've tasted, park on the street because it's much easier and abundant.",3 star rating,T C.
3/9/2007,"Goleta, CA","Overated. That was my impression after eating here many years ago. It seems a lot of people rave about this place mainly because Julia Child and other celebs ate here. But as a local who has eaten at many other taquerias along the same street, my opinion is that this place is nothing special. I find the food here to be a little bland, less flavorful for the same dish than other places on Milpas St. Truthfully, I never had a good vibe for this place because I hardly ever see Latinos standing in line out front. Whenever I hear of a ""good"" ethnic restaurant and I don't see members of that ethnic group eating there, it's a cause for hesitation. For good, inexpensive tacos, I used to always go to Taqueria El Buen Gusto a few blocks down. Also a few blocks away, Taqueria El Bajio is delicious for tortas. If you want seafood, Mariscos Boca De Rio has whole fried Tilapia & other items. I would go to any of these places before I go to La Super Rica.",2 star rating,Shin H.

The tamal de verdura is really really good which is what I ordered and a taco de calabacita. Since I have been going for years, I know the routine as far as ordering.

Seriously nothing special and definitely not worth the ridiculous wait. They had tamalitos which vaguely reminded me of my mom's pastels (or pasteles) but only because they were wrapped in banana leaves not because of the taste.  The husband tried it 20 years ago and it's still not that great.

I found the steak to be a little chewy, and it's hard to argue with the flavorful marinade on the pork. My friend ordered the Super-Rica Especial and I definitely want to order that next time.

Its a mix of satiated onions and chilies mixed with melted cheese. I get tacos and add the rajas with some hot sauce. The tortillas are hand made and fresh to order. It has a great seating area in a covered patio. It's a kid friendly establishment complete with high chairs. Usually when you arrive its got a line out the door especially around meal times. It can take awhile to get through the line and the wait for food to be prepared can be a while too but its well worth it. So don't show up hangry. Its cash only and while the prices are reasonable the orders are small so you usually order multiple dishes and feeding the family can be more expensive in the end than you might anticipate.

5/16/2008,"Los Angeles, CA","We had to stop by because I found out Julia Child was a fan of Super Rica.Honestly, I don't see what she saw or tasted in this place. Her choosing Super Rica as her favorite taqueria leads me to believe she had a terrible palate or didn't know what Mexican food should taste like.I don't want to knock this place because it's got a great little vibe and the place was packed with non-Mexican eaters. Any Mexican restaurant that can get folks to order items that they can't get at Taco Bell deserves credit. I would shake the owner's hands if I knew who he was.But here's the thing, I grew up on the food that's served here. Pozole, tacos, gorditas, queso con rajas. I expected the food to taste like the food I ate in Zacatecas or Mexicali or Guanajuato. Instead, it was incredibly bland. The poor meats needed lots of salt to coax any flavor out of them. Well, they did have a nice charcoal grilled flavor to them, which was really smokey and authentic. My gordita, while handmade, didn't taste like much when I bit into it. It was spicy, that's for sure, but the texture reminded me of homemade paste. You know, flour and water warmed up on the stove.I'd come back to try other items again, but only if I've got plenty of extra time to wait on line to do some people watching.

In fact I would say that I probably like La Super Rica as much as the city of Santa Barbara itself, LOL... I swear I make that 1 1/2 hour drive just for those tacos... But really folks, you can't go wrong with any dish there. The tortillas are fresh and the guacamole is amazing. I've had the tamales, tortas, tacos and quesadillas and still haven't scratched the surface of the menu. It's a quaint little blue building right off of Milpas street (drive about 1 mile off of the freeway) and there is always a line out the door. The prices are awesome and it's worth the short walk as nearby street parking is sometimes full. Again, I HIGHLY recommend this place. If it was good enough for Julia Child (I've heard it was her favorite Mexican restaurant) then it's good enough for me!",5 star rating,Justin T.
4/12/2010,"Cambridge, MA","Delicious! Suggested by friends at UCSB as the best Mexican place around - as echoed in the 200+ other reviews here - La Super-Rica is an awesome, unassuming little place that dishes up amazing food.Moist, fresh tortillas are made on the spot, forming the base for delicious tacos and quesadillas as well as being served alongside soups or just about anything else on the menu.Overhyped? Maybe -- lines were out the door in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, but the food was standout delicious enough that I would wait again in a heartbeat.",4 star rating,Anthony R.
2/21/2011,"Minneapolis, MN","This place is awesome! We got here at 11am and huddled underneath the awnings to avoid being pelted by the rain.  I highly reccomend the spiced coffee, and the mushroom taco that is on the special menu.  The mushroom taco will convert those who have never appreciate good fungus. Make sure you bring cash and an appetite.  This is a must visit!",5 star rating,Cait B.
12/29/2015,"Pleasanton, CA",Loved the place. Waited in line for 45 minutes yesterday. Totally worth the wait. Tried the #16 pork. Very tender and flavorful. Tamales were excellent. Liked it so much that went back today for more. Another 40 minute line to get the Chile Relleno. Oh my! Delicious. Wish I could come here more. Lovely owner and lovely food. Don't expect anything upscale. It is a hole in the wall kind of place. But the food is unbeatable.,5 star rating,Cassie M.
6/13/2007,"Woodside, CA","I haven't had line issues but I usually eat here around 11 AM, before most of the lunch crowd arrives.  The food is fairly good (#16 with a Horchata is my fav) but I can think of a number of similar spots all over LA that deliver comparable food with less waiting time.",4 star rating,Eddy L.
7/22/2007,"San Francisco, CA",So good.  Get anything that has cheese on it and the horchata (best I've ever tasted).  Enjoyed the super-rica especiale and guacamole as well.  I would say 2-3 orders per person.  Ambiance is total hole in the wall but I appreciate the fact that there is a covering above the seating area.,4 star rating,Melinda C.
6/22/2008,"Encinitas, CA","Recently visited this run-down taco shop for the first time, and it's a gift from god. It's not your usual California taqueria fare, but more along the lines of what you'd expect to find in Mexico's interior. I had the lomito suizo which was chunks of incredibly flavorful marinated pork stuffed into a small quesadilla on corn tortillas that the lady makes right in front of you. The adobada tacos were fantastic as well. High-quality hot sauce. All but a few items are priced at roughly $3 or so, and I imagine that 2 or 3 items would be a solid enough meal for most folks. Do it.",5 star rating,Junk C.

The tortillas were so soft and fluffy. They were out of this world. Really, they didn't taste like a regular tortilla or anything from this earth. Especially when they had a huge gob of green guacamole, which my boyfriend ate as a guacamole taco, because the whole thing was so deliciously edible. We had the steak and carnitas tacos.

The line was long as expected but did move fast. It was also cool getting to see all the food being made even before you order. Me and my boyfriend split steak tacos #2, chile pasilla tacos #7? And the mushroom special tacos. The steak was really disappointing, and not flavorful and not that warm either, it was blah. The mushroom tacos were amazing but way to rich it made me feel sick. Overall the meal was just not that good. Unless you're going just for their delicious tortillas, go to el sitio or Lilly's for just hands down better tacos.",2 star rating,Lauren K.

It isn't just crazy delicious, fresh, simple food... the staff were incredibly friendly with everyone (and there were some annoying patrons). They smiled endlessly and when I asked about cilantro in the guacamole, the man replied cheerfully 'we can make it for you without!'. I don't get that kind of fresh food & service at restaurants 20x the price. And those tortillas... i don't know how they're so amazing but they are. My mouth is still watering. Thanks, La Super Rica!

6/6/2011,"Alameda, CA","If you don't like La Super Rica, then you don't get it. Nuff said. One word: Rajas! Rajas is a mixture of poblano chiles and cheese. You buy several orders and mix it onto everything else you get. HEAVEN on a plate. I have noticed rajas popping up on other restaurant menus. Thank God because it is delicious.There is no other Mexican food like this available anywhere in California. Trust me, I have looked. I asked the staff and they said the food is from the Southern Region of Mexico. Basically it is small plates of tacos, chili's with veggies and cheeses on handmade tortillas etc. No burritos here. Each plate is under $3 unless you venture to the Alhambres which are bigger portions and still only $6. I agree cash only sucks, but really it is ok to make the extra stop at the atm. It is part of the ritual, as is waiting in line in the sunshine.I use to live across the street, wow I was lucky. Since then I moved away to San Jose and always stop by when traveling to So Cal. I have waited in long lines in the sun when I had no time to wait at all. Recently I waited only 10 minutes because it was raining.

12/8/2008,"Santa Barbara, CA",This place is a historic part of Santa Barbara Latin cuisine... This is a place that everyone must try!

6/5/2009,"Chicago, IL","It is very good BUT:- I kind of prefer ""traditional"" / basic taquerias and this place doesnt really fit that bill.  Its kind of specialized in more complicated dishes (than just the perfect taco w/ meat, cilantro, onion maybe hot sauce on homemade tortiallas).  So if you understand what I mean, then just choose when to go there accordingly.- The lines CAN be ridic.  If you go for lunch go at like 11 (I think that's when they open) or like 2 PM.  Its also a lot easier to park around those times.- I dont really like their pork - whats it called? achiote maybe... I have had it at lots of places in the area and I think the flaovor of theirs is kind of weird, and not good.  Its one of the spices - tastes too much like cocoa or nutmeg or coffee - that I don't like.  The fact that your tortilla is a pile of masa until you order is awesome (and that you see it happen doesn't hurt). Despite all that, its still really good just go there for a break rather than expecting it to be a really good version of the other mexican spots.",4 star rating,Tu'ens N.

2/3/2010,"Solvang, CA",After having read the reviews on this site and others I was excited to have a free morning to try Super Rica.  I arrived there just after 11:00 in the morning and found no line.  Awesome off to a great start.  I ordered a bistec taco and one of the daily specials(a tamal).  Food was ready in about 15 minutes.  Not bad considering everything is made fresh in front of you.  Once I recieved my food and a sampling of the salsas I dug in only to be really disappointed.  The food had absolutely no flavor.  The bistec was not seasoned at all (I guess they rely  on you using the salsas) and the tamale had the same problem even though it was full of fresh veggies. I might go back one more time to see if I went on a off day But if there is a line it would not be worth the wait if I experience the same bland food (really no taste at all).,2 star rating,marcella o.

11/12/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","My friend said that this was the place to go if we wanted to eat tacos. The line was not that long once we got there. The elderly gentleman that takes the order is a bit slow, but very nice and helpful. We ended up waiting about five to eight minutes in line. I ordered the grilled chicken with melted cheese in between two hand made tortillas. My friend ordered two steak tacos. Needless to say, the portions are small. The food was really good, but a bit pricey with the kinds of portions that were given. One taco was about $2.50. I could have given this review a full five stars on taste alone, but the small portions are the down side if you are really hungry. If you aren't the type to overeat and indulge on food, then the portions are just right. Either way, I do recommend this place, but be prepared to bring a lot of money if you want more portions. I ended up spending close to $20 when all we had was two tacos, grilled chicken, two horchatas and a side of guacamole.

Definitely not a fancy place @ all, in fact you have to stand in a line (sometimes so long that it wraps outside of the restaurant) and then give the cashier your order, and then pay in cash! They don't take ATM or credit cards, cash only! Usually once u put your order in it doesn't take more than 15 mins for your food. My favorite is La Super Rica Especial and any of the cheese bowls.

3/26/2008,"San Francisco, CA","Lunch date: March 22, 2008Company: The fam & BFWhen people ask me where I am from and I tell them Santa Barbara the response goes something like, 'Oh...rough life! I can't believe people actually live in that paradise.' I immediately let them know that I am aware of my good fortune not just because I grew up here but also because I had access to La Super Rica my entire life. I have always believed that if you truly love someone you will show them by taking them to this Santa Barbara landmark and letting them experience some of the best Mexican food in the country.I grew up going to Super Rica with my parents who never eat out because their cooking is so amazing that there is no need to seek sustenance elsewhere but they love SR. I remember always sneaking in through the back kitchen door to visit the 90 year old woman who made tortillas by hand. She reminded me of my grandma and so I would call her Abuelita for years until she sadly passed away. I have more memories from meals at Super Rica than I can count and the only constant throughout is the #12-Pechuga Suiza and a small horchata. This is basically SR's version of a chicken quesadilla. No matter how many times I have tried to replicate it, it never quite turns out. A succulent piece of perfectly cooked chicken covered in cheese lies happily in between two homemade corn tortillas. If your lucky during its time on the grill some of the cheese will burn ever so slightly and the taste will change enough to blow your mind. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu but my heart stays true to #12. Other great ones to try are: chorizo con queso, Super Rica especial and gordita de frijoles (super spicy!). The last time I went was last weekend with my family and my boyfriend on a typical beautiful day in Santa Barbara.

3/21/2011,"Beverly Hills, CA",My gf and I were looking for authentic Mexican food and we certainly found it.  This place has a wide variety of tacos ranging from spicy beans to chorizo.  We tried 8 items off of the menu and everything but the spicy bean gordita was delectable.  The best thing we ate was the plain ole quesadilla.  I would say one of the best I've ever had.  The pork steak tacos are also very good.  I must say I was a little bit shocked at how pricey it was given the hole in the wall atmosphere.  The horchata was to die for.  The owner was very friendly and added to an overall positive experience.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.  Excellent food!,4 star rating,Larry C.
4/19/2011,"Los Angeles, CA",Have the specials! Unreal tamales with cream sauce. Tacos de rajas are fabulous. The tocino especial(cheese fondue with bacon) will stop your heart! The tortillas are made on the spot. Go early and on weekdays to avoid lines. I find it's great to go with four people and order all over the menu and share. The pico de gallio is not to be missed. Yum is all I can say.,5 star rating,Craig L.

It being a taqueria, we ordered a few different tacos. The tortillas were freshly made, but I found them bland and uninteresting. The tacos are served on two tortillas, and include nothing but the meat (which seemed overcooked and lacking in spice). Apparently the tamales are something to try, but I don't believe we will be coming back.",2 star rating,Dane L.

Had the Super Rica Especial - was pretty tasty, but no way good enough to make me want to wait through the agonizing lines again.  The main reason they have long lines is not because of the food and prices, it's that they are not well organized. The organization of the ordering line is outrageously bad. They could easily speed things up at this place, by observing, say, the way a place like in-and-out flows their customers through.

Cha, ""Super"" doesn't even get close to describing how seriously ""Rica"" this place is.  I propose ""Holy-freaking-build-a-monument-for-it-Super"" ... -Rica.""  Our Mamma and Papa GRUB used to hit up this spot back in the day, a random dude at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia told me to hit it up (side note ... Arcadia is like 100 miles from SB ... who is this guy? Or better question ... how ridiculously amazing is this place going to be?), and then when I caught my favorite radio show, The Petros and Money Show (PMS), talking them up ... it was like the holy-trifecta of Good Grub recommendation.  And so our mission to hit up La Super-Rica Taqueria was born.  And when my one year wedding anniversary rolled around, what better town to recommend to my bride than Santa Barbara?  Yeah ...  We can check out the amazing beaches, walk around downtown, take a stroll along the bike path down by the Zoo ... and did I mentioned we might be hitting up a legendary taco spot?  Can you say ... romance?  As you pull up to the joint, realizing there's no sign up on the building ... and the line is out the door ... well, let's just say brace for something epic.  I mean seriously ... it's a hole-in-the-wall if there ever was one, but not just a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-wall frequented by Julia Child (sorry, but now I can't get this Julia Child SNL video out of my head).  Gazing up at the menu board, I remembered from my days back as a little kid about their amazingly scrumptious tacos, but is was Money from PMS that lead me to hitting up the Chorizo Especial ...  a bowl of gooey, melted cheese encasing hearty chunks of chorizo ... matched up with a pile of fluffy, hot tortillas to make your own mini-taco-quesadilla-creations.  To our order we added a taco de adobado (aka pork marinated in happiness), an order of chile con queso (for my veggie-loving-wife), and a heaping side of guacamole.  As we waited in line, we got to peak into the kitchen and see the fresh, hand-made-tortilla-making action up close.  Everything we got was pretty much unreal ... the meat was flavorful and tender, the tortillas were out-of-this-world, and the queso ... oh man, the queso.  Let's just agree on one thing ... you better make sure you can tolerate some lactose before you hit up La Super-Rica.  The cheese was thick and rich ... so much that Baby Carlos was pretty much in shock over how good it looked ... not at the table Carlos.  We bathed everything in their trio of dangerously good salsas ... a fresca, a roja, and a verde ... all with a tiny bit of bight and a ton of sweet flavor.  It was a magical way to spend our one year anniversary ... or any day for that matter.  So thank you La Super-Rica ... I can tell we're going to make it for the long hall ... is it two early to start thinking about coming back for year two?",5 star rating,Jeff B.

They also had a vegetarian tamales filled with corn, chayote, and topped with some cheese sauce, which was to die for! My husband thought this place was pretty good, but not that great (and he's actually from Jalisco, so he knows what good, authentic Mexican food is).

6/23/2011,"Lakeside, CA","I LOVE this place, but to really get the most out of it, you need to know a few things up front (bad news first):1) The line is usually long/slow (20-30 minutes?), so don't go if you're starving or in a hurry.2) Parking is a pain.3) The portions are small, so order more than you normally would, and expect to pay a higher total than you normally would for Mexican food at a ""taco stand"" - but the quality is so good that most people think it's well worth it, plus it gives you a chance to explore the menu more.4) The tacos are small and simple, just a little meat on a small fresh made corn tortilla (delicious!).  You can put salsa on if you want to spice things up, but don't expect any lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, etc.5) There is a little ""daily specials"" board to the left of the big permanent menu board.  The rice and beans listed there are the best you'll ever eat, and look expensive until you taste them, and the entre items on that little menu are typically amazing - try them!6) Nothing on the menu is super hot (spicy), so don't be afraid if it contains ""Roasted chile pasilla"", ""Chorizo"", or ""Marinated pork"".  Those are only medium spicy, and really tasty.Most (North) Americans will only recognize about four of the twenty items on the permanent menu (3 of the 5 tacos and the quesadilla) so if you only order what you recognize, you'll probably miss the magic.  To understand what all the fuss is about, you really need to order some things you've never heard of, even if they look a little spooky, like #16 ""Super-Rica Especial: ""Roasted chile pasilla stuffed w/ cheese, with marinated pork + 3 tortillas"", or the truly weird sounding #15 - Tocino Especial: ""Melted cheese with bacon served with 3 homemade tortillas""; it's heavy, but also heavenly.  I always order those two, and if there's a tamale on the daily special menu, GET IT!",5 star rating,Conrad P.
8/13/2007,"Sacramento, CA","After hearing only rave-reviews about this joint, I decided that I had to visit it and try it out at least ONCE before my time in Santa Barbara was up. I frequented this place on Cinco De Mayo with my BF who happens to LOVE Mexican food, with a passion. However, like myself, he was very disappointed in the food and mystified about all the hype that it has and still does receive. We arrived at 10:50 am, 10 minutes before it opened, and good thing we did because at 5 after 11 this place was slammed with a looooong line out the door. We ordered WAY to much food, as usual, and nothing really jumped out at us. The tortillas were hot out of the oven, and that was pretty much the highlight out of everything we ordered . The meat was all pretty flavorless, (We had the pollo, carne asada and carnitas), and you needed to load up on the salsa to get your taste buds to really react. I wish I would have tried the Chile Relleno which I hear everyone who tries it becomes instantly addicted. Oh well. Overall the food here is okay, and not spectacular. La Super Rica is overrated and not worth your time of standing in line or waiting for a spot to eat at the limited, and kind of depressing and gross, outdoor seating area.If you are in the mood for some cheap and amazing Mexican food, hit up Super Cucas, and get the California Burrito with AL PASTOR or carne asada tacos. You will not be disappointed. I promise.",2 star rating,S D.
7/25/2010,"North Hollywood, CA","I am a 100% lifelong fan of La Super Rica Taqueria. We stopped there last week on the way to Santa Barbara's CA Wine Festival. My friends made sure we arrived by 10:30 a.m. and we were the first ones there, other than the tireless staff who were already working non-stop getting the food ready for the daily onslaught of hungry bodies. Ever since Julia Child stopped here to savor their fare, this place has been consistently busy. In fact, when we passed by after a short version of a New Orleans dinner in SB, the line was still around the corner. I tried the Tacos de Bistec ($2.50) which was a basic taco with strips of grilled steak served on a 2 homemade tortillas. When we arrived early in the am, one lady was busy making these homemade tortillas by hand. And they are the real thing and real tasty. Each of our group then devoured the Tamal Chiapaneco de pollo ($6.), which is a meal fit  for a King (Or Queen!) It was phenomenal! It was a large tamale filled with chicken, almonds, raisins, plantain and egg white in a mole sauce. We actually found a large date in the mixture which made the taste even better. Bottom line, get there early and be ready for a taste that your tastebuds will thank you for a very long time! Delicioso!",5 star rating,Gary M.

8/31/2005,"San Francisco, CA","At first glance, this nondescript - except for its vivid turquoise paint job - shack hardly looks like the type of dive Julia Child would have visited once, let along frequented on a regular basis. But this was in fact a favorite of the grande dame of French cuisine, who spent her final years in upscale Montecito, the lush enclave of the rich and sometimes famous located at the eastern end of Santa Barbara. I'm not sure if Julia was forced to line up with the rest of the regulars who do just that, often up to an hour, all day long throughout the year. The tiny kitchen specializes in gourmetized versions of the street food sold on corners in sleepy little Mexican towns. There are no chips and dip here, nor is it a place where the same four ingredients are combined in twenty different preparations. Tamales are overloaded with corn, onions, chayote, and pasilla peppers. Tacos, made with thick, handmade corn tortillas, bear little resemblance to those found in Tex-Mex joints - taco de rajas is a mix grilled pasilla chiles and onions smothered with melted cheese, which also blankets the taco de calabacitas, a combination of tender marinated pork and stewed zucchini. The specialty of the house is a pasilla chile stuffed with grilled pork, roasted until it's just barely charred. Each item has its own texture and spices, and no two taste alike. Obviously, Julia knew a good thing when she tasted it.",5 star rating,Gourmet G.

12/4/2006,"San Francisco, CA","This place was quaint, and the tortillas were tasty. They were hand crafted and grilled before our eyes, so that was a nice touch. I had specifically stopped here on the way  down to LA because I had heard it was written up so many times, and it was Julia Child's favorite taco shop. However, this place couldn't hold a candle to most places in East LA or Hollywood taco shops. The meat was very chewy in my beef tacos, though flavorful. Also, it was ridiculously expensive. I got two beef tacos with avocado sauce and it was $5.50. Compare that to the $1.25 lengua tacos I had the other day that  were quite delicious in Holllywood. The service was slow and and borderline rude. Sure, I guess you are paying a premium for the hand crafted tacos and Santa Barbara rent prices, but  we were sorely disappointed that we drove 10 minutes out of our way to go to this place when we can get tastier, cheaper tacos at most places in LA. also, this meal was followed by a terrible stomachache, so this probably lowered my rating by another star.",2 star rating,Manali K.

11/1/2011,"Brooklyn, NY","This place is very delicious, and for a NYer who used to live in California, it was a great reintroduction to delicious Mexican food.  The tortillas are made fresh before your eyes, and that makes all the difference.  I got the carnitas tacos, and i was amazed at how barebones they were. Just tortilla and some pork chunks. My dining companion got some vegetarian thing which looked great and healthy, and it was good, but a bit on the bland side. We both got veggie tamales, however, and they were divine! Perfectly cooked, tender and soft with a great crema/beschemel sause. The sandia was as overly sweetened as ever, but delicious.  One major negative was that it took ages for our order to arrive.  The other bad thing is that I would have gladly given this place four stars had I not discovered El Bajio just up the road.

7/21/2008,"Westwood, CA","Since I can remember, my family and I have been coming here. It is probably the most satisfyingly simple food. This place is no frills. You wait in line, which depending on what day of the week it is and time can be nonexistent or really long. It moves fast though and the wait is always so worthwhile. My favorite thing to get is the quesadilla with chorizo. The chorizo is tasty without being overly spicy and the cheese is nice and mild as not to overpower. I always eat the same thing whenever I go. I think the important thing to remember when going here is that the food is very basic and inexpensive. It is not the most amazing food you will ever have, but if you except it for what it is, then it will never disappoint you. The owners remain the same and they make the food exactly the same way every time. I think this is the reason that so many people love this place so much (including Julia Child) because it manages to preserve its authentic charm despite growing tremendously in popularity over the years. It is delicious, especially the homemade tortillas that a little lady makes in the tiny kitchen. This place is also responsible for introducing me to horchata, a rice like drink that is served over ice and flavored with cinnamon and sugar. To date it is still the best one I've had, and I credit myself with being quite the horchata connoisseur.",5 star rating,Jillian K.
7/15/2009,"Denver, CO","I like La Super-Rica but be warned, as others have pointed out you need to order several tacos to have a meal since the portions are small.  The location is a bit sketchy so unless you want to use your leftover change to pick up a prostitute, I'd eat and run.",4 star rating,Jonathan S.

2/3/2010,"San Fernando, CA","I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I just can't give La Super-Rica 4 stars. For one, it is not a bad place, and is obviously a popular destination among Santa Barbarans; as evidenced by the long line that snakes out to the corner. The food was surprisingly affordable for being in Santa Barbara and they had a great selection of beer (they even had Dos Equis!). I ordered their Alambre de Pechuga, which I thought was going to be bursting with flavor. However, this was the reason it did not get four stars. My food was lacking a bit in flavor, it was greasy, and portions were still on the small side but you do get what you paid for. Also, they are cash only, which can be a pain-in-the-a** for plastic users like me. The place was more convenient to me rather than a favorite. Maybe it was the dish I ordered? Or were my expectations to high for this attempt at Mexican food in Santa Barbara? Well, they must be doing something right since they are loved by many Santa Barbarans that frequent this place.",3 star rating,Rodolfo S V.
9/2/2011,"Thousand Oaks, CA","I am NOT about this hype.  I did the waiting in line (45 min) and I would and have waited twice that long for good eats.  I will most definitely say the tortillas are worth some wait but what's in them or what you dunk them in is not.  The chicken breast meat was unmarinated and thrown on a fry grill and salted.  That is what a foodie would call gross.  Ahhh interesting note:  they did not use different tongs to flip raw chicken or other meat.  The pork had a very overwhelming spice (can't put my finger on it) and that was it.  It was not tasty and again not worth a wait.  The biggest disappointment were the beans that come with bacon in them.  How can you not make that taste delicious?  They had flavor, they had bacon in them for Christ-sake!  They weren't flavorful, worth a wait in line beans I'll tell you that.  Again, the tortillas were good.  The salsas were not my taste but the pico de gallo was flavorful.",2 star rating,Todd O.

6/2/2010,"Pasadena, CA","Good stuff here.  My taste buds for tacos are a little spoiled coming from LA and SD, so I'd like to think i know a good taco when it hits my tongue.  First off, any place that makes fresh tortillas, is a winner with me.  Once you have fresh hand made tortillas, the other stuff is like cardboard.  This place can get busy during the dinner rush so be prepared to wait about 20 min to get your order in.  But not to worry, once your order is in, it's out in front of you in no time.  The wait is b/c of people trying to make up their minds on what they want.  The menu is pretty straight forward.  I got the Super Rica Especial, had a roasted pepper stuffed with cheese, tasty pork, and 3 hand made tortillas ($6) and a can of coke ($1.25?).  What I really wanted was a corona, but I was borrowing cash so didn't want to burn money that wasn't really mine.  So on that note, it's a CASH only place, so be ready.  Park is on the street, but there's plenty of it, cause it's off the main strip of traffic.  Good stuff.  If i were a local, I'd be a regular here for sure.  It's got a good community vibe to it as well.",3 star rating,Mo m.
9/9/2011,"Chicago, IL","The reviews of this place are spot on so I'll just recap. We came because Lilly's taco's (higher reviews) was closed for the day. This taco joint is off the beaten path, essentially nowhere near state street. It's worth the trip because the ambiance is cool with a feeling of history. The hand made tortillas were fun to watch as you wait in line to order and worth a photo. Skip the steak taco as it was bland. And it's just steak on a tortilla. You have to use the salsa and order a side of guac just to call it a taco. The pork was a little better.  The chicken fajita was much better with fresh peppers and onions. The vegetable tamale and chilles rellonos were good also. Be sure to get that refreshing and seasonal watermelon drink.",4 star rating,d b.

2/22/2012,"Jupiter, FL","Great place for authentic Mexican food.  It's really just a notch above a roadside stand but it's really all about the food here.  The place has an almost cult following as the line stretches around the building every day.  The mistake I made was to order too little food. We gobbled down all of our items and didn't want to endure the 15-20 minute line to eat more. The food is fresh and delicious.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews. People are obviously going there with expectations too high. We're talking about mexican dishes here, not epicurean favorites. I think the long line for service probably turns people off.  The small dining area is cheap and has a awning over it. It gets hot in there. Who cares. The food rocks.",3 star rating,Daniel M.

(My bf gets all my tortillas.)  But, the #16 is my favorite too.  Also the  roasted chiles pasillas stuffed with cheese.  The chile rellenos are very good too.  The owner has let us try a couple of new dishes to give him feedback.  Good stuff.  Not your usual Mexican food.  If you want the usual go to Del Pueblo or Rose Cafe (yuck) one of those type of places.   Yes the wait is long.  I usually end up talking  to the out of towners, see a lot of the regulars and lots of friends.  One thing I don't like is the table snatchers.  These are the people who send in friends or family to snatch a table way before they are up to order.  That's not cool.  Wait your turn like the rest of us.  Usually works out though.",4 star rating,G.

10/11/2011,"San Leandro, CA",After watching Adam on Man Vs. Food going through the Pacific Coast Highway we decided we wanted to eat at the places he went too.  We tried the first place in Malibu and that was a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time!  Our stop was in Santa Barbra La Super Rica we were thinking about skipping this place since we did not enjoy the last place.  I am so glad that we did not skip this place!! We visited here on 10/10/2011 which was a Monday so there were no big lines!  As you walk in you can smell all the YUMMY food!! We were only going to order one thing and taste it first then order more if liked it since the last place was gross but as soon as we smelled and seen the food that idea went out the door!! It really is a hole in the wall and very easy to pass. There are no pictures of Man Vs. Food being here why? I don't know.. I also did not see that he only accepts cash so for those of us that use your debit card be ready to pay cash or check... Check? (what is that) lol  The good thing is that there was an ATM about a 4 min walk.  I ordered a chile relleno in white sauce WOW this was super good oh and a side of their homemade tortillas.  My husband ordered #16 what Adam had on the show now he liked it but I myself didn't really care for the marinated pork I guess it's suppose to be Alpastor but I have had way better. It did have a different flavor them your usual alpastor it was good but I like the alpastor I grew up with.  I also did not care for the salsa's they were good but for the food to be this great I expected more on the salsa's.  To drink we ordered agua de Jamaica this was so good it tasted like the Jamaica paletas!!

Heck, I'd say it exceeds its reputation. Its menu is innovative; they have unique and frequently-changing specials, like a tamal wrapped in banana leaf, stuffed with chicken and raisins. This is not some two-bit taco stand, though it is priced as though it is. Well, tacos are a touch expensive at $2.50 a pop. But still, yum.Today, I am salivating with the thought of my las rajas-- pasilla chilies, cheese, caramelized onions, and herbs on two tortillas.

I got there hoping to have great tacos and great food, as a Mexican I hold all places in high regards when they call themselves Mexican food. I was sadly disappointed. The meat was flavorless and the hand made tortillas were a great disappointment (yes they can be messed up if the masa isnt prepared properly).

It's quality food & it's fresh.  But damn, a 40 minute wait for food when there are only 10 people in front of you in line? Good thing we came prepared to wait. The portions here are small so be sure to order a few items. My favorite was the special pork & hominy in red chile sauce. It came with freshly made corn tortillas & had generous slices of avo on top. Also good was the gordita, which was a thick corn tortilla stuffed with spicy beans. Simple but great...and surprisingly spicy! We also ordered a side of guac & it was a huge scoop piled on 2 corn tortillas.

6/27/2011,"Santa Monica, CA","My bf and I were in Solvang for the weekend and made a stop in Santa Barbara for some romantic beach strolling and face stuffing.  My friend's bf is from SB and eats a lot (Hi Steph!) and out of her 75894375982 SB reviews I could only remember ""Julia Child's taco stand"" so I googled from the beach and headed over.  Easily spotted by the long ass line.  We waited about 40ish minutes behind the only latino in line.Even though we had stuffed ourselves at a post-wedding brunch only a few hours before, we ordered kind of a lot of food.  We had a #1, #2, #5, #12, #16, #17, and the special tacos de carne deshebrada (I think?).While we were waiting, we started with our drinks.  I just got a DC, but the bf got jamaica (which he ALWAYS orders when it's on the menu) and he, no joke, said it was the best jamaica of his life.  Coincidentally (or not so much), he is from Jamaica where jamaica is called sorrel.  Either way, it was awesome.I'd say the tacos were pretty good, but not as amazing as I was expecting, especially for $2.50.  (Have the $1 LA tacos spoiled me?  Maybe.)  The meat/chorizo was really plentiful, but not as juicy and tasty as I had hoped.  BUT the tortillas WERE super ricas as were the salsas.  The guac (#17) was unnecessary as the special tacos (definitely the best of the bunch) came with A LOT of this avocado/cream salsa that was WAY better than the guac, which I thought needed some salt and lime and maybe some cilantro.GET ANYTHING WITH MELTED CHEESE.  I kid you not, the best things we had were the #12 (basically chicken with melted cheese) and the #16 (chiles, chicken, and melted cheese).  My bf doesn't eat pork, so we originally weren't going to get the #16, but then the latino in front of us ordered ""una super rica especial de pollo"" (aka super rica special with chicken) and SCORE! Was it creepy that I listened to everything that he ordered to make sure that I got the ""good stuff?""  Maybe...but I'm glad I did :)",4 star rating,Melissa K.
3/17/2009,"San Luis Obispo, CA","You'll need to put your traditional (or ill conceived ""californian"") taco and mexican food notions aside.  This is probably the real taco.  The marinated meat is served on hand made (fresh!) corn tortillas.  I HATE corn tortillas... but I loved these.  That should give some testament to how truly delicious these are.If you're looking for more, you won't find it.  Meat & a tortilla.  That's it.  Get two and prepare to probably want a third but decide against it because the line is too long.  Don't beat yourself up over it though because you don't want to over do it on your first visit.Finish your Negra Modelo and dish to your friends about your latest accomplishment and enjoy the Santa Barbara weather as the Super Rica tacos sit contently in your tummy as your taste buds savor the memories.",5 star rating,Jesse B.

7/29/2012,"Upland, CA","Finally a legit taco joint that makes some seriously bomb mexican food. I am so over the traditional mexican restaurant that serves the same bland red rice with a ladle full of canned refried beans and cheese and a chefs tostada. Don't get me wrong its good but its not really authentic. My Dutch in laws could make the same meal that most mexican restaurants put out. These joints are easy to find and are everywhere.La Super-Rica is not one of these joints.  Its actually pretty hard to find come to think of it. You can easily drive by it and miss it if it wasn't for the long line crowding the sidewalk that flags you down.  I spoke with the owner of the place while he was taking my order. You know a mexican food place is going to be good when you see an old mexican man who is the owner actually taking your order and over seeing the whole kitchen. He told me how he moved here from Jalisco Mexico and started this restaurant using all his mothers recipes as well as using some of the local flavors to mix it up a little.Enough small talk, lets talk food.......I always hate when vegans review restaurants like this place and give it 3 stars but never order anything with meat on it. Your reviews are ridiculous. Uuuugghh this bugs me. Anyways we ordered about 6 different dishes and all of them were amazing in their own way. Take the #7 for example. Grilled Tri-Tip sliced with sautéed onions and bell peppers all mixed together with crispy pieces of bacon!!!!! Are you kidding me???? So good. This entree came with three tortillas. By the way all of their tortillas are fresh and made to order right in front of you. Another delicious treat was the #16 which was by far our favorite. Seasoned pork shredded and mixed together with grilled chili relleno peppers covered with cheese and placed on top of two tortillas. Along with these we ordered a side of guac, pork tacos and an unforgettable tamale stuffed with veggies and covered with melted queso. I can't say enough about this place. I truly believe they serve the best mexican food in the whole state of CA and I put there tacos second to none in flavor and authenticity. Cant wait to go back.",5 star rating,Joel R.

6/23/2008,"Brea, CA","The mixed reviews certainly scared me in light of all the heap thats been praised on La Super Rica.  So taco places should be rated based on the quality of the taco plain and simple.  Tortilla - home made and wonderful goodness. Salsa/sauce - spicy good but nothing life changing.  Meat - bland, not juicy and certainly no better than dozens if not hundreds of places you can find all over Southern California.  We were quite disappointed.  Mind you I waited in line for 20 minutes and ordered every single taco on the menu.  Well there are only 5 so not that big of a deal.  I'm not quite sure why all of the hype.  BTW - $2.50 for a taco is not cheap.  OK so not trying to ruin the party but the enchiladas special of the day was out of this world.  It was chicken, potatoes, mushroom covered in cheese and a white cream sauce.  I've never tasted anything like it before and would go back just for this.",2 star rating,Jerrold S.
8/16/2008,"San Diego, CA","I probably shouldn't be reviewing this place, because I never actually got to eat there. I read about it in a travel book, and my wife and I decided to eat there at about 1:30 pm one Saturday, while driving through Santa Barbara on vacation. If you're a foodie, and something is billed as ""Julia Child's favorite taco shop,"" you HAVE to go there, after all. First I tried calling for directions, since I don't know Santa Barbara well enough to drive my way through it blind, but no one answered the phone. Luckily, I found the street on which it was located, Milpas, while traveling through Santa Barbara on the 101 South (turn left as you get to the end of the off ramp and make your way around the roundabout, it's about 5 blocks down the street, heading North, on the right-hand side).When we got there, there were literally 70 people in line waiting to get tacos. We were far too hungry to stop and wade through that gauntlet, and sure that in our current states of mind and low blood sugar, we'd have to file for divorce after the experience of braving such a line. I'd really like to go there at some point in the future to offer a more comprehensive review, but I guess I have to be lucky enough to be synchronously hungry on a weekday, not during a mealtime, and magically in Santa Barbara, which is a rare confluence of variables. Eat there only if you like long lines, and don't expect anyone to answer the phone should you need to call for directions--they're simply too busy to talk with all the cooking that must be going on.",2 star rating,Christopher C.

The only thing that had some flavor was the stuffed tortilla filled w beans and the only flavor that had was HOT. Overly spicy w not enough flavor. Boo to this place.

8/31/2015,"Redwood City, CA","Honestly whoever is saying this place is good has never tasted real Mexican or Latino food before or can't handle real Latino flavor. I was raised in a Latino family and ate Latino food practically every day of my life and this is not Latino food. I also grew up in the Bay Area and tried many of the thousands of Latino restaurants they have - this being said, this is the worst Latino food I've eaten in my life. I'd rather eat Chipotle or Chevies. First of all, not many options. They don't even have enchiladas or flautas (taquitos)! Second, kid sized portions, meaning you have to buy 3+ of everything and making the bill way more expensive than other Mexican restaurants (unless they're more formal). Third, they do not know Mexican flavors or even how to cook/cut the meat. My taco meat, claimed to be carne asada, was definitely not that. It wasn't the right color (too light), texture (too soft), cut (too thin), spices (none), etc. Not to mention it was served to me cold and still pink (I'm honestly assuming it's frozen, processed meat from a grocery store). When I asked them to cook it more, it still did not taste right and they basically served me raw tortillas. The sauces are also very watered down and practically flavorless. I drowned my tacos in the salsa verde and it was hardly spicy. Good service but bad food! Spend your money at a real Mexican restaurant.",1 star rating,Elizabeth S.

9/12/2006,"Venice, CA","As far as cheap 'taco' joints go - this is a 4 star version. That said, this isn't a taco joint at all. In fact, one of the best things on the menu is Pozole - a deep red chili and pork broth full of hominy and stewed pieces of pork butt. Topped with some chopped raw onions, a couple slices of avocado and a wedge of lime. Genius. This is what those in the know get.The veggie tamale is pretty tasty also - as a reviewer below said, full of corn, onions, chayote, etc. with a big spoon of a creme sauce on top. I also like the simple dried beef tacos that come with a guacamole/tomatillo sauce. Their 'special' - the no. 16 or 17, not sure, is billed as a pasilla stuffed with pork and cheese, but turns out to be not a relleno but chopped peppers and pork with melted cheese on top. Good, but a bit of a disappointment.The lines are huge at lunch. Just get there before noon for sure. Or on a Sunday for a late breakfast.

The prices are super reasonable (cheap even) and the only bummer is that the word is out on this place and there is nearly always a line around the corner. Try to get there when they first open or at ""odd eating hours"" to get in fastest. There's a lot of seating in the back, and the churn is pretty high so you don't get stuck without a place to sit.

""Is it better or worse than La Super-Rica?"" is the question I usually ask when eating at other places on this street. That has a lot to say about this place. Not only do they handmake the tortillas, the quality of the food is superb and the prices are not too shabby. Yes, some people think of this place as over-rated and over-priced for what it is ($3/taco), but it's fresh, delicious, handmade. If you want dirt cheap taco, then you can walk down the street for something not as good, fresh and delicious. Anyone who comes to this town without trying La Super-Rica Especial (Cheese, pork, peppers on handmade tortillas) is definitely missing out. P.S. The line is always out the door - nuff said.",5 star rating,Teresa R.
6/20/2010,"San Francisco, CA","So we did a road trip from LA to SF and wanted to hit cheap eats along with the way.  First stop: La Super Rica.  Located in a rather unimpressive building, the first thing that caught my attention was the line out the door.  After about a half hour wait (and getting hungrier by the minute), I admittedly ordered much more than I should have.  For two of us, we had:- #16 Super Rica especial (roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese and marinated pork) - good with a nice kick- #4 Tacos de adobado (strips of marinated pork steak) - really juicy and full of hot, steaming strips of flavorful meat) - huge portion- Chorizo especial (basically sausage with quickly coagulating cheese) w/ fresh homemade tortillas - unexpectedly, this was my favorite.- Side of guacamole- Horchata (so yummy)This was a great place.  The homemade tortillas were the best part.  Overall, a bit on the pricy side (and very ""gringo"").  But definitely would hit it up again if I'm ever in SB.",4 star rating,F.

I waited in line for 20 minutes and  15 minutes for my order to be prepared. Pros; the food was not over-seasoned and the ingredients were fresh...again everything is made from scratch thus the long wait and oh it's a mom and pop business, grandma is making the tortillas as you watch =). Cons; plain food for those of us who like an occasional ""well"" seasoned/greasy taco =).,inconvenient  parking, don't accept plastic but will take checks, closed on Tuesdays.All in all, the food is decent but if you are used to the good 'ol Taco truck fixin'...the food will not impress you.",3 star rating,Kay K.

7/21/2009,"Brooklyn, NY","Armed with an endorsement from the late Julia Child, I made La Super Rica a mandatory stop during a recent trip down to SB. I am so thankful; I would call this place the real deal.          What joy it brings to walk up to the window of a taqueria and see someone hand pressing fresh tortillas. The salsa fresca is divine...so much so that we saw many abandoning the plastic ramekins and piling their portion onto a dinner plate. This food is simple unadorned Mexican, as it should be.           I also appreciated the laid-back vibe of this haunt. We went for an early dinner, skipping the crowds and cracked open a bottle of Schramsberg to cut through the richness of the meal. No one bats an eyelash at such an activity.            It may be sometime before I make it back to SB, and California for that matter, I will look back at this meal as the last time I had great Mexican food.",4 star rating,Lee T.
3/15/2010,"Monmouth, OR","Having lived in SB for a very long time I can attest to the accuracy of Lemonjelly I.'s review below, although I think it's a little (a lot, actually) harsh.  The line does stretch out the door, there really are few to no locals eating here at any given time, and the place is to some degree overhyped.  However, many Santa Barbarians know and appreciate the place, eat there occasionally, know the absurdity of suggesting that La Superica is some hole in the wall taco stand off the beaten track, and furthermore know that La Superica does not purport to serve the typical Sonoran food that most people are familiar with.  Mr. Gonzalez focuses on interesting flavor combinations and preparations derived from food eaten a bit further south.  I like the daily specials because they seem to use the most interesting ingredients, both in texture and taste.  Mr. Gonzalez really does know what he is doing, folks.  His food is authentic but original - just not the ""authentic"" of a taco shop.  Now that we live far away from home, we like to eat at La Superica - and Lily's, and (our favorite) La Simpatia in Guadalupe, whenever we visit.  The tortillas and pico de gallo are really excellent, the food is fresh, bright, and interesting.  Hey folks, be nice to the guy!  Mr. Gonzalez has put a lot of effort into introducing folks from the US to a different Mexican cuisine than what you traditionally see here.  He's not let success go to his head, and has not sacrificed quality as his fame and fortune have grown.",4 star rating,Jeff M.

12/5/2013,"Goleta, CA","My review is strictly for the food- the service was actually good. When I arrived at the place I was a little taken back by the $2.50 price for one taco. I am not stingy by any means, I actually enjoy spending  a little more for food provided that it is actually good. I ordered 2 asada, 2 adobada and 1 chorizo taco amounting to $13.59. I sat down and waited what seemed like 10-15 minutes for my food, and when I actually got my food I thought it was a good portion for the price I paid. I ate my tacos and was disappointed by the bland taste. I can honestly say the best component of the tacos was the tortilla as the meat was rather bland and mediocre at best. Inherently the tortilla is a part of the taco, but if it is the best part of the taco then in my opinion there's something wrongFrom eating these tacos, I would rather go to El Pollo Rico in old town Goleta where the tacos are only $1 and they have asada, al pastor, lengua, chicken, chile verde, carnitas and tripa tacos for $1.25. Albeit these tacos are significantly smaller but they pack quite the punch. Would I go back? Sure but not for the tacos.",2 star rating,Freddy B.

4/7/2008,"Los Angeles, CA","This is only our 3rd time here in the past couple of years but ever since the first visit, we always talk about this place.One of our favorites here is pozole which is their Sunday special and the previous time we made the mistake of coming on a Saturday looking for it so this time seemed like a special treat. At almost 2pm, the line wasn't as bad as we've seen it, however, it was moving as slowly as I remembered. That's my only pet peeve here. The line just moves extremely slow. So we ordered the pozole (it's a small bowl but it's filling so if you're getting other items, it can be shared) which comes full of tender pork pieces, hominy, shredded red cabbage, diced onions, sliced radish and slices of avocado as topping. There's really more meat and veggies than the broth. It also comes with a crispy tortilla. We also got the other Sunday special, the shredded beef taco (excellent!) which comes with creamy guacamole, then pork tacos, marinated chicken tacos with cheese, and a plate of guacamole which comes on 2 corn tortillas. Although we always order too much, we always love everything we get, usually a pork, chicken and beef dish. I think we order too much bc the plates/portions are small and by the time it's our turn to order, we're way hungrier than when we first got in line so our minds tell us to order more, better safe than sorry, or hungry in this case. Also, I don't know how much the daily specials are (they don't say on the specials board) but things add up pretty quickly (our total was $26.) so don't let the shack and the little ""inexpensive"" plates fool ya.

We've been trying all the Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara County, and La Super Rica remains one of our two favorites.Our favorite dishes: The suizas and the cazuela de queso are all good. They're basically delicious bowls of cheese.La Super Rica especial is my favorite. I seriously dig pork, chilis, and cheese. This dish puts them all together on top of fresh tortillas. When I move away from California, this will be the last dish I eat.The rajas, a cheese and chili dish, is amazing.The alambres seem to always come out a bit dry, but they're excellent if you need to cut the unrelenting cheesy deliciousness of another dish, e.g. the suizas. Of course, not everyone needs to do that.The frijoles Super Rica are a mostly normal bowl of beans. I've yet to try the tacos. The guacomole is solid, but good homemade guac is probably better.I don't know if it's technically allowed, but we've brought our own beer and sangria a couple times and had no issues.

Monkey don't even know what he ordered but it looks like a steak taco and he got a nice big portion. I ordered the #4 pork taco and two freaking order at $2.50 an order and it looks like a slap on the plates for dogs.  It didn't feel like it was done with love or care. The meat was lightly cooked, I can hear it oink.  I experience better than this even at Carl's Jr. Mexican selection was better than this. San Diego tacos are better than this and I even ate on the streets of Tijuana and it was not only cheap but tasted better than this.  I don't mind the price but I love food and I love food that taste good.  Maybe for a blind senior citizen, my plate would have been good for them.  Oh don't forget to take cash as they don't take card so I end up buying lunch with the last bit of cash I got.  And don't forget to tip as you might get looked down on if you don't.

My friend's tri-tip with 3 tortillas was served with tortillas on the bottom of the plate and tri-tip on top. Having lived in Mexico, neither of us saw that before. Disappointing. Tortillas were also spongy as if not fully cooked. My friend had a vegetarian tomale that he really liked.

I'm biased since I'm use to cabeza and lengua.  Now that I've tasted the food, it is very Americanized.  Flavors were very distinct,.nothing complex.  For the price, it's not that bad.  For the wait, totally not worth it, especially if you live in LA or OC or anywhere with an authentic Mexican community.  Horchata was too sweet, their special was a plate of charred bell peppers and cheese with pork.  I must admit that the quality of meat was good.  But the flavors were lacking.  The tamale pescado had no seasoning, no salt.  It was a big disappointment.",2 star rating,John F.
2/11/2012,"Sherman Oaks, CA","Night before our Wilco concert ordered the 16, the 13, pechuga quesadilla, the chicken enchilada special and the chile relleno.  Enchiladas were absolutely delicious and I will go back again and again if these stay on the menu.  The guacamole needed salt, lime and hot sauce and I will probably skip next time.  The chicken thing my fiancee ordered I didn't try (boring) and the Especial was good though a little skimpy on the pork.  The chile relleno is what put me over the top...too creamy.  Went on a Thursday night at 7 PM and the wait was still around 30 minutes but far better than the two plus hours we waited for My Morning Jacket....never again on a Saturday...",4 star rating,Kristin K.

There was three of us and we ordered the special, the taco with tri tip in it, the guacamole and queso. We basically ordered everything the person behind us in line told us to since she was a regular. It was all delicious.

10/30/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","A lot of reviews already, so I'm just gonna get down and dirty...Arrived Saturday afternoon @ 12:30. there was a line, but we waited all of 20 minutes.The food: Just okay. We ordered the #16 Super Rica Especial, #7 tri-tip, #12 chicken pechuga and vegetable tamale. I don't eat pork, but I was told the #16 special was really good. the #12 chicken looked really good, but it was a pounded chicken breast cutlet sandwiched between 2 corn tortillas held together with cheese; basically a chicken bread quesedilla. Like other have said, the #7 is forgettable. the tri-tip was tough, and although cooked with onions and green bell pepers, it was kind of bland. It needed a lot more flavor. Even adding salsa and salt to it didn't imporove it much. Pass on it. the vegetable tamale is decent ,but I like my friend's sister's tamales much much better. It had a white cream sauce on it that didn't add anything to it at all, plus it was also a little bland but fresh. The best thing we had had to be the Fresh corn tortillas.  the sandia and jamica agua frescas were good too. 3.5 starsThe service: Really nice and friendly.  4 stars.The ambiance: not much to say about it. It's a taco stand-ish. A little better than most though. 3.5 stars. The price: I think it's a little pricy for what you get compared to most taco shops I've been to, and that's a lot of taco shops.  The #16, #7, #12, vegetable tamale and 3 small agua frescas came out to over $30. Seriously? $10/pp at a taco shop??? Steeeeeeeeep! 2 starsOverall, 3 stars. I know it's a chain, but I like King taco in L.A. better.  Sorry Santa Barbara I heard the new place across the street that starts with the letter ""C""  has better tasting food, but I haven't hit it yet.",3 star rating,Rceli A.

My family has been dinning here for 20+ years, and let me tell ya, it's always a pleasure to take someone new with us each time we go. To truly appreciate this place, you need to order things that compliment each other and you have to, guess what??? BE CREATIVE...... I know its hard with all of you Chipotle and Olive Garden lovers out there. Its not Traditional Mexican food. Its delicious because its fresh, and not blatantly over seasoned to cover up its poor quality. Try combining things, and trust me, you will create tastes you've only dreamed of elsewhere. Oh and as for the line, this isn't fast food. So have some patience. Other people like food too, so unfortunately, you'll have to wait occasionally. Its worth it.",5 star rating,Patrick C.

4/28/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love La-Superica! I highly recommend getting their specials if you go - just getting a taco on the regular menu will not amaze you. What's so great on their rotating specials menus is the Sopes on Tuesday, the Enchiladas on Thursday, and if you aren't allergic to shellfish, the seafood tamales on the weekend (can't remember when I saw that).  Skip the #13 which is a chile cheese dip...   We love the dive atmosphere, the homemade tortillas, and the tradition of standing in line like it's the Soup Nazi's kitchen.  Enjoy!  It's not typical Mexican food - they use french influenced techniques using cream...yum!  But like I said, you'll find this in their SPECIALS menu - you won't be disappointed with those!",4 star rating,Krista E.

Figure on two orders of tacos per person, minimum. Great food. Highly recommended.",4 star rating,David H.
8/15/2011,"Brea, CA","At 1:45pm on Friday, the line was quite long.  The wait was over 30 minutes long but I guess that was not too bad considering the popularity of this place.  For such a small Mexican restaurant, the menu is quite extensive.  Good thing I already knew what I wanted based on the yelp reviews I've read.  I decided to get Tacos de Adobado and Tamal de Verduras.  BF chose Tacos de Bistec and Tacos de Chuleta.  As we were waiting to place our order, we saw one of their cook pressing/shaping tortillas and grilling them.  I don't think I've ever had fresh handmade tortillas in restaurants (in California) before.  We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  Including the waiting time, it took a little over an hour before we actually got our food.  That said if you're super hungry and want food immediately, this restaurant is not for you.Now the food.  The tortilla was very good.  I mean, really good.  The texture was delightfully soft and chewy - like a delicate steamed bun.  I didn't know tortillas could have that kind of texture.  Compared to the wonderful tortilla, the meat filling was somewhat disappointing.  I liked how the meat pieces were chunkier than typical tacos but the flavor was just average.  Salsa was decent.  I liked the tomatillo based salsa which had mild and citrus flavor.  If not for the tortilla, their tacos are average at best.  Tamal de Verduras on the other hand was a different story.  I usually don't like fresh tamales (because of the smell) and I don't really like vegetables very much but I really enjoyed their vegetable tamales.  Usually, fresh tamales have strong corn smell that I'm not fond of but their tamales had very mild and delicately sweet aroma of corn.  Some may find the dish a bit too sweet because of the cream sauce but the flavor was just right for me.  I would definitely come back and wait in line for this dish.",4 star rating,Kumi K.
2/8/2015,"Manhattan, NY","We had the Super-Rica special #16, tamales de verdures, and steak taco. The tortillas are all made fresh in front of your eyes, and are a different breed of tortilla than anything you can get commercially. Truly spectacular. The taco wasn't exciting (the meat was good quality, but it was basically just steak and tortilla), but the tamale and pork/chile combo were both unexpected combinations of tastes and ingredients and were beyond delicious.  I'm not sure it would merit over an hour wait, but our 20 minute wait at 2:30pm was definitely worth it.

We have been here a few times before and haven't had the most excellent experience...but we always want to give this 'raved-about' taco spot, one more chance. I feel like I always order the same thing, Pechugas Suiza (chicken quesadilla/taco with cheese), mainly because of the fact that I don't eat red meat and that is prevalent on their menu. I also ordered the Rajas taco. Food comes after a bit and I can't see how it took so long, given the messiness of the items (I'm not picky about that by the way...just saying). The flavor is good! There was even a bit of that delicious burnt cheese on the Suiza. I began to feel way too 'over cheesed' though. In fact, I'm still too cheesy. Ugh.

8/31/2011,"San Francisco, CA","I had discovered the joys of La Super-Rica 2 years ago on a trip through Santa Barbara wine country. Needless to say, when the opportunity to visit the same area presented itself recently, I jumped at the chance to eat here again. A couple Fridays ago, my boyfriend and I hit it at about 9:15 pm and the line was still out the door. It moved rather quickly, but it does help to get your beer immediately so you can enjoy it while you wait for the food. Remember to bring cash - there's a hard-to-find Wells Fargo ATM a couple miles up in the Rite-Aid parking lot if you forget.The menu is so broad that sometimes a long line is a good thing. Since it was so late we only ordered a few things to share (but of course, extra hand-pressed tortillas). The tacos de costilla were good but the steak was a little bland. I had to drown it in some tomatillo salsa to get some flavor. The gorditas de frijoles sure made up for that though - the heat builds up slowly until your mouth is in flames! Thank Christ for that beer ;) Anyway, the tacos de adobado were the clear winners for us. The pork strips were seasoned perfectly and there was a lot of them! I do wish they had some style of carnitas but what they do have is really tasty. The dude behind the counter gave me some extra limes for my beer too. Muchas gracias!

10/7/2010,"Goleta, CA","LA SUPER RICA?!?! more like... LA SUPER RIP-OFF!!!This place was such an enormous disappointment. By the looks of the restaurant you would think it was an authentic mexican restaurant and a humble one at that. But after ordering sopes, two tacos and a drink, and realizing our total had come to 19.28!! We knew that this place was a little more than deceiving. AND, they dont take cards of any kind, so after ordering our food, we had to walk and additional 2 blocks to the atm down the street, just to pay for the over-priced meal!! So we get back and pay and are informed that our food is ready and we go to the pick up window to see two tiny tacos and 3 baby sopes. When i order tacos and they come to $20, Im expecting them to be accompanied by at least some sides, or have multiple tacos per plate, but nope, not at super rica. The horchata we ordered was a ""large""...16oz for over 2 dollars?!?! One of my tacos was a chile con queso, and it tasted exactly like KFC's gravy...turn off?... I was EXTREMELY surprised to see that most of the customers there seemed to be regulars, as I know that I will NEVER set foot in that establishment again.

Like another reviewer said - it's a taco stand, and you ""build your own"", just like in Mexico...if you know how to build it, it will be fabulous - pile on their terrific pico, salas, chopped onions, cilantro, and you will not be disapointed....will it change your life? No. Will the heavens part? No. Will you have a damn tasty taco and leave feeling happy and satiated? YES! And, that my friends is a great taco stand's purpose, thankuverymuch. Also:~The tortillas are the freshest you'll have ANYwhere.~The Chilaquiles are DE-frickin-licious!! Only served on Mondays, though..unless they changed it from last time we were there.~ #16 is one of the best things on the menu (pork, pasilla peppers, chorizo)- add pico de gallo and the green salsa for some serious spicy deliciousness. I always order a #16- in my opinion, it's the best thing on the menu, other than the Chilaquiles. Wash it down with a Pacifico...your mouth will be on fire but you will not care. yuuuu-um.~Although I'm not a horchata person, my husband is and he looves SR's horchata!Wouldv'e given SR 5 stars, no doubt,  but I must admit I've noticed a change in their spicing, at least on the #16 in recent years...it is still EXCELLENt, but not as good/spicy as it used to be..I have to say, I love you guys, but what's up with that?Still an awesome place, and worth the lines, in my opinion (although since we go at odd times, I don't think I've ever waited more than twenty min..)",4 star rating,Kate B.

I like everything about this place except for the line you have to wait in and that I can't go here often. I can't blame them for having a line. A lot of really good places are really popular. The food was great! I had sopes which were freshly made and delicious and I also had some tacos and tried some enchiladas (remember I went twice, I didn't eat this all at once). Their food is different, it is like other taco shop food, but with fresher, more vibrant flavors. I found the guy taking orders to be really helpful. Is it worth it to wait in line and possibly drive out of your way? That depends on you. It depends on whether you eat because you have to or go out of your way to eat something really good and different. If you do the latter then I think you will like it here.",4 star rating,Jason T.

5/3/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","Is it legal to have this much cheese in one place? Oh man... this place. It's not for the faint of heart. I was super excited about this place because my friend raved about how amazing the corn tortillas were. In my head, I'm like ""youdunnome! corn tortillas are the worst! so dry, so thick."" nah.. I stand corrected. This place makes it amazing. The corn tortilla is very very fresh - they make it right there in fact. It's light, not grainy. It was so easy to eat! As happy as I was with the tortilla, BAM! My friend didn't tell me the most amazing part are all the specials they have. I saw them laying out the little plastic bowls in the kitchen. I saw a cook hold a little pot, squishing it around before he poured out a very thick and resistant concoction. Wallah! #25! Guess those 3 bowls each had that gooey substance, and they were all to be a part of me soon - and seriously a part of me like straight to my hips business.I found out all that stuff going on was cheese! That made the main dishes. Sure they'd alter it and flavor it up with meat (bacon, chorizo) or veggies (tomato), but holy sh*t it was a bowl of thick thick cheese that solidifies if you don't put it away fast enough. Of all the 3, I enjoyed the cheese with tomato the most (#16). I liked the heavy cheese + acid balance. There was also a bit of soup (I'm assuming it's butter) on top of the cheese that just made for a nice pre-game before slapping all that goodness onto a corn tortilla. The chorizo (#13) was my next fave because I just like chorizo, and it's so hard to find. It was the same concept - cheese & an ingredient. The bacon (#14 tocino) just was too much for me. It had a really really strong smokey flavor and it drowned out the cheese which became all texture. You actually see the bacon grease solidify in the bowl, and that's when I regretted my cheese x3 decision... Great concept, but one especial is enough for one trip, I think (I'm Asian. Factor in the lactose biz).We also got the Pasole - special of the day which had stewed pork, hominy, red cabbage, onion, & crispy tortilla - because we needed something normal to counter all the fat we were digesting. Great choice. It had vegetables, which made me amazingly (surprisingly) happy. It's a stew-kinda dish. I really liked the broth - rich, developed, but with subtle flavor. Mix that soup with the raw onions and yumm... what a great moment. It tasted even better with a crispy tortilla crunch. I'd definitely recommend it.I had to wait a bit, but it was worth an experience. The staff is extremely nice - it's a small family establishment. This place is intense (food-wise, just get 1-2 especials at a time), but they're great for what/who they are. Divey hole in the way with solid food near the beach? Check. Every coast has one... this is it for SB.PS. Not a fan of the salsa bar. Limited options (3 - 2 salsas & one pico de gallo) and not very unique, or 'wow yeah I want this in my taco'. I did enjoy the green sauce though because it was very limey & acidic, which was just what I needed to go with the fat I ate.",4 star rating,Jenny C.

It's a total hole in the wall place and at meal times the line goes out the door and down the sidewalk so you know it's good.

So I walked a couple blocks to a ATM and came back.  I ordered two steak tacos, and took a seat. I was really looking forward to tasting the homemade tortillas.  I was so disappointed :0(  The taste of the tortillas was great but, they were sope size, not taco size and the meat was bland. I took a look around and most people seemed to be students or tourists. I was so bummed and still hungry. I have never had such tiny, bland tacos.

Only thing that wasn't dry was the chorizo taco.  ( It would be an amazing accomplishment to make chorizo dry!)   Nothing else on the tacos  (onions,cilantro? )  Salsa's were ok, nothing special.  I usually love hand made tortillas but these were overly bready and seemed a bit undercooked.  One smallish taco $2.50!!!  Anyone who gives this place a high rating I have 3 words for you El Gran Burrito (los angeles)  or basically any taco truck or stand in L.A.It's a problem when the only people eating the food are not from where the food comes from and that theory holds up here.So sad as I wanted to love this place!  Especially after waiting for 25min in line and another 15 for the food at 3pm on a Sunday.",1 star rating,Talley S.
1/18/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","What a disappointment.  The only thing special about this place in my mind is the wait and the cost.  I went at 3:00pm on a Sunday, waited 20 minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get my two tacos.  Although there is a list of different tacos, the choice is actually quite limited, and no customizations allowed.  For example, there's a taco with bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions, but if you can't eat peppers, you're out of luck.  Order something else.  I felt that the cost is about double what it should be.It would have all been worth it if the food was exceptional.  It isn't.  The tortillas were good, the chicken was fine, but it was in no way better than the tacos I get at a dozen different places in L.A.  Maybe the pork or steak is better, maybe you will have a divine experience if you get the tacos loaded up with peppers or chiles, but what I had was truly mediocre.  When combined with all the other factors, all I can say about Super-Rica is that I have now been there.",1 star rating,Robert S.

They all have been good but not outstanding. In my view the meat/poultry is in need of a little more seasoning.

4/23/2009,"Denver, CO",I grew up on La Super-Rica. Whenever I go home it's one of the first places I go. I actually did not know Julia Child said anything about this amazing Taco stand. I do know whenever my family came to visit from the UK it was one of their first requests (as was In N Out). The tortillas are yummy and super fresh-they make them on the spot. Go on Mondays for the amazing chilequiles.,5 star rating,Amanda T.
9/15/2010,"Los Angeles, CA",This place is great mexican food for white people who are afraid to eat mexican food. The quality of the meat is very high but they don't really do much to add to the flavor.,3 star rating,ben c.
5/22/2012,"Goleta, CA","I have eaten here once and I was not very impressed. The tortillas were really fresh but the meat was so so. I guess part of the problem was that it took over half an hour to get my food and when it showed up it was kinda anticlimatic. everything was very plain and not very authentic.If you want good mexican try los agaves down the street- same prices with WAY better food. Lilly's is good too, and much faster and cheaper than super rica",3 star rating,Alex M.
3/1/2005,"San Francisco, CA",This little hole in the wall taqueria is written about in all the travel magazines.  I'm no connoiseur of Mexican food but it was the most authentic I've had in SB. Need a car to get to.  Some may say it's overrated...but when a little shack receives so much publicity...aren't you a little curious?,4 star rating,Tanger T.
12/30/2011,"Glendora, CA","This was an impromptu stop for lunch today as we drove down the coast.  Great food, great service, and fun experience.  Like others have said -- there's a line (our wait was about 30 minutes), the menu is on a board once you get into the shop (so be able to make somewhat quick decisions), and the owner who takes the orders is very helpful in answering questions and making recommendations.  There is no sense of being rushed even though you're conscious of the long line behind you.  Yes, they run out of things. Yes, the specials are particularly notable.  But, so's the guacamole, the horchata, and the #16!  The place is clean, family friendly (except for the wait), and one-of-a-kind.  Enjoy!",4 star rating,A.

12/13/2010,"Pleasant Hill, CA","When you live in Santa Barbara, there's good Mexican grub on almost every block. But you have to wait in line at La Super Rica when friend or family foodies come to town. Sure, Super Cuca's is great, Los Arroyos has top-notch burritos and Lilly's tacos are unmatched, but did Julia Child wax poetic about them? No. So get in line, and spend $25 on a dozen items. Just grab two beers on the front end.",4 star rating,Tim O.
3/3/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Seriously the best tortillas and salsa you'll ever eat! When I ate meat, I loved their sopas. Lots of great reviews about La Super Rica so you get the drift they have amazing food. I REALLY wish they could expand and create more seating to reduce lines. It's what keeps us away more often than not. I'd love to visit more but we just can't stand in line with four children for 30 minutes. 5 star food for sure!!! It's worth the cost and can be worth the wait if you don't have small children (or lots of active children).",5 star rating,Phoebe D.
12/17/2006,"Burlingame, CA",I love this place.  La Super-Rica is a great place to go if you want authentic homemade corn tortillas and yummy mouthwatering guacomole.  I promise you will not find a better place for Horchata except for Spain.  It is not a fancy place but is a great place to go if you are on a budget.  There is usually always a line out the door to order food which speaks of how great the food is.,5 star rating,Connie P.

2/21/2010,"Torrance, CA","My advice is to avoid anything with meat cooked on the griddle. The high volume of customers means that the meat is cooked for too long at too low a temperature. It gets dry that way and isn't served hot enough. Good news is that everything else lives up to the hype, so turn off the Gring-o-meter and bring plenty of cash.",4 star rating,Raphael Aizan S.
2/6/2011,"San Francisco, CA","This is one of the best taco stands I have been to in the US.  On my last visit, I had the posole (A pork and hominy soup) and it was great. The chile con queso was also great.",5 star rating,Alan B.
3/12/2011,"Los Angeles, CA","It's like waiting in-line for Space Mountain without a FastPass, but the pay off is so worth it. It's not often that you stand in front of Mexican Fast Food place and the taco is not the star of the show. The Tortillas are handmade, in front of you, the beef, pork and chicken is grilled in front of you, right there, but the payoff is the care and effort each taco and plate is served with, you'd think Thomas Keller is behind the counter, hairnet and all.",5 star rating,George M.
2/22/2012,"Costa Mesa, CA","This place has great and creative food -- way better than average. Not my absolute favorite, but very very good. The main downfall of Super-Rica is its popularity. It is not uncommon to wait 45 minutes for a seat at this fast-food taqueria, which is pretty outrageous. I would eat there much more often if it wasn't for the wait. I guess that explains it, doesn't it?",4 star rating,Robert Scott T.
7/24/2011,"San Francisco, CA","Holy freakin cow.  All the tacos you've had to this point in your life weren't this tasty or interesting. Makes everything else seem like taco bell.  Meat on tortillas. No fish. Just meat. On tortillas. Homemade tortillas, pressed and cooked before your very eyes. They have quesadillas too... and a bacon-cheese-taco... and some daily specials like enchiladas (enchiladas are TOP DELICIOUS). You'll leave feeling like you found something special. Don't forget the salsa bar tho. Cuz otherwise meat and tortillas can be dry.",4 star rating,Zachary L.
