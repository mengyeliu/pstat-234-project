5/25/2021,"San Francisco, CA","even on a Monday night, this place was packed. We got there 7:00 and the wait for two was about a little less than an hour. it's a cold wait on the pier because of the wind so don't forget to bring a jacket!! after a long wait, we got seated right at the railing next to the water. what a beautiful view especially as the sun was setting over the water. the lights were reflected and it was truly a beautiful sightI ordered the cioppino and my friend ordered the abalone. It came out promptly - nice and hot. I've never had abalone but when I tried it I really enjoyed it. The cioppino comes in a bread bowl which got a bit soggy. I wish they would've used something that didn't get as soft or even toasted it a bit. It comes with crab, clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallop. As a seafood lover, I really appreciated this. The broth was nice and flavorful but there just wasn't enough of it (or perhaps the bread soaked it up...) Honestly I just don't think a bread bowl is the best vessel for cioppino... Large portion though - I couldn't finish and took it togoBTW they use paper straws here and I personally hate them - would rather just have no straw honestly. Good service and nice ambiance. Perhaps a bit pricy though. They have a takeout window which is much faster and they even have some picnic tables you can sit at right by the water",4 star rating,Stephanie N.
5/24/2021,"Anderson, IN","We stopped in Santa Barbara for lunch on our trip to Santa Ynez.   We wanted to eat in the water and walk a bit so this was the ideal spot.   We arrived at 11, just as they opened and found a table outside.   They have full service seating outside, full service seating inside, and a take out window with picnic tables on the deck.   The seating is limited everywhere. We both ordered the crab chowder which was good but not hot enough.  We also both got the Oysters Rockefeller which I would NOTt recommend.  The oysters themselves were wonderful but they were topped by a precooked spinach mush with a drizzle of sauce on top.   They weren't baked which is a huge no-no for me. Go for the view.   Once.",4 star rating,Susie R.
5/12/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Came up on a weekend to finally try some uni and my friend who moved here suggested SBSC. Instead of the dine-in option we chose to go to the take out side and just squat at one of the picnic tables on the wharf. The process for that is a little disorganized. The menu is in front and they have a QR code but you still have to hover around to get it and you won't see their specials/oysters of the day until you get up there. Their regular menu options are pretty expansive and besides the uni the windy conditions called for their clam chowder. *Their chowder has bacon* which is: 1) GREAT! 2) authentic and 3) highlighted on their menu. I hadn't had a bread bowl in a while so I got it in a bread bowl.They give you a number and wait for your number to be called-the order window is the pick up window as well so there's some more disorganization there and I feel bad because I'm sure the guy's voice was sore after the day was over.The chowder was great and I ate the entire thing-even after I had three uni covered scallops that popped out even more because of the blood orange. Maybe next time, dine-in will be a better option.",4 star rating,Ted C.
5/23/2021,"Pomona, CA","Fresh seafood right on the pier so you can really enjoy the ocean. We had the clam chowder in a bowl with bread on the side, crab cakes with side of onion rings, and a lobster roll with side of onion rings. Everything tasted delicious and service was great, even when we were seated outside with our dog. Highly recommend coming out here for the good food and view.FYI, no fish and chips here!",5 star rating,Kathy H.
5/17/2021,"Santa Monica, CA","As a tourist, I don't know if this is considered a tourist trap. If so, sign me up! Great seafood on the pier at reasonable prices.If you don't want to wait, I recommend arriving soon after they open (especially on weekends). There's both restaurant seating as well as a takeout window. If you do the takeout window, there's a good number of picnic tables that you can sit at. Regardless of your choice, there's likely going to be a line of folks ahead of you and at least an hour minute wait.Food-wise, I've tried the box crab, uni, and fried seafood plate. If they have the uni, get it!! At under thirty dollars, its a steal for the amount of fresh, umami uni you get. The box crab is fresh and super flavorful. If you dine in, they'll even bring out a live crab to show you what it looks like. The fried seafood is also tasty, with plump pieces fried to perfection.Make sure you confirm with your waiter what you're ordering. Once, I ordered the rock crab and the server misheard me and brought out a 2.5 lb box crab. I didn't realize it until I got the check, resulting in a $40 difference between what I was expecting to pay and what I had to pay. Very unfortunate, but luckily I was able to absorb that cost.Also, the pier gets very very windy so bring a windbreaker! By the end of our meal when we dined in, I was chilled to the bone and immediately had to go take an hour long hot shower (no lie).",5 star rating,Angela C.
5/3/2021,"Berkeley, CA",3.5 to 4 for the seafoodCame here with my parents for a quick snack (lol) before dinner. I wasn't wowed by their seafood and was moderately underwhelmed by the quality & quantity of the seafood I had for the price. Seafood isn't bad- not the freshest I've had.Worth a try? SureWill I personally be coming back? Don't think soCool views though!,4 star rating,Tiffany F.
4/30/2021,"San Francisco, CA",Sooo good! We went on a Saturday for lunch just before 11 and to our surprise there was a long line. Is getting there early was a good idea because we got seated just as they opened and didn't have to wait long for a table. My ratings below:* Clam chowder 4/5 - served with crackers and was very good* Box crab 5/5 - my first time trying this and ordered because my fellow yelpers recommended this. It's served with onion rings and melted butter. Crab crackers and scissors provided for your convenience.* Lobster roll 4/5 - served with onion rings and coleslaw. They did not skimp on the lobster! Very good!* Bloody Mary 3/5 - I've had better. It was lacking picked toppings! * Staff 4/5 - attentive and friendlyBring a jacket! It gets windy out on the pier. Will come back for sure!,4 star rating,Nyla K.
4/11/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Great spot right at the end of the wharf. Everything we ordered tasted sooo fresh and delicious. We got the cioppino which had so much seafood in it - the huge crab legs and scallops were amazing. My boyfriend had the lobster roll, also yummy and generously stuffed. Finally we had the crab cakes that were perfect with the smoky aioli.Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Jade V.
5/11/2021,"Anaheim, CA","The perfect location for the ideal get away. Located at the end of Stearn's Wharf anticipation builds with each step on this wooden built pier. There's a sign in sheet to put your name down with a preference of inside or outside. I would recommend outside as the inside is drafty and cold. An open kitchen the cooks work relentlessly preparing order after order. We had the: Shrimp Ceviche 4/5 a bountiful serving with chips. Bisque of the day in a bread bowl 5/5. The day's basques was crab. Creamy and delightful. I wouldn't get the bread bowl and opt for a cup instead. Lobster Roll 4/5. Lots of lobster and nicely flavored. The roll, which is more of a large thick slice of bread, didn't compliment the lobster contents. The bread was too dry and tough. The plate included coleslaw and two onion rings which were both very good. You can also order at a take out window to eat at picnic tables.",4 star rating,Screaming M.
4/13/2021,"San Diego, CA","I've gone here 3 times and two times was in my last trip. If you want a fancy dinner this is not your place but if your are craving some good food than this is your place!  I came here on a girls trip in October and I think most of us got the Lobster roll and we got some apps and a bottle of wine and we were all in heaven. So when I brought my husband here last week I knew I was getting the lobster roll again! It was a tad more crowded now then it was in October so we had to wait like 35 min on a Tuesday around 2 pm. My husband got the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and I had to have a taste! My god the best lobster bisque I have ever had! I also lived Newport, RI and had a plethora of lobster bisques there and hands down by a long shot theirs is better! So later that night we were like both day dreaming of lobster bisque and the next morning still talking about the bisque. We had to go back! So after doing some wineries on Wednesday we went back for the beloved lobster bisque. Well it was later now probably around 6 now and there was a really long wait but thankfully the side window was open. We stood in that line for probably 20 min and had hour bisque in a bread bowl at the picnic tables. Yup it was just how we imagined it. I'm actually really upset I didn't take a photo of the bread bowls! I think I was craving it so much taking a second to take a pic didn't cross my mind! Can't wait to go back to Santa Barbara and definitely will be back here! They are also dog friendly and the waiter brought my dog her own water bowl!",5 star rating,Caitlin B.
4/12/2021,"San Francisco, CA","One bite of the uni and I swear I could hear the waves of the ocean with how fresh it was. Well, I could actually hear the waves as we ate it on the convenient benches on the pier but you know what I mean! Fantastic flavor with everything we tried - the price Is well worth it considering the variety of fresh local seafood they offer.Go big on the uni, spiny lobster, and oysters. Local goodies that are freshest in areas like Santa Barbara! You'll have to walk all the way at the end of the pier, but the treasure you'll find will be gorgeous, fresh,  seafood!",5 star rating,Tony P.
3/17/2021,"Orange County, CA","If you are trying to have an exemplar meal with one hell of a view from the Santa Barbara pier, Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is the place to be. Nothing beats noshing on fresh local seafood on a pier, am I right? Sure, it is touristy and cliché but people do it for a reason -- it makes for a wonderful lunchtime experience. Santa Barbara Shellfish Company ticks all of the boxes. The service is equally friendly as they are efficient, the seafood is top notch, and the prices are actually quite reasonable considering the setting and locale. Oh - and their Beer options on draft are noteworthy. Beer geeks will want for nothing, It would be remiss of me to not bring up how creamy and delectable their Bacon infused Clam Chowder is. Everyone at the table agreed it was a damn fine way to kick off lunch on a cooler, breezy Santa Barbara afternoon. Stick with just a cup, this stuff is filling and because it is so appetizing it would be scarily easy to over eat. I would argue the best value proposition on available - at least the day I visited - would be the local Steamed Box Crab at $22.00. You get a pair of huge meat laden Claws, plump Legs, and do yourself a favor and ask for a second ramekin of Clarified Butter because you will need it. There is also a very good Cole Slaw side that you will largely ignore. Sure, this isn't for date food -- things will get messy -- but live a little, you will be glad you did. Other favorites at the table included the Lobster Roll, Crab Cakes, and Clam Linguini. There was not a single complaint registered throughout the course of the meal. How could there be with that view? Free parking for the first 90 minutes. Bookmark this one.",4 star rating,Aaron E.
4/7/2021,"San Fernando Valley, CA","Came here last Saturday and was excited to try the food here. It was a windy day which made the eating experience a bit rough. We ordered the lobster roll with onion rings, fried calamari, oysters, shrimp, and scallops, and a cup of New England Style Clam Chowder. The line to order food from the side window was a bit long and slow. We waited about 30 minutes just to order, then another 10 for the food. Once we got the food, it looked and smelled amazing. They were generous with the lobster amount in the lobster roll but the bun could have used more butter and toasting. The fried calamari, oysters, shrimp and scallops were perfect. Onion rings were also crispy and large, but with the wind, the fried breading would fly away as we bit into them. Clam chowder tasted decently fresh but it got cold quickly due to the wind.Hopefully next time we can eat when it's less windy and less of a wait!",4 star rating,Cze T.
3/11/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Located at the end of Stearns Wharf. In covid times they have outdoor dining with outdoor heaters which was very helpful for a nighttime dinner by the water. Our waiter Johnny was very helpful with navigating the menu. Parking is available right outside the restaurant. 2 lb Box crab special [5 stars] *****Fun experience cracking the crab, savory and buttery meat. Huge portion. Came with two giant onion rings.Lobster pasta [3 stars] ***Felt like the crab was more fresh than the lobster. The pasta itself was a little on the bland side. Came with a large piece of bread.",5 star rating,Tiffany A.
3/5/2021,"Diamond Bar, CA","Clam chowder bowl was surprisingly good!  Soup was chunky with lots of clams and potatoes, and the bread was soft and fresh, unlike the dry, hard bread usually used for bread bowls (cough Panera).There's an outdoor dining area sort of tucked behind the restaurant, right next to the water.  It was pretty cold and windy that night but the seats along the wall had overhead heaters that kept us toasty and warm.Service not particularly friendly, but fast and efficient.Parking on the pier is abundant and the first 90 min are free (although the creaking and rattling of tires over the old wood is pretty nerve-wracking, leaves you wondering if your car is going to be the last straw).",5 star rating,Deborah C.
5/23/2021,"San Diego, CA","I went here with my boyfriend as a celebration for who knows what, but we did! With COVID-19 precautions, we had to order take-out, so maybe the quality was lower because of that. We got the garlic baked clams, which were really good on paper, but it did not live up to my expectations. They were small and too salty for my liking, also it was kinda cold. Which we attribute to it being take-out but it was not great. We also got the seafood cioppino in a bread bowl. This was not very flavorful and quite watery. There was also barely any seafood in ours, which I am not sure is just ours or others as well. It could have been better, and I have had better so for a place that specializes in seafood -- this was not it. I don't think I would return, unless the food was a lot better without COVID-19 restrictions.",2 star rating,Kaithlyn D.
4/13/2021,"Sunnyvale, CA","I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars! We were in town with my fiancé's family, and everyone was craving seafood. We had a very mixed experience, and I think we'd have to go back for another visit I order to update this review. Because of Covid, seating is very limited. There is a take out section, then a patio section for dining. We went on a Saturday night, put our name on the clipboard and got ready for a wait. There were five of us, and it was very busy, so we weren't surprised when we waited for an hour and a half for the table. The staff there is wonderful, the hostess was great and apologized for the wait. Our server was attentive and prompt with service. We ordered oysters for the table and they were fresh and delicious. Soup and a Caesar salad were ordered for starters and both were very good. For the main course my fiancé's dad ordered the crab legs (sixty dollars for three) he said they were good, but was disappointed in how many he got. I had the crab cakes and they were pretty standard. My fiancé's sister got a pasta dish that she said was wonderful. So it was a bit of a mixed experience. I will definitely go back next time we are in the area, maybe not on a Saturday night.",3 star rating,Casey S.
4/26/2021,"Sacramento, CA","I loved being able to eat seafood right on the edge of the water! The seafood here is insanely fresh and the lines prove it. I came here on a Monday at 1pm and the wait was 1.5 hours long. Luckily though, they have a window on the left side of the restaurant that you can order the same exact dishes from then eat on the tables overlooking the water, but you will not have a server and sit inside the actual restaurant. I didn't mind that option so it was a nice casual meal. I got a bunch of options but my favorite was definitely the oysters. So nice and fresh! The crab was pretty sweet but hard to crack into, so be prepared to put some work into it. Also, I was really excited for the uni too as I heard SB is known for their fresh uni, but it wasn't as sweet or creamy as I was expecting. Still nice and fresh though",4 star rating,Jacqueline N.
1/16/2021,"Los Angeles, CA",We had a Day trip in Santa Barbara and this seafood place is way above our expectations. We are very happy with everything we ordered.We had the Lobster Roll & Lobster Pasta .

The Lobster Pasta is indeed the highlight of the Day!We will definitely come back soon again!,5 star rating,Julie L.
1/10/2021,"Berkeley, CA","It wouldn't be a trip to any pier without getting some clam chowder! This place's chowder is more on the thick side (more roux-y), yet the soup is light enough that you don't feel bloated or heavy after eating a whole bowl like you normally do! There were a lot of clams in our serving as you can see in the photo (though I didn't notice them at first since most sunk to the bottom). There was also a good amount of celery for added texture, and an order came with a bag of oyster crackers.We also got the oyster shooters- oysters with cocktail sauce and a bit of grated parmesan cheese on top, served in a sauce container! This one wasn't as much of a hit as the chowder; I feel like there was too much cocktail sauce to taste the oyster, but on the bright side I'd rather have too much sauce than not enough!",4 star rating,Michelle H.

Ended up being delicious and filling!",3 star rating,Megan N.
3/1/2021,"Redlands, CA","Very good clam chowder, it's what you would expect from a restaurant on a pier. The chowder was creamy with a lot of clams.

11/9/2020,"Union City, CA","Santa Barbara is known for their uni so of course I had to get some fresh sea urchin while I was visiting Santa Barbara! At 22 dollars a pop, it wasn't cheap, but man oh man was it satisfying. The uni and scallop combination had a clean yet rich taste, while the texture was smooth. Probably the best uni I've had to date. The sea urchin was so fresh the spines were still moving! It came with limes and ponzu sauce which were not needed since I didn't want anything to take away from the uni and scallop flavor.I also ordered the clam chowder which had big chunks of clam but other than that was unremarkable. I probably won't be back because of the price, but it was a great experience!",4 star rating,Danny L.
11/9/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Little to no wait cause it was raining the day I went.  Only outdoor seating available during these COVID times.  Make sure to bundle up! It gets cold and windy out here.  My mask literally kept me warm until I had to take it off to eat.Bowl of chowder - Definitely hit the spot! Plenty of clams. Kept our bellies warm in this cold weather.Uni - Served over scallops and lime.  Interesting combo, but it worked! Uni was so fresh and buttery! Gotta love that SB uni.Local Box Crab - Recommended by the waitress and it didn't disappoint! Comes with a few onion rings.  Never had box crab before, but glad I did. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, try this! Great staff. Loved the ocean view.Tip: If you don't want to wait in the long line, the takeout line is on the other side.

5/23/2021,"Santa Maria, CA",We sat and waited for about 30 min. When we finally sat down the table was really dirty. We had to clean it ourselves. It was still sticky.

11/15/2020,"Los Altos, CA","Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a restaurant located at the end of Stearn's wharf. My friend and I didn't know that you could drive into the wharf and park there, so we parked on Cabrillo. If you don't mind the walk, parking on Cabrillo is free after 6PM! If you do choose to park in the wharf, it will cost you $1.50/hr if I remember correctly.The restaurant itself seemed a little run down to me. The decor was old and it wasn't the cleanest place I've been if I'm being honest. We arrived a little after 6PM on a Friday and it took us about 10 minutes to get seated. The day I went it was incredibly windy that it sort of damaged my experience. We sat outdoors and there was NO space heaters. It was so windy that an umbrella fell over and hit the table behind us, shattering a customer's glass. Needless to say, my food was cold as soon as it was served.The restaurant does have very reasonable prices for seafood. I ordered the lobster pasta for around $20, and it had so much potential. It was a small portion that probably wouldn't' fill you up unless you had an appetizer as well. It was honestly pretty good, but because it was so windy, my food was so cold. There wouldn't have been a point asking the waitress to reheat the food as well because it would have just been cooled down by the wind within a minute or two. From what I could enjoy, the lobster was good but there could have been a larger portion.Also, our waitress was not the friendliest to us compared to the other tables around us for some reason. Although I did not have a great experience here, maybe you will if you come during a sunny day!!",2 star rating,Serina L.
5/13/2021,"Diamond Bar, CA","The food was good. But there was a guy sitting literately next to us coughing really hard and very often. He made us very uncomfortable.

We chose 1/2 dozen oysters (excellent), a bowl of the clam chowder (excellent), and a lobster roll.

10/24/2020,"Los Angeles, CA",Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a staple seafood restaurant in Santa Barbara and it's one of those spots that you must go if you're in the area according to many people but NOT me. If I had to describe one word for my experience was COLD2020 Covid edition: Outdoor patio dining is available. QR code Menus available online. Sanitized pens to write on the wait list Food:1) coconut shrimp (4 stars****) - probably one of the best coconut shrimp that I've had. I don't even like coconut pieces. 2) lobster bisque (3 stars***) - it was good but not exceptional. It would've been tastier if it were hotter. 3) calamari sandwich (3 Stars***) - it was okay plain but tasted much better with tartar sauce. I was expecting pieces of fried calamari but ended up with a calamari patty. 4) Lobster Roll (1 star*) - horrible. Lobster tasted like it's been sitting out for awhile. Similar to how an old tuna salad is. Sides: 1 star*1) onion rings - Cold. Like it's been sitting out for awhile and not even under the heat lamps2) Coleslaw - it tasted soggy and spoiled. No crisp from the veggies. It seemed like a large batch was made early in the morning but wasn't refrigerated properly. Service: The server was nice. We sent the lobster roll back because it was so bad and the server took it off our bill. we ended up ordering coconut shrimp again because we enjoyed it so much. However getting the second one made us realize that the first one was sitting out for awhile because it was cold. The second one was very fresh and hot.,2 star rating,James B.
10/14/2020,"La Palma, CA","This is the must visit if you are visiting Santa Barbara for the first time. One of the best place to get fresh seafoods with reasonable prices.

Long line for dining outdoor. Must faster if you just do takeout.",5 star rating,Ken H.
2/18/2021,"Sugar Land, TX",Delicious food and great views. I got the crab melt sandwich and my husband got the local crab. The crab had so much meat and it was so filling.

10/22/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Rating this place a 5* just for the fresh sea urchins. Soooooo fresh (they serve it with the shell and the spikes were literally still moving at the end of my meal), clean, creamy, sweet yet savoury. The best sea urchins you can get!Came on a Thursday for lunch and opted for take out (was virtually no wait, and lots of socially distant seating on the pier - more socially distant than their dining area at the time). Staff wore masks (over the nose) and provided individually wrapped sanitizing wipes. Ordered the sea urchin with raw scallops and lime, California king crab (bc they said it was the easiest type of crab to eat), clam chowder, and lobster bisque. Sea urchin with raw scallops and lime - fave item. Wasn't a huge fan of the scallops, have had fresher, sweeter elsewhere. But the sea urchin - ugh so good. I don't know what they do but I've ordered sea urchins from Stephanie Seafood (who I thought supplied this place) and it was a huge pain to clean and prepare and really did not taste good. The sea urchins here are the real deal. Try it even if you hate sea urchin (I used to hate sea urchins until I tried the type from Santa Barbara. Now I literally came to Santa Barbara to eat sea urchins) California king crab - super fresh, very very prickly, but meat came out pretty easily! Love the cocktail sauce that came with it too, tasted much more nuanced than your regular cocktail sauce at a restaurant, idk. Did I say very prickly.Clam chowder - tasted good but I don't think it's a must have. Very rich. Lobster bisque - also tasted good but not a must have. Would come again for the sea urchin.",5 star rating,Jessica H.
9/24/2020,"Winston-Salem, NC","I was in town for work during the pandemic. I think California had JUST allowed restaurants to open back up, which was good for me because I was literally across the country from my fridge. I did a lot of searching on where to eat with outside seating and this place just stood out to me. It was a little breezy and chilly so I ordered soup and 5 oysters. ""What kind of oysters do you like?""""Ones I can't get on the East Coast.""Boy, did they deliver! I was in heaven. Sitting there with an amazing view, great food and a beer. What more could you ask for eating alone? The service was quick and while the menu was limited, there were still plenty of options. If I ever return to Santa Barbara, this will be my first stop. I need to explore more of their menu. It might be a bucket list item for me.",5 star rating,Meredith S.

We opted to wait in line for the take-out instead which was also very long (wait time ~ 1 hour). There are outdoor tables on the pier which is where we ate but it was super windy/chilly as the sun went down.We ordered:fresh uni with scallop- SOO smooth and yummy. We didn't need the limes each piece was sitting on.grilled prawns- the person we ordered from recommended these since they only have them once a year right there in SB.  These were okay, I think I would have preferred another plate of uni instead!rock crab- we wanted the box crab but they were sold out! this crab was still delicious but we definitely need to be back to try the box crab!cioppino- this was a great hearty addition to our meal in between the fresh seafood!overall, we definitely would come back next time we are in SB!

Rock crab was good but seemed a little expensive and hard to eat without any tables or seating. The uni dish did not pack well in the to go container and for some reason the uni was bitter. We also got the lobster roll which had a lobster but no seasoning/flavor or taste. Just lobster on a roll... literally. Overall food was ok, would probably come back when we can sit there and eat in non-covid times but their food does not pack well...",4 star rating,Jennifer H.
9/15/2020,"Santa Monica, CA","Fresh seafood with a cool view out on the edge of the pier.  They have a take out window with a few picnic tables nearby and their outdoor patio open for full service.I got the box crab based on recommendations, and it didn't disappoint.  It was fresh and sweet, overall a delight to eat.  It came with lemon, melted butter, and cocktail sauce--all of the makings of a great meal.  It was a bit much for me to alone, but it depends on your appetite.  I also order the uni shooter, to try it without having to order the larger platter.  It came in a small dish with some type of savory sauce (it seemed soy sauce based), a raw egg, and chives, which I wasn't really expecting.  Surprisingly, the egg was refreshing and it all mixed together well, but I would've liked the option to order individual portions of the uni on its own.  Food was slightly on the pricey side, but pretty reasonable considering it's seafood and in Santa Barbara.The takeout window is on the side of the building, and you have the option of taking your food to go, or eating outside on the pier.  There was plenty of space between the tables and a station near the restaurant to bus your own trays (to my knowledge, the tables aren't cleaned in between parties as it's not regulated seating).Overall, this place definitely wins for its freshness and unique location.  Will come back next time I'm in the area!",4 star rating,Kelsey P.
5/5/2021,"Modesto, CA","Thought the reviews on the Cioppino sounded good so I walked in for an early dinner.  Service was fast and friendly. I started with the NE Clam Chowder that was ok.  The Cioppino was served in a bread bowl and was very hot with a nice crab claw on top.  The crab was tough like it was over cooked or a reheated leftover, just terrible.  The best part was the few scallops and prawns.  It had mussels and clams in shell but It lacked fish and became too soggy with the bread.  The taste was good enough to eat half of it but I do not recommend it.",3 star rating,Jeff F.
11/5/2020,"Arcadia, CA","My girlfriend and I have been super skeptical about doing outdoor dining. This is the first place we decided to go in the last 7 months. I've got to say, not only is it the most normal we have both felt but we felt entirely safe the entire time.All the guests have masks on that are waiting in line and the staff have on masks the entire time. Guests also seem courteous enough to have masks on while they are ordering and only take off their masks when they eat and continue to put their masks on before they leave the table.Came here because of the stellar reviews and we did not regret it. Fresh seafood right on the pier overlooking the beautiful harbor, what more could you ask for?- box crab (apparently very difficult to catch, something like 600 to 700 m under the sea. Officially the BEST crab I've ever had in my life, incredibly sweet and tender) 5/5- lobster (cooked to perfection. Meat was totally juicy. Impressively, the biggest lobster I've ever had) 5/5- onion rings (both dishes came with onion rings but they were so good we got a whole extra side) 5/5If you are in town, definitely give this place a try, definitely worth those extra bucks!",5 star rating,Tiff L.

9/10/2020,"San Gabriel, CA","Stopped by the wharf and got some fresh seafood here. We were seated quickly (it was just a party if 2) and it was nice to sit outdoors. The menu had lots of wonderful seafood option for a reasonable price, especially in a tourist area. Our favorite was the special of the day- fresh uni over raw scallop. It was paired well with a dipping sauce and tasted sweet and buttery. The steamed mussels/clams (we ordered half and half- just ask the waiter!) was delicious. We dipped the fresh bread in the ""soup"" and it was freshly made with herbs and garlic. It felt like a nice light meal. The heaviest dish was the clam linguini. It didn't taste too special. I think the creaminess took over the fresh seafood flavor. Covidness: waiters wore mask, bathroom line is outside the building and only one person uses it at a time, seated outdoors.",4 star rating,Kim C.
1/9/2021,"Long Beach, CA","Great seafood for great prices! Came here for lunch and was recommended by a local person to get their lobster dish. We went for the lobster roll which was a good choice. Lobster was fresh, chewy and well seasoned. The lobster bisque was also phenomenal. There were good chunks of lobster in there and it was creamy and hearty. The crab cakes were also an excellent choice as well. There were a lot of crab and not a lot of fillers or other stuff in the crab cakes. Everything tasted very fresh. Although there was no dine in our outside tables, we found some benches around the restaurant to enjoy our food safely. Yay!",5 star rating,Nam T.
8/10/2020,"West Hollywood, CA","Santa Barbara Shellfish Company was so delicious that we came back twice during our weekend trip to SB! Although pricy- it's well worth the freshness of the seafood. The restaurant offers patio seating or take-out with the menu posted online and QR codes taped up in the surrounding area. The take-out window has floor marking 6 ft. apart to help customers social distance. The patio seating was packed when we arrived in the afternoon and there was a fair number of people waiting that tried to socially distance from other groups. All of the staff wore masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer was on every table. Now for the food:Fresh Uni (sea urchin) and Scallops over lime slices- (5/5) I highly recommend this appetizer!! If you love rich buttery uni and raw scallops, this could not be more delicious. We came back the next day to get two of these dishes as a snack. New England Clam Chowder- (5/5) Creamy and hearty chowder with chunks of clams and potatoes. This helped warm us up while we sat on the windy patio. Scallop Ceviche- (4/5) Generous amount of fresh scallop ceviche served with chips. The ceviche needed a bit more lime and maybe even a dash of hot sauce. Crab Cakes- (4/5) Crab cakes made with tasty lumps of crab meat and fried to perfection. The two onion rings that came with the dish were also perfect. Even though we had a fairly long wait, the food here was so worth it. I also do appreciate all of the precautions the staff takes to make the dining and the take-out experience safe for their customers.",5 star rating,Melanie H.
8/6/2020,"Fresno, CA","This is probably goes against most of the reviews but I am always honest in my reviews. There was absolutely NOTHING special about this clam chowder in a bread bowl. People flood to wharfs for clam chowder bread bowls, heck in Monterey there are people out in front of each restaurant with trial cups of their chowder to try and win you over. Had I tasted this beforehand, we would have skipped it.  The chowder was just average. Not amazing! My next beef with it was the bread bowl itself was very tiny! So tiny in fact, that I had to pour my chowder in 1/3 at a time, eat it up, pour some more and repeat. The bread bowl was 5-6 inches in diameter and maybe 3 inches tall. I am used to bread bowls on piers/wharfs of at least 6-7 inches in diameter and 4-5 inches tall. I also got a shrimp cocktail and although I didn't use the sauce, it was 6 pieces. Then we ordered 2 bottles of water and they were real glass bottles which was a nice touch since the glass could not be tipped over by the wind easily. You are either going to hope you get a picnic table to sit down at right by the restaurant or you are going to take yours to go. It was very windy on the wharf and we were there at about 2pm. The biggest reason why I gave this only 3 stars is because I was underwhelmed and paid a total of $46 for 2 bread bowls of chowder, 1 shrimp cocktail and 2 bottles of water. I feel the prices were too steep for the quality of food.",3 star rating,Sara B.

8/8/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","After doing some research for some good SB seafood, we decided to make a dinner trip to this restaurant, SB Shellfish Company.Located at the very end of Stearns Wharf, it was quite crowded for a Sunday night.  We were already expecting it, so we weren't surprised at all.The waitlist system is a bit tacky, but there are sitting areas all over.  Here's a tip: once you place your name on the waiting list, make sure you listen to your name and sit as close as possible to the front entrance, because they don't have a mobile calling/paging system.  Once they skip your name, you won't get a table for a while.We waited for roughly 45 minutes until we were finally called.  It gave us a chance to browse through their menu online, using the QR code.  Our waiter, Belen, was awesome.  We told him what we wanted, which was the 2 lb crab.  We also ordered an appetizer--the SB shrimp cocktail.  Our drink of choice: glass of Gainey Sauv Blanc, House Red, and a Pinot Grigio.Let's start with the: SB Shrimp Cocktail--absolutely delicious and the accompanying butter & cocktail sauce was really good.  A wonderful appetizing start!Next: 2 lb crab--oh my gosh--just delicious.  I don't think I've ever had a better crab meal that tastes super fresh and savory.  They also come with scissors and extra plates, and holy crap, this filled us up so fast!The wine:  due to COVID-19, they did not serve in wine glasses, which is totally understandable.  They served it in plastic cups, which was smart.  The wine made me a bit tipsy :)Service: awesome & amazing.  For a restaurant that is SUPER busy, they did such a great job of taking our orders, and delivering the food in a timely manner.  Absolute no mess-ups at all.Highly recommendable, but be ready for a long 45-75 minute wait, but I'm telling you it is absolutely worth every penny!Overall grade: A+my",5 star rating,Bobby K.

Ordered: Half calamari/half shrimp Crab Cakes lobster roll Kids chicken nuggets & fries Clam chowder soup I have to say the food was tasty, thought the lobster roll was decent. Not as flavorful as I expected but still good and worth the $15 (I think it was that price). Crab Cakes, were good but not the best I've had. Their onion rings are delicious. Clam Chowder soup was delicious! Definitely recommend. Kids chicken nuggets and fries, were FIRE. Their fries are amazing, I was shocked and the chicken nuggets were so cute and shaped like McDonald's nuggets but was 20x better!

7/12/2020,"Goleta, CA","Looking at the reviews of Santa Barbara Shellfish Company, I was very excited to spend my Sunday morning on the pier to eat their so claimed delicious food. I had high expectations for this place especially for their lobster rolls! However, I was reminded how looks can be deceivingLooking at the dine-in side of the restaurant, it seems that a lot of the customers were not following the social distancing rule and there was no worker to control the area. So my friend and I decided to order to-go seeing how the restaurants wasn't going through with the safety measures. My friend and I had ordered two lobster rolls that came with coleslaw and two onion rings. We also ordered the fried calamari, oysters, shrimps, and scallops from the ""small bites"" section of the menu. Since this was our first time here, we wanted to make it worth while by ordering the most recommended items. Lobster Rolls: The bread of the lobster roll wasn't toasted or crunchy as it looked. it was quite soft and cold as if it was on the table. It didn't feel fresh at all. As for the filling in the lobster roll, it honestly tasted like a tuna sandwich that wasn't pleasing to my tastebuds. I know this sounds extreme, but my friend and I seriously felt like throwing up with each bite we had. We didn't want to waste it and believed that maybe it will grow on us and we would like it. But, no. The Fried Calamari, Oysters, Shrimps, and Scallops: This dish also included coleslaw and onion rings. The amount of seafood on the plate was reasonable. But once again, the taste was just as bad as the lobster roll which each bite being questionable on how it was cooked. Overall opinion on the food: I am very disappointed as all my expectations of how ""amazing"" this place is has gone down the drain. I have never been to a place where I need to list all the seasonings that should go on it like do I have to throw my food in the ocean to get some salt?? It was plain tasting and displeasing to the tongue. The only enjoyable item on the plate was the onion rings... you go to a place that is suppose to be amazing with their seafood.. but you're favorite is the onion rings... how upsetting. I definitely wasted $60 coming here and would NOT recommend anyone else unless they step up their cooking skills and add some seasoning. Till then, don't be deceived and spend your money elsewhere",1 star rating,Ai H.
1/8/2021,"Rosemead, CA","Located at the very end of Stearns Warf, Santa Barbara Shellfish Company occupies a small building overlooking the beach. Arrived around 1 PM on a Friday and there were patrons surrounding the restaurant. Line was short and food came out quick. There's free 90 minute parking on the wharf and an additional $2.50 per hour afterwards. Alternative parking would be the lot next to the skate ring for $2 an hour. Got the clam chowder in a bowl along with two oyster shooters. The clam chowder might be the best I have had. The chowder was on the thicker side, plenty of clams, and a bit lighter than what I have had in the past. As for the oyster shooters, the oysters were small and the amount of cocktail mixture overpowered the taste of the oysters. Was nice to try but I would probably pass on this the next time around. Tl;dr: try parking on the wharf first before looking for alternatives. Lots of clams in the clam chowder.",4 star rating,Dominic G.
9/9/2020,"San Francisco, CA","Was on a mission to hit up all the highly rated spots in Santa Barbara. It being my 1st time, everyone says I must try the Uni in SB and boy am I glad I did. Parking: I parked a few blocks away from the harbor and it was pretty much free parking. I didn't have to worry about moving my car. The harbor has 90min free parking and then $2.50/hr. I would do this if I didn't feel like walking, however, the long wait and the amount of food I ordered, worked out fine for me. Location: at the very end of the harbor, plenty of outside seating. Also they have a to-go area where you can just order food to go and sit on the beaches. Beware of seagulls!! Food: I ordered the Uni w/ scallops and the box crab special for one! Holy smokes, everything was so good that I demolished every little piece of crab meat and Uni and was still hungry. Strongly recommend the box crab! I would've ordered the Uni and oyster shooter but I had another place I wanted to try afterwards. Views: I got seated along the ocean/harbor which was a very nice view.

The linguine and tacos came out first and they were both so delicious! There's a ton of clams and lobster meat that made it worth it. The sauce in the linguine was perfect to use to dip the bread too! The rock crab was my favorite. At $18/Lb, it was well worth it since there was so much sweet crab meat in it! I didn't even have to dip it in the butter or squeeze limes on it. The onion ring was really crispy too!! Overall, I would definitely come here again!!

This is a must order.Our main lobster and rock crab came with onion rings and cole slaw. Seafood was incredibly fresh and delectable. Truly great.The Sea Urchin was among the freshest I've ever had. They placed it on top of a scallop with some lime and a special sauce. So sweet and clean. Would order again.Note: this is a casual, get down and dirty with your seafood type of fare.

Everyone was socially distanced (1 party per table) and kept their masks on, except while eating. Single unisex restroom inside the restaurant, was a bit unkempt.As for the food:-Clam Chowder: this was standard, can't go wrong with this soup.-Shrimp Tacos: served with a bed of rice. This was just okay, but filling.-Scallop Ceviche: served with tortilla chips, and baby scallops. This was just okay as well, I would've preferred more spice.-Lobster Roll: served with onion rings and coleslaw. I've had better. There were a few small pieces of shell in the lobster meat.

8/19/2020,"Pittsburgh, PA","We came here on around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. Never having been here before, we had high hopes based on the review. Walking up, there was some slight confusion - there is a pole for you to jot down your name/hold a place in line and another line for you to do takeout. We put our name down and got in line for To-go orders at the same time, we would be happy with whichever came first. During our wait, we were able to grab a beer, which was nice. Our party of 2 ended up getting called in about 20 minutes from the time we put in our name. We got seated outside, along the railing, with great views of the ocean, boats, and kayakers. Food - much less exciting than the views. We had the baked clams, local uni, and 3lb rock crab special. It was all...fine. The baked clams looked great, but the temperature of them was just warm. I'm usually not a stickler for food temps, but I was expecting the clams to be hotter and it made them texturally unappealing. The local uni - nothing special. I get it, it's supposed to be light and buttery and subtle, but I was still wanting more. The crab was good, cool presentation and flavorful. The best part was the service - polite and quick. We ordered two rounds of bloody Mary's that were brought promptly, possibly my favorite part of the meal. I did enjoy the pickled green beans they come with, nice touch!

It was chilly even in July, bring a jacket.   The clam chowder was delicious with some chunks of celery and a slight herbal taste in the broth.   The baked clams are a must-try!  They were a good size, not too much breading, baked to perfection.   The lobster pasta had plenty of lobster and sauce, served with sourdough on the side and enough to share.    I had another glass of the Babcock Pinot Noir and fell in love with it, which is why we decided to take a drive up to the Babcock Winery!",5 star rating,Mel M.

5/26/2020,"Arcadia, CA","After been cooped  up at home for two months, we finally had a chance to go out during memorial weekend by visiting Santa Barbara. One particular thing I wanted to do is to eat seafood at the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company. We drove directly to the restaurant from LA on Monday. We called ahead to make sure the restaurant was open for take out. The restaurant has been opened but only for take out. But the outdoor benches and tables are available for patrons. We ordered the local rock crab special, two bowls of New England clam chowder and a lobster roll. The order was ready very quickly and we just ate at one of outdoor tables while enjoying the beach and the beautiful view of Santa Barbara's Mountaint from the pier. The rock crabs are local to Santa Barbara and they are very meaty and tasty. The meats are tender and sweet. The clam chowder is one of the specialties for this restaurant. We ate the lobster roll last. As we had lobster roll in Boston, so it may not be fair to compare. But I have to say, the lobster roll is not too bad for a California restaurant. The taste was a bit bland but ok. Well, it's worth it to drive all the way from LA to Santa Barbara for seafood. We've just been locked down at home for too long.

Crab sandwich (2/5) - one side of the sandwich was toasted one side was soft. Crab filling was pretty much tasteless :/ My husband loves crab so he was fine with it. Lobster pasta (2.5/5) - There was a generous serving of lobster but the pasta tasted bitter, lacked salt and other flavorings. Pasta wasn't boiled in salt water. Ingredients were good tho, just that the pasta was meh.  Calamari/oyster& onion rings (3/5) - Best dish of the night, the batter was crunchy. Oyster was good sized and juicy but bitter.

But a lady behind us noticed the conversation and came over to our table just to show us the size of her bowl. Her BOWL was three times the size of our CUP that we paid EXTRA for BOWLS. I will never be coming back and I DO NOT recommend this place. Please stop lying to your customers and overcharging them. If you made a mistake, please rectify the situation instead of doubling down and belittling us.

Some dishes maybe prepared in batches for easier service but made daily. It didn't take that long till out order was ready. The meal was really good and fresh. Service was good, the guy taking our order.Only downfall, there was one menu at the window where you would order. So if you didn't have a phone, you wouldn't know what was there. Plus, one window to order and pick up. Some people just don't grasp the concept as safe distancing and would walk right up to the window while someone else was there. Beside that, food is always amazing. Been here a plenty of time and have never been disappointed.",5 star rating,Alex K.

The lobster rolls were delicious and there was a lot of lobster meat. We ordered two and mine had toothpicks holding the two toasted breads together we and the other order didn't so it fell apart. It was pretty sloppy if you ask me. My toast, as pictured, was also burnt on one side but I just cut it off and it was still good. Loved the crispy onion rings and the side slaw! Good flavors overall and it was quick. Was it worth it for the high cost? Maybe.",5 star rating,Darlene D.

Crab louie salad was a good way to eat crab without peeling them, their clam chowder was so GOOD!!The baked giant clam was okay (wanted to try the oyster rocker fellar next time and crab cake).

10/13/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","So excited we got a chance to visit this place on our visit to SB. This restaurant is located directly at the wharf, over the water. They're known for quality seafood, and they served just that! We put our names down on a Sunday morning and waited about 30 minutes to be sat. They do have a take-out option where you can order all that's on the menu and find a table right on the pier. We chose the full-service option. Prices seem to be the same though. We also didn't mind to wait since there was a lot to enjoy while waiting anyway. We ordered the clam chowder, some oysters, and the rock crab to share. We absolutely enjoyed every single order, but I've got to say the rock crab was absolutely delish! This is a good place to sit down and enjoy if you're looking to eat some seafood and enjoy that ocean breeze!",5 star rating,Margaret P.

5/30/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Very disappointed with the food and wait times here. We were quite hungry after a full morning/early afternoon of walking State Street, and decided to see what the hype was about here.The hype is all about the views, apparently. Which, if I'd have known, could have easily walked some drive-thru out there and had a more satisfying, and far less expensive, meal.The reviews include those of quite a few locals so I thought why not? From the looks of it, and the taste of it, this place screams ""tourist trap""!The food wasn't even worth photographing... why take up precious memory on my phone.We shared a lobster roll and the calamari, which included onion rings and cole slaw on the side. I have to say, the two stars are for our sides. They were really good.The cole slaw is a little sweet with raisins and pineapple chunks, which I've never had. I thought that was a very nice touch. The onion rings are big and nicely battered.Unfortunately, the lobster roll and calamari were disappointing! The roll itself was stale and cold. When I asked the cashier to replace it with a freshly toasted one, he looked at me like I was some type of Karen! Wtf!? Cook it right and this won't happen.The calamari must have been flown in fresh overnight from Capri or Sicily because, although it was tasty, there was a very small portion on our plate.Overall, for the $50 plus tip we paid and 30 minutes we waited (in line and for the food to be prepared), it is not worth it.",2 star rating,Arturo M.

3/18/2020,"Boston, MA","It's a bit touristy, but unlike a lot of tourist places, the food isn't overrated. The uni is likely the best I've ever had, and likely the freshest. My past experiences with sea urchin were varied. Most of them start briny, but then end with a weird, sort of bitter aftertaste. However, this uni was briny throughout and had a wonderful creamy texture. Having it with the scallops gave it some body and texture.I went for the local abalone. It's a firmer and meatier shellfish than ones most Americans are used to. The abalone was cooked nicely and tasted fresh. The rice, while a nice accompaniment (in principle), was rather salty, though.The box crab is more expensive, and I didn't compare it with the rock crab, in terms of taste. However, while it's a bit of work, the meat was sweet...almost lobster sweet. The meat was flavorful and fresh. Service was thoughtful, as the server gave me detailed descriptions of the offerings. Even off-season and at 2:00 pm, you still have to wait a bit. Like most touristy spots, you're going to pay a bit for food, but it's worth a look.",4 star rating,Phil C.
3/16/2020,"Westlake Village, CA","Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a pretty fun spot located towards the end of the Stearns Wharf pier in Santa Barbara. With over 1,900 reviews, it is a bit of a destination with a good reputation. Established in 1980, this restaurant is known for their fresh local seafood, particularly crab and other shellfish.Came here for my first time about a month ago (2/17/20) after a weekend in wine country. We were craving some Santa Barbara Uni, and this place had been on my radar for a while. There was a bit of a wait to sit inside, so we decided to order at their side window and eat outside. I ordered the Uni + Scallop special, but the menu contained a lot of tempting options to choose from.To be completely honest, the Uni was pretty disappointing. Granted, I'm used to eating premium quality at high-end sushi restaurants, but the Uni here was nothing to rave about or go out of your way for. That being said, it's definitely a fun dish and very fresh, as it comes with the shell that is still live/moving. I'd recommend ordering one of the crabs here, but if you're feeling adventurous and want to try some local Uni, give it a try! Just lower your expectations a little.",4 star rating,Michael A.
11/15/2020,"Palo Alto, CA",We went on a beautiful blue day in October and it was glorious sitting outside and enjoying such sweet fresh seafood.

10/13/2020,"Saint Paul, MN","Came up to Santa Barbara for the weekend so of course had to go and check out all of the sights. While walking along the wharf, we came across this restaurant which is maybe a little touristy but still came recommended. The line was LONG but I was in the mood for seafood. They have the option for you to be seated on their patio or you can get food to go and just eat it somewhere else on the wharf- we added ourselves to both lists but we still waited for over an hour to even get to the window. I appreciated how efficient they were with the number of people ordering food though and everyone taking our order and prepping the food was very pleasant. Given that we got our order to go since it was so late, the food was a little cool but obviously no good way to prevent that. I started off with the oysters which were definitely fresh but could have used a little seasoning or something with a little kick. I also had the crab which was tasty for sure but more difficult to get all of the good stuff out when you don't have the utensils- I think next time I would stay just so I can use the crab cracker. Otherwise, my boyfriend had the bread bowl with clam chowder which was bomb so I was a little jealous of that. Overall, pretty OK meal but I would say not worth it to wait in that long of a line again.",3 star rating,Lauren N.
10/3/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","Super fresh seafood, on the pier - yes please! Now, is there a long wait and higher prices than you'd like? Definitely. It's also not exactly a sit down spot right now, though there are a handful of tables. You order from the overworked but nice guys in the windows and you enjoy. When I go, i go for the lobster roll. The crab is as fresh as you ever want it, and sweet like it should be. My daughter likes the fried plate, which is great except the mussels, which should immediately be thrown over the side of Stearns Wharf. For lunch or early dinner, this is a killer spot.",5 star rating,Dare H.
3/20/2021,"Cypress, TX",Sat outside right over the water. Chilly but they have heaters. We got the last of the unit for the day.

Our tastebuds felt like Gods and Goddesses, because every bite of food packed a punch of out-of-this-world, immortal flavor. In fact, our buds are forever scarred with how damn good seafood should and can be now. Clam Chowder - don't go anywhere else! I'm a local Californian who grew up on this soup combo. I've had it in the Bay, Central Coast, and SoCal. This is the G.O.A.T. Lobster Bisque - it's delicious but if I'm being honest, if you have to choose, go chowder all day everyday. Cioppino - HOLY BILLY IDOL this is a MUST GET. We had never heard of it but our awesome waitress said it was her favorite thing on the menu so we did one of those ""leaps of faith"". Let's just say, the spirit caught us and we have been forever blessed. Lobster Roll - again it's delicious but, if I'm being honest, it did not even touch the chowder or cioppino. Onion Rings - crispy, tasty, and great side.",5 star rating,Hannah L.

Besides the to die for chowder the fired calamari and onion rings were also pretty good! I highly recommend the onion rings. They are huge and the onions have this nice sweet taste to them. I did not try an oyster shooter however my boyfriend claims that they are amazing. So I'll take his word for it.

9/9/2020,"Anaheim, CA","What is the hype and the long line for this place?? Is it solely because it's on the pier?? On our recent trip to Santa Barbara, we decided that it would not be a complete trip without having some seafood. We opted for SB Shellfish Company after our extensive Yelp research, and eliminating a few options that we've had in our past visits. Walking to the end of the pier, we found a long, well socially-distanced line to the side of the restaurant. They also offered dine-in option in their small patio. The take-out line moved VERY slowly. It looks like they had a small kitchen prepping all the food, and only had one cashier/number calling doing both: taking the order and yelling out number for food pick up. We just wanted to try a few things, and decided that we wanted their lobster bisque and clams pasta. Unfortunately they were out of clams the day we visited, and had to substitute for scallops and shrimp. The lobster bisque was good, very creamy and there were lobster bits in the soup. It was overall quite tasty and reasonably charged as well. However, we did find the pasta very disappointing. The sauce seemed like some sort of white wine reduction, with sundried tomatoes and garlic. The portion and flavor were both disappointing, and not worth the almost $20 that we spent on this dish. Not to mention we also had to wait ~30 minutes for our food to come out. I'd have to say, I'm sure there are plenty other better restaurants in SB that would measure up and out-taste this restaurant. I suppose there is something about dining on the pier that makes this place a prime location for a date night or a convenient family meal.",3 star rating,Katherine L.
9/8/2020,"Irvine, CA","I'm so glad we decided to walk to the end of the pier and found this restaurant.  We were in SB over the holiday weekend and my husband was craving uni.  We went to a different restaurant two days in a row and they were sold out both days.  So it was pure luck that we found uni here!  The texture of the uni feels like butter on the tongue.  It's is so incredibly fresh and delicious.  The lobster roll was probably the best I've ever tasted.  The lobster was in a soft bread roll.  It was flavorful, fresh,  and the portion was generous.  And last but not least, the oyster shooters were also a hit.",5 star rating,Amina K.
10/10/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Ideally I would give this place 3.5 stars but since they don't have half stars I would say it was closer to a 3 star experience. We went on Friday afternoon and decided to eat on the long picnic benches. There were a few people waiting to be seated on the clipboard but we decided to order from the to go window. We ordered a beer, Shirley temple, 2.5lb box crab, fried calamari, and 1/2 dozen oysters and the price was $105. Box crab was tasty for the first 4 legs but then by the time I had been working on the rest, the meat had gone cold. There wasn't a whole lot of meat but def a lot of work put into it. Husband enjoyed his oysters. The fried calamari was pretty good but was given a very small portion given the price. I'd say the box crab was good as a one time experience but in the future, I will stick to their other entrees.",3 star rating,Kara K.
9/2/2020,"Downey, CA","My husband and I came to the Santa Barbara shellfish Company on a recent trip to Santa Barbara.This restaurant is located at the end of Stearns wharf pier. It is the largest pier I've ever been on. You can even drive your car up all the way to the end and I believe the first hour of parking is free.We, however, decided to walk on.The wait in line was quite long, at least 45 minutes.It was also kind of confusing to figure out which line was for takeouts and which line was for outdoor seating.By the time we got seated it was already quite cold. And if you would've been quite nice if not for the darkness.Needless to say that shivering through my meal made the experience less pleasant, but it was partially my own fault. I recommend that you bring a jacket when you visit this restaurant because even in summer days Santa Barbara can get quite chilly at night.It was also really dark which kind of made for a funny incident; I ended up asking the waiter why he had brought me two glasses of water and where my wine glass was for the Prosecco, when in fact only one glass had water and in the other water glass he had poured part of my Prosecco.So a little more lighting and a heat lamp would have made this a lot better.My coconut shrimp was amazing! But the onion rings were missing from my order. I did not complain, because the waiters look quite busy. My husband's meal however, shrimp scampi left quite a bit to be desired. The shrimp looked more like shrimp mini than shrimp scampi, which was a little sad, for my husband really loves shrimp scampi. It definitely is an iconic place as far as SB restaurants go, so it's worth a visit, but the overall experience was a little underwhelming.",3 star rating,Jenneke K.
12/29/2019,"Discovery Bay, CA","We were pumped to try this infamous Santa Barbara uni, but they were out less than half and hour after opening!  - Oyster shooters:  Yay!  They weren't the huge suckers that I abhor.  Easy going down and I  enjoyed the cocktail sauce.  - Abalone: Very tender (one of the guys in front was hard at work pounding them as we walked in.  We had four little abalone, which looked even tinier atop the delicious tomato rice, but I get it...seafood is expensive.  The only complaint about this dish is it was seriously swimming in butter.  We left a good layer of tomato rice on the bottom of the bowl as a makeshift ""drain"" so we wouldn't be eating 75% butter 25% rice.- Local Spiny lobster 1.5 Pounds:  This day, it came in either 1.5lb or 2.5lb.  Meaty, tender, but honestly kinda flavorless.  I didn't think it was worth the $63 and change.  It was so well presented, though, that immediately after setting ours down, our neighbor pointed to it and said ""I want one of those!""Cute local joint.  Love the tanks with all the fresh sea creatures.  No reservations.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday, wrote our names down, and got seated at the bar in about ten minutes.  Note that the bar seating is also via list.  Several people tried to snag the bar seats and were told they needed to sign up.  They also have a small outdoor seating area and a to-go window with a long line as well.  By the time we left (12:30ish), the waitlist was crazy!",3 star rating,Sandee L.

We were not looking for anything to eat, but couldn't help but notice people enjoying fresh seafood on a bench on the pier. When we spotted a girl chowing down on a bread bowl of delicious cioppino, we canceled our dinner reservations at a fancy French restaurant and proceeded to stand in a 40 minute line at the Shellfish Company. Instead of dining in the restaurant, we opted to order at a window and dine on the bench to get some sun. Also, the restaurant had a huge waiting list on Sunday at 3pm. For $99, we got the following:1. Lobster: Oh so fresh and perfectly cooked!!2. Cioppino: This tomato based seafood soup was beautifully placed in a bread bowl.3. A cup of clam chowder: Flavorful and rich. 4. Diet Coke and a beer.Was it worth the wait... and price? Absolutely. We enjoyed a delicious meal on the pier on a cold, sunny day!

Maybe I'll eventually cook one up in LA instead?Thought about passing on it because of the price. But dining on renowned Santa Barbara urchin while in Santa Barbara, how could we not??!

It was my back up choice and I'm so glad we came here instead. We were able to get drinks from the bar while we waited for our table. The drinks were delicious and strong. We got seated quicker than the wait time we were told which was great! The service was excellent as well. We were seated on the patio and it was nice to have a view of the beach. We decided to go all out and ordered several things from the menu because we couldn't decide between the variety of options they offered.

I think for some people its a hit or a miss and our trip here was a miss. we came on a saturday during covid times and made sure to come early to avoid a wait. we biked directly here and hooked our bikes nearby the restaurant. we arrived around 11:20am and saw there was a to-go order window or a sit down waiting area. they were only serving on the deck outdoors. I waited for probably 10 minutes for someone to help us get a pen that worked to write our name down on the list (they at least had buckets for clean vs dirty pens). they used QR codes for menu.we were seated around 11:40am and it was pretty cold/windy since it was right on the water. we had a server seat us and I was pretty sad (since im more on the covid paranoid side) that when I opened my cloth napkin that held my utensils, there was a huge makeup/lipstick stain on the cloth napkin. really grossed me out. our food arrived pretty quickly around 10 minutes or less, but we were very unpleased. like other reviews ive read, food came out lukewarm and quickly became cold. lacked flavor in some part and just was disappointing.THE FOOD:-clam chowder bread bowl ($10.95) - super bummed! after eating at another restaurant the night before having my first clam chowder this was so disappointing. was lukewarm and just ok in flavor. the bread bowl was not worth. I found the bread to be too hard and just didn't taste great with the chowder. preferred to just eat it with crackers.-lobster roll ($21.95) - oh my goodness, for the price and just in general this lacked flavor. I didn't really want to eat it after. it arrived cold. the lobster filling had good amount of lobster which I appreciated, but flavor tremendously lacked. the toasted roll if maybe was buttered more and slightly warm it would have made it a bit enjoyable. coleslaw lacked flavor. onion rings were cold. overall I regretted ordering this dish so much.PROS:-right on the water-appreciated their covid efforts (dirty/clean pen buckets/QR code menus)CONS:-food lacked on my trip-very cold food and outdoor temp-dirty cloth napkins :(OVERALL:cool to visit, but id pass next time.",1 star rating,Jennifer Q.

Each leg was stuffed with so much meat! I received butter to dip with but didn't need it because the crab was already flavorful! My son had a lobster roll which he calls. ""LobsterSandwhich"" and he loved it! That roll did not stand a chance. We also go the fried seafood combo with the calamari which was also good.

This one seemed really well known and it was on the wharf so we gave it a try. We got the lobster roll, shrimp and lobster pasta, calamari, clam chowder, lobster tacos, and fresh oysters. The food was mediocre in my opinion. Nothing really stood out as amazing but nothing was bad either. I got a Bloody Mary but it did not taste right and was very tasteless.. Overall for the price we paid, I do not think it is worth it but it is a nice location and a place to try for a one-time experience. I would most likely not go back again. The service was great and the servers were all really nice people!",3 star rating,Joyce X.

They were out what I wanted to order so I opted for another choice, only to be met with ""that's it?!"" From the lady taking our order... we stopped by on Valentines weekend so it was quite a long line that day, I understand she was probably overwhelmed. Great customer service can smooth over almost anything but the lack of detail and overall demeanor left me wanting more. No crab cracker or napkins with our to-go order. It was a tad strange to offer to-go crab with no proper utensils. I'll update the review if we go back and have a different experience.",2 star rating,Caitlin M.

1/2/2020,"Forest Park, IL","The best seafood we had on our entire CA coastal road trip. The oyster shooters were SO fresh, although on the smaller side in our opinion. We liked the Kumamoto and Laguna, which are the medium-size oyster variety. The lobster roll, lobster tacos, and shrimp tacos were delicious!!! The only thing was that the lobster was a little chewy, and could have been more tender. The flavor was incredible however. The prices for lobster and crab were pretty expensive though. There is quite a long waitlist during peak times, and you have to put your name down and wait to be seated. There is only a single person restroom available inside the restaurant, which was a major pitfall. You would have better luck walking back on the wharf to use the public restrooms. The interior is quite small, which explains the long wait. But it is worth it.",5 star rating,Linda N.

We waited for almost 1.5hrs to be seated, but it was definitely worth the wait! Great food along with a wonderful view of the sky and sunset. Our dining experience was wonderful mainly because of our waiter Johnny. Johnny is such a hard working and all-around employee -- from assisting guests to be seated, clearing out tables, taking orders, packing take out orders, and answering to antsy guests (such as ourselves) questioning how much longer is the wait. Despite the busyness of a Friday night, he manages to compose himself with such professionalism and grace.

5/29/2020,"CA, CA","I just had a feeling I should've gone with the clam chowder or the lobster bisque. Came here with my wife on a Friday and there was a line of people waiting to order. Everyone on Yelp loves this place so we had to try it out. My wife got the ceviche (which she loved) and I got the fried seafood goodies.I requested to swap out fried oysters for additional seafood and I got 2 whole onion rings. LMAO. It was... okay. They only have cocktail sauce, ranch and tartar for dipping which was disappointing. I do wish they had at least fries to go with the fried foods. What made this plate really bad for me was the fact that this was $16-17 + tax and tip. So pretty much a $20 plate for so little food. For that reason, I definitely don't feel like it's worth the fried plate, but definitely worth it if you try their other menu items.",3 star rating,Robin C.

I dropped a small piece of lobster and that was pretty much the bulk of all the lobster we were given. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters. They were good, but you won't like them if you have high expectations. They're were mostly filled with spinach.

Got there 10 minutes after they opened but the outdoor seatings were already full!Their seafood is really fresh. The scallops and shrimps in the pasta were superb. They are not shy on the amount of the lobster in my lobster roll, but not the best taste I've ever had. If the bread can be toasted more would be much better. However, all the above food we got lacks flavor, the seafood in them was outstanding, but they have bland noodles and bread. The ice tea we got was horrible, very bitter. They were also out of uni that day (told us they sold all of them at the opening time lol). Serve was not bad though and the waiting time for food was short.Overall, I suggest ordering pure seafood items without bothering to try any of their carbohydrates.",4 star rating,Xinting Y.

2/19/2021,"Orange, CA","During covid times, I felt safe at this location - beautiful outdoor seating, overlooking the water. Lobster roll ratio (bread to lobster) was the best I've had in a while. Bread roll was buttery, crisp on the edges, fluffy and airy inside, but not too thick to overpower lobster. I've had too many lobster rolls where restaurants try to give you 20% lobster, 80% roll - no thanks. And the Mayo/sauce situation with little bits of crunchy (I believe it was small pieces of pickle)...yum!! Oysters were buttery and shucked perfectly; the night I went, I was given British colo, Washington, and Connecticut oysters. Clam chowder tastes like your grannies homemade one, filled with lots of big clam pieces, plus a hearty, cream sauce (bit of that liquified shit) what felt like was simmering for hours and hours.

And if the saltwater tanks lining the kitchen are any indication, it definitely is the freshest seafood you'll find.I always spend too much here, and it is always always always worth it. I visit Santa Barbara often for work, and every time I try a new seafood restaurant, it never even comes close to Santa Barbara Seafood Company.Uni is a real treat. Even if you think you like it well enough, I urge you to try it here. I was lucky enough to visit when they were serving a special uni dish with scallop and I couldn't get over how incredible it was.I'm a New Englander by birth and the clam chowder is the best I've had outside of Cape Cod on the East Coast. It's SO fresh, SO flavorful, and the hint of bacon doesn't overpower the delicate clams.

We were much happier with Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Oyster and Scallop plate than the sandwich. You could tell the seafood was really fresh.

8/10/2020,"Fremont, CA","Recently stopped by the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company after a day out with family and unfortunately our experience was lackluster. We put our name down on the list (only two parties ahead of us) and waited in front of the restaurant. We watched another party of two get seated before us, even though their name was before plenty of others that had already been crossed off. I personally don't think that's very fair to the people who had been waiting for a table. Even though there was only two names ahead of us on the list, getting seated took particularly long. There were tables left open and dirty for quite some time before anyone was being seated. We were told they weren't seating because they had to update their specials board???   In terms of COVID and safety precautions, we felt like SB Shellfish Company fell short. It didn't seem like there were any bussers to clean tables, only servers, which only becomes a problem when they have to stack peoples' dirty dishes up their arms to bring back to the kitchen and then re-emerge with clean plates full of food. The servers seemed so busy, I hope they were able to find the time to wash their hands because they were not wearing any gloves.   Clam Chowder was good. Happy with how fast it came out because we were starving, but there's nothing extraordinary about this soup. It was nice to have a warm soup though cause it was cold out! Crab Sandwich was okay.    However, we were deeply unsatisfied with the Lobster Roll. It needed much more seasoning and either more butter or some type of mayo in there. What the lobster roll did have was waaaay too many capers. We tried our best to finish the lobster roll, but something about the taste was very off-putting. Onion rings were decently sized and crunchy but definitely needed some type of sauce on the side. Views were nice and parking is free for the first 90 minutes. We wish this place had more to offer, as we were very excited to try it out. Because there are so many good reviews on yelp, we are hoping our experience was the product of an ""off-day"". But sadly, there seems to be little incentive to return.",2 star rating,Maya M.

Hardcore tourist who like to battle over outdoor seating and the best place to stand and get a photo. Needless to say, they don't have enough picnic tables and most of the ones they do have don't have umbrellas. So what am I suppose to do? Get take out and fight seagulls and tourists for a seat? Or walk a seafood plate down the board walk so it goes bad in the California sun. Lastly, the reason this place is for the birds is because a pack of hungry seagulls tore my $30 lunch to shreds while I was getting some water. I wish I took a picture.",2 star rating,C.J. B.

9/16/2020,"San Diego, CA","I am surprised that I haven't wrote a review for this wonderful place! We have visited Santa Barbara about 3 times and this is a must stop for us when we are there. Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is located the end of the pier and has indoor and outdoor seating. Even before the pandemic, we usually order takeouts and just seat at the tables right outside the restaurant to enjoy their fabulous food. This place is extremely popular so the wait time for indoor/outdoor seating is usually long. If you want to order takeouts, you can order it at the side of the restaurant and pick up there without how much of a line. Our absolute favorite is their steamed local rock crab! The whole crab was just steamed so the flavor of crab is absolutely preserved within its shells! It's so delicious! The price of the crab is very reasonable for just about $30. Although it can be difficult to eat since you must break these hard shells to get to the meat, the hard work is rewarded with absolute deliciousness of the sea! Their seafood is so fresh here so we love this place so much. We also tried couple other dishes here. Their steamed clams in white wine garlic broth was so amazing. We practically drank the broth since it was so delicious. Their lobster roll is also a very popular dish and very delicious. In comparison to other dishes, the lobster roll is slightly less impressive; however, it is still highly recommended and delicious.

They have bacon bits in it! The rock crab was surprisingly good (I don't usually eat crab haha)--very soft and buttery in texture. It was sweet on its own and didn't really need any extra sauce for dipping. The lobster tacos were good too and came with a lot of lobster pieces. Overall, great place to eat when you're in Santa Barbara! They're located at the end of the pier and there's free parking for the first 90 min. Service was also very friendly.

The service was great, we actually had a random plastic wrap in our crab sandwich, probably from packing the crab, so they took that off our bill. The seafood was so fresh, it was so delicious. I love the the sea urchin on top of the scallops & lime, it totally melts in your mouth and was an explosion of flavor! And you can never go wrong with lobster roll! It felt like the healthiest & tastiest lobster roll I've had because the ones I've had are usually cooked in so much butter and this was the opposite of buttery, which made it feel less sinful haha. We also had the dungeness crab louie and it was really flavorful, you can really taste the fresh crab.",5 star rating,Sara Nicole D.

I really enjoyed my clam linguini, perfect portion for a hungry gal like me. :)We also ordered the bread bowl clam chowder, it was alright, not amazing. The service was good, and surprisingly quick for such a busy place. I would definitely recommend sitting outside as we were all sweaty by the time we were done with our lunch. I would say, if you are looking for trendy, ocean views delicious and reasonably priced restaurant come here, you won't regret it. :)",5 star rating,Linette P.
8/15/2020,"Hillsboro, OR","Spent almost $80 including tip and both my boyfriend and I ended up having stomach pain and a bad start to a birthday weekend celebration. I tipped because they ""asked nicely"" for it, and the workers are nice (1 star). But quality of food is a diff story:I would say I have been here a handful of times in the past even tho I was never a big fan of coming here (other than it being the go-to when in SB). I wish I tried other outdoor dining restaurants as this is my first time traveling locally since start of COVID and didn't know what was opened! We just went to what we know is open. What a waste of time, money and stomach space. Do yourself a favor and go to another restaurant for seafood !! Most of the beach front restaurants around State St are open!Crab cake, lobster rolls and clam chowder used to be good- it was NOT at all what I remembered it to be. This is an honest review! I hate to do this to business but ... if they were to start a new yelp link, they would most likely NOT BE a 4 star.",1 star rating,Crystal H.

9/10/2019,"North Hollywood, CA","After hearing about their yummy Crab Louie salad from my bf who grew up coming here, I knew we had to make a stop. Stopped by for lunch this weekend and got supremely lucky: aside from the gorgeous day outside, my bf and I only waited about 5 minutes after putting our names down on the list! Sat inside at the bar and the speedy server got our order and food out in no time. Sadly they were out of the local box crab (boo, next time!) so we opted for the rock crab and, of course, the Crab Louie salad. The salad isn't quite what I thought it would be. When I think of a Louie, I think of a crab or shrimp salad that has mayo/sauce/seasoning mixed in. This was more like a Cobb salad. It was very good, just not what I expected. The rock crab was tender (and just a smidge undercooked at some points) and came with a side of onion rings. I love me some onion rings and these were perfectly cooked! I will say it could have used some seasoning as it was a bit bland, but not a big problem. Parking was either complimentary valet or self parking on the boardwalk. The staff were friendly and speedy. It's a little cozy in the indoor seating area (basically just the bar area or on the bar along the wall) but the outside seating is a bit of a wait, depending when you go. I definitely want to come back and try the other delicious looking shellfish items, like the box crab and the lobster roll. Yum!",5 star rating,Patricia G.

12/31/2019,"Oxnard, CA","One of my favorite spots to grab fresh seafood! This place is usually really busy on the weekends.You can dine in or order from the take out area by the side of the restaurant and dine casually in the patio. You can order from the window and stay close by because they will yell out the order numbers when they are ready.The lobster roll is really good. They give you generous portions of lobster. The lobster tacos are also very delicious. If you love uni, you need to try their scallop and uni special. You can still see the spiny needles move around once your order is ready. They also have the best clam chowder! The clam chowder has amazing flavor. It's creamy and filled with generous amounts of clams.You can park for free for 90 minutes at the harbor.Definitely a great place to grab some fresh seafood with a lovely view of the harbor especially on a warm and sunny day.",5 star rating,Lily Y.
1/3/2020,"Los Angeles, CA",This place always have a queue. The trick is to get there at just after they open for a brunch/lunch or mid afternoon for some seafood indulgences. There usually are crab deals and seasonal local catches. So fresh! I'd recommend a bar seat (action seats) or outside in the patio or even order to-go to have on the pier or beach somewhere. That uni on scallops... mmmm,5 star rating,Eunice C.
8/19/2020,"Irvine, CA","The food here was yummy, great view (right on the pier) and the wait was fair (approx. 30 min for a party of 2 and a pup).Grabbed lunch here on Saturday, arrived around 1:00 and sat around 1:30. Ordered the- clam chowder, scallop ceviche, lobster roll and box crab. Clam chowder was really good, loved the added bacon bits (bacon is always a plus), the ceviche was fresh and the ratio between the ceviche to lime/tomato was good, the lobster roll was ok (I always forget the lobster is served cold) - in my mind I was thinking a warm roll, the box crab was really sweet (just a lot of work, lol - crack, scoop, peel).The staff were friendly, service was fast.Tips - bring a light jacket, it sure does get windy and pretty chilly. Smaller parties typically get seated faster. Hang around the restaurant after placing your name down- they call your name and if you aren't there well you missed your chance.Would definitely recommend and go back again.",5 star rating,Liah T.
1/19/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Maybe it was the fact that we ate in instead of getting it to go, but I had a pretty rough go eating here. My party of three waited on their list for a while (20 min?) to get seated and the food was a bit overpriced... for what I got, anyway (shrimp tacos). For ppl considering, keep in mind that the indoors is primarily a bar (no tables, just counters) Anyway, once we got seated, the service was slowwwww - even to get our biIl! It might have just been us, though, since a couple of parties who got seated after us got served and left before us (a party of three). Maybe your experience will be better than ours, but just keep the following in mind when you go:- long wait list- Indoors has no tables- Avoid the shrimp tacos",2 star rating,Stuart M.
8/17/2020,"San Diego, CA","I feel terrible giving a bad review but I kind of think it's important to since it seemed this place had great reviews. We ordered everything. Lobster bisque, lobster tacos, crab cake sandwich, oyster shooter, and shrimp ceviche. Crab cake was super bland no flavor and dry. Lobster bisque was just straight butter. Lobster tacos were so oily and buttery. A lot of the over buttered made me think they were covering bad seafood. I have the worst stomach ache from sampling. Food was bland and way too over buttered.  Pricing was pretty fair and they give a good amount of food but the quality was pretty terrible. Would prefer way less food and for it to just be better.Thank god there is a public restroom not too far away me and my friends all felt pretty sick and had bad stomach pains",1 star rating,Jackie W.
8/2/2019,"Queens, NY","Was taking a day trip to Santa Barbara and saw this cute little seafood shack on the wharf. There was a decent amount of people waiting outside and a clipboard to add your name in the front. Once we got seated service and food was friendly and fast. I got the steamed clams in white wine sauce which were super fresh and delicious. Served with warm and a little charred bread. The broth is light but also a little creamy, loved it. The clams themselves were super pretty too. My boyfriend got the steamed crab with slaw and onion rings, the meat was insanely fluffy and just fell apart once you got it out of the shell. We happened to be there while Man vs. Food was filming and got invited to join the show! They brought out the uni on scallop and lime and chapino for us to try on camera. While being on the show was super cool, the food was unfortunately left out for a while waiting for the shoot and got a little cold. I love uni and the uni was sooo fresh, super rich and creamy. Unfortunately not a huge scallop fan so wasn't sure how I felt about the pairing. The chapino is essentially this seafood stew served in a bread bowl. While it looked awesome, I felt the sauce was too heavy for the delicate seafood, almost like a pasta sauce. However, my boyfriends mom had ordered it for lunch and seemed to really enjoy it so perhaps it would have been a lot better if it hadn't been cold. Prices are affordable, especially for such a great location. Put your name down, wander the wharf a little, and maybe you'll get to see some seals like we did!",4 star rating,Alice R.

The shrimp ceviche was also just okay, I'm Hispanic and I'm used to a lot more flavor in my ceviche, I wouldn't order it again. Now those crab legs though, those were AMAZING!

6/14/2019,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA","I keep finding my way back to this place time and time again. I found this place in my early college years and I find myself coming back here once again.I think this town has a special way that tugs at the core of your heart that has you coming back for more no matter how much time passes over the years.  I felt lucky to be passing through while celebrating a handful of birthdays for my dearest friends. It was such a delight to get to celebrate in such great company, surrounded by friends, and to top it off with such amazing food. This place is like a souvenir you keep tucked away in your heart because every time you walk up that pier you fall right back in love with the dark wooden oak that constructs the structure, the gentle sounds of the waves crashing alongside you as you take a huge breath of the air while you're walking to the point.    Once you find parking on the pier and you start to take your leisurely stroll up to the tips of the pier it is really hard to steer away from their display of fresh lively crustaceans that are exploring in their tanks. The little ones are always fascinated and adults alike. At the Santa Barbara Food Company, their food is as fresh as can be swimming lively minutes before they are served to you. They have rock crabs, lobsters, live uni, crab cakes, & so much more. The food and the experience always feels priceless because of the company that traveled with you on that journey to get there. You just have to anticipate the possible wait time during high seasons and rush hours.",4 star rating,Jennifer C. L.

1/31/2021,"Corona, CA",Loved then food! I got oyster shooters super fresh and delicious. The waiter was helpful and informative about how each oyster tasted whether it was salty or sweet. As my main meal I got the Cioppino in a bread bowl. I'm being honest I've had better only because I love mine with more broth (the bread absorbs it) and I prefer a little less tomato flavor and more zesty but still a very good Cioppino don't get me wrong! But for me the winner was the Maine Lobster! They didn't have their local lobster this time due to economic conflict of China buying it all up and making the demand price way higher meaning $75- $100 lobster for us hence they stuck w the Maine lobster for $35. Hey I'll take $35 lobster over $75 any day! It was absolutely delish and very meaty! So I had nothing to complain about. Oh except that there was no Uni when we went 1/30/21 but that's because rainstorm hit the day before which made it unsafe for them to dive for those fresh local Uni. I'll definitely be trying it someday!,5 star rating,Kathleen N.
6/5/2019,"La Puente, CA","I've heard that the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a must whenever one visits the area, so on our little road trip, we made a stop for lunch here.  It was a Sunday and we arrived at about 12:30 pm and we didn't get seated until about 1:45, so definitely make some time for this place.  They do have a little window on the side where you can just take your plates to the tables outside but it's all exposed to the seagulls trying to steal your food so we didn't opt for that.  There's parking right on the wharf free for 90 minutes, but we didn't know so we ended up finding unlimited parking for free out on the street.  It was a good thing we did though, because we spent well over 90 minutes for this whole thing.  The inside is all bar seating and the outside is all booth seating, so if you don't mind sitting at a bar, then definitely put ""First Available"" when you sign your name in on the waitlist because more people are going to want to put ""Outside"" as their preferred seating.  We ordered the Live Sea Urchin ($21.95), Local Rock Crab Special ($28.95), Garlic Baked Clams ($14.95), Shrimp Ceviche ($13.95), and the Lobster Roll ($19.95).  Between the 4 of us, it was just enough food to get us to a decent level of fullness, but not completely stuffed.  The uni and the rock crab special were the more popular dishes that everyone seems to get, but I really liked the garlic baked clams the best, just because it's way easier to get the meat out and it has a lot of flavor to it.  The uni was still good, but judging from other peoples' photos and looking around at other peoples' plates the scallops under our uni didn't look nearly as big as theirs, so the sizes aren't consistent and we were a bit disappointed.  The crab was huge, and it was a good thing that it came with onion rings because I don't think I would have gotten full from just the crab.  They give it to you with some lemon, butter, and cocktail sauce so that you can dip the crab in it as well.  It does get messy when you eat it, so be sure to put your phone away so that it doesn't end up smelling like crab for the rest of the day.  The shrimp ceviche looks like a lot, but in reality they just pile the ceviche on a bed of lettuce so that it looks like it's more than it really is.  I'd rather they just put what they're giving us in a bowl rather than have it being deceiving.  The ceviche itself was really good though, it was very light and refreshing.  The lobster roll was good as well.  I think if you wanted to get full from just one dish, you would be good with just this one, because it also comes with cole slaw and onion rings.  It's really light and the bread isn't too hard either so I could still bite through it with braces.  However, the bread was burnt when we got it. Everything you get here is really fresh, which is probably why this place is so popular.  Overall, it's all pretty good, but it's nothing too different or unique from other seafood places that I can find in San Diego.  I don't think I'd wait over an hour for this again, but maybe I'd come back when it's not during peak hours.",3 star rating,Jenny T.

We signed our name on a roster and patiently waited for an inside table. The server informed us there was seating outside. However due to one of our parties having bronchitis we asked to please sit inside. The server kept insisting outside and we kindly told him we would wait for an inside table. We stood there and two of our members of our party sat down. (Both 70 years of age - they both don't do well standing for long periods) and two people stood up while reading the menu. Then another female server came and told us to stand elsewhere because we were ""hovering over customers""That was exceptionally rude. We barely stood there and she was giving us attitude.

5/20/2019,"Anaheim, CA",After walking all over SB and the pier I decided for an early dinner and chose the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company from my selection. This is my second visit but my first review. Location: The Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is located on the far end of the pier on the right-hand side. The pier offers free parking for the first 90 minutes and it should be plenty of time if you just coming here for dinner. Atmosphere: This place kicks butt and it's beautiful decorated. The inside seating is very tight with mostly bar seating. They do have a nice patio but during my visit it was too windy and cold to sit outside. Food: I choose the Clam Linguine and it didn't disappoint. The Linguine had a nice bite to it and the clams where very tasty. The butter sauce with garlic and parsley was the bomb. I loved how the managed to have the clams taste so different. Verdict: Hands-down a solid 5 for great tasting and reasonable priced food plus friendly service.

5/26/2020,"San Jose, CA","We were excited to eat here, after seeing 4 stars on almost 2000 reviews. We ordered 2 clam chowder bowls and ""shrimp and chips"". First, the ""shrimp & chips"". I asked if they had fish & chips, the guy at the register told me no but they have ""shrimp & chips"". I only ordered it so I could share the fries with my son. Well, there were no ""chips"", just 6 pieces of average sized fried shrimp, 2 large slices of onion rings, and coleslaw. So basically, for $16 (??) I paid for fried shrimp and onion rings. It was crunchy, so I'll give it a star for that, but the shrimp was overcooked. Now onto the clam chowder. We ordered 2 bread bowls. There's about 75% bread and 25% chowder. According to my husband, it tasted ""cheesy"". To me and my daughter, it lacked flavor. At almost $11/bowl, it wasn't worth it. I'll give it another star for an epic view, given that it's the last restaurant on the pier. But I wouldn't eat here again. I saw several people with pasta. Maybe I should've gone with that. ‍*editing to add: I don't actually know how much the fried shrimp cost me. I wasn't given a receipt with the breakdown. My total was $42 plus some change.  $10.95 for clam chowder, leaves about $20 left, knock off a few bucks for tax, I guessed $16. Now looking at their menu and prices, I see I was ripped off.

6/27/2020,"San Rafael, CA","When down by the amazing beaches in Santa Barbara, the seafood restaurants call my name. I just had to try out the famous seafood in Santa Barbara. We went to the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company, and we had to wait a bit for a seat. We were pretty excited because we saw tons of people enjoying various seafood dishes. They sure do have a lot of dishes to choose from. We decided to order the lobster roll, clam chowder, and two types of pasta dishes. I loved the lobster roll. It had such big, succulent pieces of lobster. The toasted roll and the light coating of mayo accompanied the lobster perfectly. And the onion rings that came with the dish were a definite, delicious bonus! The lobster roll was the highlight of the meal.The chowder and pastas were alright. The chowder itself was yummy, however, I was not a fan of the bread bowl. I'm from San Francisco where sourdough reigns supreme so this bread did not meet my expectations. As for the pastas, we ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta and the lobster pasta. They both had a similar white wine reduction sauce that I did not really care for. I had a lot of hope for this restaurant, but perhaps I just ordered the wrong things. If I visit again, I will try ordering something else that hopefully will turn out great like the lobster roll.",3 star rating,Jocelyn T.
8/3/2020,"Simi Valley, CA",The best Uni I've ever eaten. First time trying it and i loved it. So fresh and just melts in your mouth. They serve it on top of a lime and scallop. Mmmmmm so delicious.

4/12/2019,"Alhambra, CA","Saw the great reviews from Yelp, and convinced my boyfriend to take me to Stearns Wharf to try out the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.  So glad that Stearns Wharf offers 90 minutes free parking and have free valet parking service available.  But trust me... 90 minutes isn't enough to get in and out of here because I had to wait almost 45 minutes for a spot at this restaurant (and this is during the California winter months in February). Santa Barbara Shellfish Company does not take any restaurants.  You can sign in on the clipboard upon arrival designating which seating area you prefer.  Outdoor seating is lovely (when it is not cold and windy).  I opted for indoor seating because the wind was blowing everything away.  Unfortunately, everyone felt the same way and wanted to sit indoors.  I was rubbing cheeks with the person sitting next to me, and made my entire dining experience uncomfortable.Ordered the following items:1) Lobster Bisque - Hot and welcoming, and they literally serve you in a cup when you ordered a cup.  Probably the cheapest item on the menu.  Delicious.2) Scallops Ceviche - Fresh seafood, but I have had better.3) Abalone - Sliced into 4 pieces and served over rice.  It's fresh & tender.  But nothing to rave home about.  Personally, I didn't care for the rice.4) Uni and Scallops - I have had better Santa Barbara Uni.  While it is fresh, I have had better uni and scallop combo at other sushi restaurant.  I would say ""Skip this"" on this item.Overall, everyone was ok, but I have had better seafood.  Personally, I felt it was a little overpriced.  Not worth the wait.  Highly recommend waiting for a table outdoors to enjoy the view and eat with some personal space.",3 star rating,Anita L.

Not the end of the world but we lost our appetite. He was handling the tables along the railing, BTW.  We wanted to tell him of the problem but our server was no where to be found.  Happens.  After 17 minutes I asked another server to contact our server.  When he came to our table I showed him the hair.  His initial response was ""would you like another bowl?""  Not ""sorry .""  At that point I told we would be leaving.  His response: ""okay.""  Again, no sorry, no contrition.""  He did not charge for the soup but did for the $3.50 ice tea.  How tacky is that?",2 star rating,Michael L.

The only thing was they clean the whole shell, which means you can't enjoy the tomalley (which tastes amazing!) price is also high for a hole in the wall, but it is Santa Barbara after all!

At this time, the quarantine was being slowly lifted so the restaurant was offering outside seating. We ordered fresh uni/scallop, rock crab and the lobster bisque . While I learned Santa Barbara uni is often bragged about, I felt the scallop was the actual star of this dish. The scallops were so fresh and didn't have any fishiness to them. The crab was perfectly seasoned with natural seawater. Lastly the lobster bisque was my favorite dish. Full of lobster meat, tomato and a hint of citrus, this may have been the most flavorful lobster bisque I've ever had.",4 star rating,Stephanie H.

I will literally plan a road trip to Santa Barbara just to have lunch here, it's that freakin' tasty! It's a rather shmall location, it sits at the very end of Stearns Wharf, you can sit inside (limited seating) or outside where there's larger tables. They also have a window on the side of the building that allows you to order & sit in the picnic style tables on the pier to eat-- if you choose not to wait. My favorites:-Classic Clam Chowder-Scallop Ceviche (if this had minced jalapeño added to it, ugh! It'd be even tastier!) It comes with homemade tortilla chips, it's light & lemony & just delicious. Mind you, I'm not a seafood person & I very much enjoy this scallop ceviche. -Cioppino it comes with hella seafood for $19& a Stella Artois to top it off Yum yum yummm This place also has another restaurant that it's tied to on Cabrillo blvd, at the foot of the pier & it's also super freakin delicious.

With the restaurant wait being over an hour, we decided to order our food from the side window and eat at one of the many benches outside. We decided to share a whole crab (wish I remembered which crab it was) and a cup of their bisque. Food came out a little slower, but both the crab and bisque were fresh. Only thing is that I wished the bisque came out hot instead of warm! Overall thought my experience here was pretty average.

So we decided to day trip to Santa Barbara and our first stop was the Santa Barbara Mission which is a must see by the way, but came right after to the Shellfish Company which is right off the dock of the pier. Many social distancing areas to feel at ease with a little crowd. Service was fast, within 10-15 minutes of our order. Perfect for a bite and site seeing for a while. The lobster roll was missing the big bang we looked for. The roll could have been a little more moist, less crunchy. Would have liked a nice side to compliment the lobster...a onion ring or two doesn't make the masterpiece. What about a nice roasted corn salad or maybe sweet potato fries to give some tang to the plate? The bread bowl for my chowder was also a little hard to dip with. Maybe it just needed a little more time in the oven. Overall, great lobster.",4 star rating,Christy R.

Literally just dry seasoning on calamari, coated in flour, and fried. It was dry, tough, and bland. The fried shrimp was also bland, but at least had breading.Rock crab: Got this because it's their specialty crab? Flavorless. Also what's the deal with their onion rings? Terrible. Lobster roll: Again, flavorless! I've had better lobster rolls at disneyland. The bun was missing some butter and was dry. The lobster, while generous in portions, was missing some sort of butter/seasoning as well. Clam chowder: Was decent and probably the best thing we had. Probably pushed the rating up to 1.5 stars. All the entrees came with coleslaw. I love coleslaw but there's was terrible. No flavor whatsoever, none of the trademark tang that coleslaw is known for. Everything was bland bland bland!Service was also whatever. I thought the server would mention about how our dishes were virtually untouched, but she must be used to it or know how bad their food is because she cleared our plates without blinking an eye.

The Box crab which is local to Santa Barbara was this prehistoric looking hard shell spiny crustacean with a sweet Dungeness meat that was plentiful as the crab came right out of the tank and into the steamer. The uni which was not available when we got there for lunch but the fisherman was coming in two hours later made the wait worth while as we came back and ordered from the take out window and prepared right out of the shell and served over scallop sashimi and lime slices.....spectacular!Eating right out of the ocean and sitting on the pier with 360 views of the Pacific is a really great experience.,4 star rating,Irwan A.
11/27/2018,"Carson, CA","Absolutely love this place! From the service to their food - one of the best seafood restaurants in Santa Barbara! Finished a wine tasting at Stearn's Wharf and I was starving! Yelped the nearest restaurant nearby and found Santa Barbara Shellfish Company  just a short 2 min walk away. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was bustling! We waited a good 15 minutes before getting seated. What really made our visit was our server Prospero - He gave us top notch, 5 star service. I was debating between 2 sets of wines and gave me a sample of both AND then some. Also gave us amazing food recommendations: clam linguine pasta (best thing on the menu!) and an order of the seafood sampler platter. We sparked up some conversation and he gave us recommendations on where to go and what to see during our short Santa Barbara stay. He was very welcoming and kind. Till this day I'm still dreaming of their clam linguine pasta. It's usually my go-to dish at seafood restaurants but this place tops it as the best one. Creamy, fresh, and full of flavor. Definitely a must try when eating here! The seafood sampler platter was great too! If you're into deep fried seafood appetizers, this would be a good option! I believe you have a choice of 2-3 sea foods to choose from and it comes with huge onion rings as well. The calamari was our favorite. The deep fried oyster wasn't that great.

Situated on the SB pier is this tiny little restaurant that dished up some delicious seafood pasta. My husband and I absolutely loved the Shrimp + Scallop Linguine and the Clams Linguine! The shrimp and scallops linguine was a tad bit superior to the clams because the fresh basil and roasted tomatoes added gave it an excellent taste. Hands down, one of the best things I have ever had!TIPS:-Wait for your name to be called at the front of the restaurant. The waiters will not call your name loud and they don't go around looking for you if you're wandering around the pier. If you don't respond, they move on quickly!-Pick F/A (first available) when signing up for a table. It's not a fancy dine-in place to sit for a long time and enjoy the view from the restaurant.

8/8/2019,"Westlake Village, CA","On our second visit to Santa Barbara Shellfish, at the end of Stern's Wharf, it is confirmed. This restaurant serves fresh, well prepared, delicious seafood. Really very very good. 'Twas a beautiful afternoon in Santa Barbara, as we put our name on the list outside the front door. We had a whole page of names before us, but between people not there when called, and the relatively fast turnaround, we waited only about 15 minutes.  Besides, you're out on the ocean in Santa Barbara. There are a lot of worse places in the world you could be waiting for a table. This restaurant serves some unique local items, like Santa Barbara rock crab, uni, and abalone. I'd say the majority of diners were working on some serious looking rock crab, but I opted for the Dungeness crab cocktail. Nailed it. Best I've had, or at least tied with Musso and Frank Grill. I also had the abalone, which was delicious served over a bed of fantastic rice. Abalone isn't quite the same as it was years ago. This was smaller, but from what I was told, about 4 years old. Still, I hadn't had it in so long, and I really enjoyed it. I will let my photos do the rest of the talking. All I can say is that I cannot wait to go again.",5 star rating,Steve R.

Granted it is January and we are right by the harbor but it couldn't have been this cold the moment it came out of the kitchen and onto our table. I ordered clam chowder & lobster pasta. My boyfriend got the uni and scallop & lobster roll. He said he enjoyed them both, although he wasn't quite sure if the uni & scallop were worth their price. I loved the clam chowder - so much meat in it and it didn't feel like it was just all soup. Unfortunately, today was the day that I found out I am lactose intolerant so I didn't react well to the soup. My pasta was very flavorful, however. Big chunks of lobster in it!! Well worth its price.Service was phenomenal - very nice and prompt. The wait time wasn't terrible, and I was surprised because it's New Year's Day! Parking wasn't too tough to find.

10/20/2020,"Laguna Niguel, CA","We got here on a Sunday an hour after they opened. Heard rave reviews so we were really excited. As soon as we were seated, we asked about their famous uni and were told they ran out the night before. What? How is a famous, popular seafood spot out of seafood right when they open? Had we known, we would have kept driving. Then the server recommends oysters and we order two dozen just be told ten minutes later, that they are also out but she would substitute for something else similar. I don't think she knows her oysters because what she gave us was salty and not melon like the ones we wanted. Strike two. We ordered the rock crab and the claw meat was tasty but it was really hard to get to the meat everywhere else. The clam chowder was excellent. The bisque just tasted like cream. The seafood pasta was bland. The cioppino was good but a little watery and the bay scallops were bland like they were added after. The crab sandwich was good. The best thing here? The Bloody Mary. Aside from the ambiance, which is amazing, the food here is overrated in my opinion.",3 star rating,L H.
6/24/2019,"Alhambra, CA","After an adventurous day with the boyfriend, we managed to squeeze in a little more adventure. We had stopped by the ostrichland, Solvang, and decided since its on our way home.. Santa Barbara! We ended up walking on the pier until the end and came across this little shack for food. They do have a wait if youd wanna eat inside. However, they do have an outside to-go style on the other side of the restaurant. Also they have benches to eat outside as well. The boothang and I ended up getting the steam whole crab and bread bowl clam chowder. First things first, we came during sunset and golden hour so the view was GORGEOUS! Also, unlike other piers it was well kept and clean. The cashier for the shack was very friendly and had a great go - to attitude. Our food was out in less than 20 mins. **Clam Chowder** - Pretty bomb, had good flavor. Wasnt lacking anything.** Steam Crab** The crab was actually super meaty and fresh. It came with an onion ring and coleslaw. The coleslaw is pretty bland and not so great at all.Overall the experience went very well here. Loved it! Also, when I was cracking the steamed crab all the juices flew on the boyfriend and we both couldnt help but laugh lolll. Good memories!",4 star rating,Judy E.
8/10/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","As a local, I have seen how restaurants are handling things during COVID and I think this place needs to take some notes. The line to eat here or order food to go is unbelievably long all weekend. Everyone says the line is worth it, but not in my case. We went for the lobster rolls, which everyone else in line wanted to order as well. By the time we made it to the window they had already sold out of the lobster rolls. The amount of people they had to tell they were out of lobster was shocking. Each person who went up the the window after us in line asked for the same thing and got the same answer. How frustrating it must be for that girl to have to repeat herself to every customer that the lobster is out! They should have a sign to put up which announces they're out of the lobster, so people waiting in the line for hours don't have to change their order last second under pressure when they find out at the window they can't order the lobster. The wharf was so crowded, we decided to order our crab to-go. That was the first thing we told the gal at the window because she kept having to pack up the food as people decided last minute to change their orders for to-go. We decided on the crab, since lobster was out. Not cheap, which was fine because we will pay up for something like that with high expectations. What a disappointment. After our number was finally called, the food was not packed up in to-go boxes. It was set on plates for us to take to the picnic tables, which were so overcrowded and not cleaned. We reminded her we ordered the food to-go (This happened to the couple right before us too). She reluctantly packed it up for us. When we got home we unpacked everything and there were no onion rings, which were supposed to come with the crab meals. We quickly got over that because we were excited to have crab. Well, the crab was undercooked, almost raw. All in all, waste of money and waste of time. Do not recommend and will never go there again. Also I want to make clear that I cannot imagine how stressful that job is for the woman at the window right now. They were extremely understaffed (obviously due to Covid) and she had a lot to keep track of. A sign to put up when lobster is out would make her job a lot easier so she wouldn't have to explain to every hopefully customer that they can't get lobster rolls. The wharf clearly has no restrictions put in place right now for Covid so I would stay away from that area if I were you.",2 star rating,Cat D.
7/12/2018,"Irvine, CA","This could very well be a tourist trap, but overall, the seafood we had was very fresh. SB Shellfish Company is located at the very end of the pier. There's limited seating inside and uncovered outdoor seating that is dog friendly. We decided to order to-go at the window and found a table under an umbrella on the pier. What we ordered:Clam chowder: pretty good. Not too thick and we were happy with the clam to potato ratio. Sea urchin scallop appetizer: SO FRESH! Beautiful presentation. Loved this dish.Steamed mussels and clams: delicious! The broth is like crack. We asked for extra bread just so we could soak up and devour the extra broth. Lobster roll: pretty good. But not as good as one from Boston. But hey, we aren't on the East coast. Crab roll: not good. Lacked flavor and the bread was dry.  Onion rings come with all the sandwiches: quite possibly the best onion rings I've ever had. So crispy! Calamari pasta: such a simple dish but executed perfectly. Great, fresh flavors, generous calamari portions, and perfectly al dente linguine. YUM! We were very happy with our meal here!

1/25/2020,"Irvine, CA","Honestly, this place seems a bit overpriced. We ate inside.There wasn't a long wait. We had their ceviche, uni special, and abalone entree.The price is very high for what you get. I'm not one to balk at absolute dollar amounts, but the premium, to me, seemed to have more to do with the fact it was a tourist location, rather than any quality or innovation. 1) The ceviche was very expensive (around $16). At first, I thought it was worth it because the bowl it came in looked to be a wine glass amount... but it turned out that half the bowl was nothing but shredded lettuce. It wasn't mixed with the ceviche, which was on top. What the hell?2) Uni special was fresh uni on scallop with a bit of sauce. Six pieces for over $20. I know we didn't come at prime uni time, but the uni was NOT good at all. I know not all uni can be perfect, sweet, and delicious... but the uni barely had any flavor at all. It was really disappointing. The sauce was also incredibly sour/salty, which made the whole thing salty. Fresh scallop and high quality uni, in my experience, has always been slightly sweet. The whole dish wasn't bad, but not worth the price at all.3) The abalone was delicious. It's hard to fuck up abalone. The rice dish was also good, though it was very under-salted. A bit more salt and acid would have really brought out the richness of the dish.I wouldn't come back. I was curious about their oysters, but the prices on them were absurd. I can find Kumamoto oysters for way cheaper in SoCal.",3 star rating,Justina H.
3/2/2020,"Moraga, CA","One of my must go place every time I am in Santa Barbara.  Just a solid, good, comfort food for super fresh seafood with great service and a nice selection of beers.  They serve a pretty good mitchelada and Bloody Mary too.Depending on the season but if they ever have the spider crab, you must get it.  It's taste similar to the fresh Alaskan king, not the frozen legs kind, sweet and delicate. I wonder if they ever have Fresh Alaskan King that's the ultimate best crab in the world!!!! But the box crab and the rock crab is also delicious.If you are an Uni lover the Uni here is wriggling fresh, it's practically still moving while you eating it...I know sound weird but it's the best when you can have live urchin...they served it up on top of a piece of sashimi scallop and lime.The seafood linguine is also delish...we have been here quite a bit and had not have a bad meal.  Not to mention the giant onion ring, crispy and sweet just a great paring to the steam shell fish.They also have fresh abalone if you are in the mood for one.My eyes tend to be always bigger than my stomach hence all the food just for 2 but how can I help myself when the food is amazing right, you should have seen the people next to us they were so inspired they all each order the spiny lobster too, I should get commission from the restaurant...lol for helping them sell the food....so eat up those sweet thing you won't regret it!!!!",5 star rating,Toni L.

The onion rings were nice and the small side salad was okay. The food was out pretty quickly and staff was cool. This place gets really crowded throughout the day and doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Parking on the pier is a nightmare if you show up midday on the weekend.

6/9/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","This place should be the busiest seafood restaurant in Santa Barbara and it was my second time to dine here. Honestly the first experience wasn't that impressive, so I didn't have much experience this time but wanted to take my friend anyway as it's a must try restaurant for visitors. As usual, there was long waiting list and we prepared to wait at least one hour but for some reasons people ahead of us disappeared but we were able to get seated within half an hour. We ordered box crab, oysters, sea urchin on scallops, clam linguini and abalone on rice. We've never had box crab before but it was the waiter's recommendation and we tried out of curiosity. And BOMB! OMG, I've never had such thing like this in my whole life. It's not the ordinary crab you've had before, as soon as you have one bite of it you'll be in heaven on earth! It's unbelievably soft, milky and just soooooooooo yummy! I don't even have a word for it! I almost cried! Geez, I would drive 4 hours round trip from LA just to eat it! And for oysters and sea urchin on a scallops, they weren't beyond what I've expected but were fresh enough. Problems were other two dishes which were clam linguini and abalone. It was first time I tried clam linguini in a cream sauce and it honestly taste kinda odd to me. The biggest disappointment was the abalone on rice and it was just too sour and didn't taste good at all. Overall, my experience was great just because of the amazing box crab and I guess it can be quite a hit or miss depends on what you order. The box crab is only seasonal menu so if they have it when you're there, YOU'RE THE LUCKY ONE! Don't think twice to try this, I promise you that you won't be disappointed.",5 star rating,Ava L.
1/17/2021,"La Verne, CA","Im sorry but I just dont get it. Whats with the hype? We came here and the line was soo long. We waited in line for 30 mins plus another 25ish minutes for our order to come out. The person taking our order was visibly impatient and answered our questions with 1 word. We ordered the lobster rolls, calamari sandwich, the fried variety that includes calamari, shrimp, oysters and scallops. Also ordered the crab cakes and french fries. The food was DRIPPING in oil. This place takes god knows how many orders a day and all these people seem to have no problem with oily greasy and under/overcooked food??? The fries were raw. My 2 year old was disgusted because they were wet and crunching. I didnt believe her til i tried them myself. The calamari and shrimp were like rubber. I had to spit out the calamari because it would not break up in my mouth no matter how hard i chewed. All it did was let out oil in my mouth. The lobster rolls to be fair had a heaping portion of lobster, but why was the bread hard?? Is this how its supposed to be? Ive had lobster rolls before and the bread has never been this dry and almost stale like. The crab cakes were also soaked in oil. Every bite, all i could taste is oil. We drove all the way from Orange County to eat here and we are very very disappointed and will not recommend this place to anyone, if anything we will tell people to stay away. Waste of money and time and If they hadnt closed by the time we finished eating I would have went back and asked for a refund.",1 star rating,Reem Z.

There was a line out the door at this place but we waited and were glad we did!We ordered the cioppino which comes in a bread bowl and an assortment of fried seafood. The prices were a little steep but I think it's generally how seafood runs. The cioppino was warm with tangy tomato flavor, and the only downside was that there was a LOT of bread compared to seafood.

We tried to order the spider crab and to our disappointment they didn't have any, so we went for the box crab. I can't stress enough that for 17.95 a lbs this is not worth it. The yield ofMeat is not nearly enough and we ordered a 3 lbs crab that cost 53 dollars!!! We should have ordered the rock crab. They recommended the clam chowder which I ordered in the bread bowl, and it turned out they were out of that too. We paid 100 dollars, including 3 beers and ran to another restaurant.

2/5/2020,"Tucson, AZ","Was looking for a quick seafood lunch and this placed delivered just that! You have the option of sitting outside right on the pier at a couple tables or inside at the bar right at the edge of the kitchen or at a couple stools at a counter. So definitely not a nice sit down restaurant, but if you are looking for a fun, quick seafood lunch where you can watch the chefs grab the fresh seafood out of the tanks and prepare it right in front of you, this is a great place for that. I mean, you don't get much fresher than them grabbing the massive crabs, lobsters, and abalone right out of the tanks and throwing them in the pan! The workers also took out lobsters and crabs to show customers who wanted the full animal. Definitely pricey, but you get what you are paying for (seafood, especially this fresh, is always going to be expensive though). My boyfriend got a lobster roll for $21 and it had the most lobster I've ever seen he served in a lobster roll. They actually open up the roll all the way and filled it to the brim with big chunks of lobster (instead of places that only cut the bread halfway down and you end up eating mostly bread at the bottom). I got the crab sandwich for $16 which had a decent amount of crab salad. Bread could have been a little more toasted, but that's just my preference. Both dishes came with huge onion rings and cole slaw. We also got half a dozen oysters to share and they were so fresh! Our lunch was very filling, but you don't feel weighed down because of all the fresh, light seafood. So overall, got just what we were looking for: casual, fresh seafood to round out our day in Santa Barbara. I guess the biggest thing to know is that if you feel that for the amount you pay that you should be getting a full-service, white cloth, sit down, this isn't the place.",4 star rating,Amanda N.

7/10/2018,"San Francisco, CA","Your typical tourist trap at the end of the pier with mediocre food, service and good views. 2.75 Stars. First, as with any tourist trap, be prepared to wait. There is very little shade if it's a hot day so keep that in mind. The actual restaurant doesn't have that much seating either so even if there aren't too many people, chances are it will still be at full capacity. The service was mostly adequate. Had to try hard to get their attention a few times and they weren't very attentive and never cleared our plates despite barely having any room for them. The food was... disappointing. We had the local crab, baked garlic clams, pasta with clams, and the uni (sea urchin) with scallops. The crab was just OK. It's definitely no King Crab but it isn't even close to Dungeness Crab either. Ironically, didn't taste all that fresh. It was easy to get the meat out so there's that.The baked garlic clams were probably the best dish. They were packed full of flavor and I'm sure the breadcrumbs, garlic, and Parmesan helped cover any imperfections and possible lack of freshness.The clam pasta was... atrocious. I've had better pasta from frozen microwave dinners. Calling this pasta is offensive to Italians! Needless to say, we only ate the seafood and left 90% of the ""pasta"" untouched.The biggest disappointment, however, was the uni with scallops. The scallops were actually pretty decent. Barely noticeable mild oceany flavor. The uni was.... come on! This is Santa Barbara Uni in Santa Barbara. Shouldn't get any fresher than this... but unfortunately it does. Sure, it was creamy and sweet but it was just off.But hey, maybe you come here for the amazing views! Which, mostly they are. But the inside seating with the dirty windows leaves you with less than a stellar views. It didn't help that the seafood smell was mixed in with smell of what I would assume was bleach or some other cleaning material. The outside view is great, expect for when it's a warm day and you are cooking harder than your dishes.Overall, I'd skip this place. There are much better seafood restaurants in the area.",3 star rating,Mario B.

The uni tasted super fresh and it went super well with the poached egg. I really wish I tried their uni special because that's six pieces of uni.-clam chowder: a bit bland.

Must get fresh, local seafood not smothered in mayo (lobster roll), batter or deep fried. Ask for lots of lime for your oyster and put generous amount of Tabasco! Uni and scallops were puny. Tiny portions and bitter. I'm sure its fresh but I've tasted way better uni (from Santa Barbara). Can't believe they are charging this much for such a bleak, low quality seafood. Crab was better than the uni/scallop dish. However, the crab was not those with packed meat nor ones they just caught. It lacked meat (imagine big hard shells with very little meat) and even with 3lb, we weren't full at all. If you enjoy fresh seafood, you'll be disappointed.

It was ehh. I thought it would be tastier since a lot of people rave about it. I would skip this.---Service---very tentative and friendly",3 star rating,Jessica J.
3/5/2019,"Irvine, CA","A great pier-side restaurant with decent seafood for a reasonable price. There's outside and inside seating, so sit outside during the day for a good view of the water. We ordered local lobster, some baked clams and I had an uni shooter. The lobster was flavorful with great grilled flavors. The flesh was a tad chewy though. The baked clams were delicious. The uni shooter was just okay. The place is packed but seats turn over pretty quickly. An enjoyable time.",4 star rating,Anita L.

You could eat inside the restaurant or do it casual and dine outside at one of their tables. The boyfriend and I ordered a clam chowder bowl and clam linguini pasta. The chowder bowl was just okay and tasted like any other. The clam linguini was pretty good. It had that garlicky, buttered flavor in a cream sauce. Overall, the quality of the food was mediocre at best.",3 star rating,Kat L.

3/25/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I was recommended to come here by someone working at the Santa Barbara Fish Market. It is located at the end of the pier at Stearns Wharf, with a beautiful view and ocean breeze.I got there about an hour prior to closing. There was still a wait, but it was not too bad. There is some indoor seating, with no tables, and outdoor seating heated by lamps. I would suggest getting a seat outdoors for groups and if you plan to order appetizers.My boyfriend and I ordered:+ Uni on scallops and lime: this was the best thing we ordered. Six pieces for $16.95 or so. I heard the Santa Barbara sea urchin was amazing, and it really was!! + Half-dozen oysters: this was fresh and reasonably priced. The oysters were also big, which was a plus.- Crab Cakes: comes with onion rings and cole slaw. This came out cold, and the onion rings were soggy and disappointing. Would skip this next time.+ Local Crab: two pounds of crabby goodness with a side of cole slaw. The crab was definitely fresh, and it was already pre-cracked as well.- Cioppino: my boyfriend ordered this and was disappointed by this. It did not look/taste as fresh as mine.- Bloody Mary: it was not very good, even though it was $7.95. You get what you paid for, I guess?The biggest gripe with our experience was that everything came out at once, so we barely had any room on our bench. The service was also so-so. I think the food would have been a lot better had each dish come out as soon as it was ready. It was overwhelming to get everything at once.I would come back here again and give it another shot. The seafood was good, but the restaurant needs improvement.",3 star rating,Kelley L.

However, they only gave two pieces, which seems too little   given the $15 price.Docked stars for a rude staff member (he seemed to be Latino) who looked at me and started laughing and shouting ""Hai!

There seemed to be a fairly decent wait around 12pm. We ordered the rock crab, box crab, clam linguine, clam chowder, and shrimp cocktail. I really enjoyed the crab. It was very fresh and was reasonable priced. The clams were nice but I thought the pasta was just fair. The chowder was creamy but it had a slightly odd aftertaste. I would probably skip it if I went again. I highly recommend the crab though though. Plus it's great to walk on the pier after the meal.",4 star rating,Mike H.
1/28/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","My girlfriends and I spent the day at Santa Barbara and we arrived by train just in time for lunch. We looked through Yelp to see what was in the area and this restaurant had a lot of varieties on their menu and good reviews so we came straight here.There's no reservations so be sure to write your name as soon as you arrive. We got seated at the patio right next to the ocean and it was just the perfect seating for a nice day out for lunch.We ordered:- Clam Chowder: Loved it! Not too salty and it had enough clams and even bacon in the soup.- Garlic Baked Clams: SO. GOOD. This is def a must-get. The clams are huge and the garlic & cheesiness added such great flavor!- Lobster Roll: At first, I was surprised because it was a cold dish but it tasted fairly good. I personally like the lobster cooked and warm rather than cold like a slaw, but it was still good.- Shrimp Ceviche: Pretty good appetizer dish. Tasted like any other ceviche.- Clam Linguini Pasta: I really really liked this dish, not only because I looove vongole but I really liked how they used cream sauce and it wasn't too creamy. The flavor was just right and I loved how they didn't skimp out on the clams.

10/16/2019,"Garden Grove, CA","Another restaurant where Yelp has let me down like the Dodgers. Came here with the boyfriend last Friday and had the clam chowder, uni, oysters and spiny lobster. Clam chowder was good according to the boyfriend (not a lot of flour used as thickener, no bacon in the soup) and oysters were pretty good. The bones I have to pick with this place is the uni and the spiny lobster. The uni was served as 6 pieces on top of scallops and lime slices with a side of soy sauce. Instead of experiencing a buttery, silky and almost sweet taste from the uni, it tasted like fart. The scallops were also bland and not subtle hints of sweetness. The lime and the soy sauce couldn't save that dish. If the spiny lobster wasn't over grilled so that the meat wasn't tough and rubbery (and partially burnt), I'm sure it would've tasted awesome.For ~$160 spent, I expected more from the restaurant but was extremely disappointed in the food.Service was OK though.",2 star rating,Vanna N.
2/18/2020,"Irvine, CA","Arguably the best seafood in Santa Barbara - serving reliably and dependably good food year after year, right on the pier.

2/17/2020,"San Diego, CA","Food itself was 2 stars and not great. The location netted this place a third star, as it's a really pretty and lively location right on the wharf. Service was fine, neither good nor bad. However, the long wait times combined with high expectations due to high reviews for this place will set you up for disappointment. My wife and I ordered the lobster roll, lobster tacos, and a claim chowder in a bread bowl. The bread bowl contained a super small amount of soup due to a very shallow cut into the bread. I love paying $10 for a piece of sourdough and a soup sampling as much as the next guy, but really? The lobster roll was the best item we ordered. The lobster tasted decent and the buttered bread was pretty good. Are lobster rolls normally cold though? That one is probably on me, I just wasn't expecting it to be cold for some reason. Lastly, the lobster taco. I had such high expectations. The tomato, onion, Cole slaw combo adds nothing to the flavor profile. It just creates a cold and aggressive flavor profile which simultaneously makes the lobster in the tacos taste extremely bland. I'm not even sure how thars possible, lol. The lobster is the only hero at this restaurant, folks. If you wait in line for an hour on a sunny day, then make sure you order straight up lobster and nothing else. Then, and only then, might your expectations be met.",3 star rating,Will R.

5/10/2019,"Los Angeles, CA",Absolutely blown away by this place (and the prices!) I got the clam chowder and steamed muscles and they were both SO good. Especially the muscles that really had time to soak in the garlic and white wine broth. My date got the lobster tacos which I also tried and whatever the dipping sauce is that went with it really made the flavors of the dish pop (the lobster tacos are also gluten free since the tortillas are corn!) My standard for seafood is pretty high and this was absolutely hands down the best seafood I've had since moving to the West Coast.,5 star rating,Kylie T.
1/22/2019,"Mountain View, CA","We were on the hunt to find uni in Santa Barbara and this place hit the spot. We got the 6 pieces of uni served over raw scallops and the uni was super fresh and buttery. The price for the dish was also super reasonable.I hear that the uni is usually limited and they might not serve it everyday so we might have just gotten lucky. We also got there right when it opened on Sunday so that probably helped. I also got a chowder in a bread bowl and it was good but nothing special.If you decide to order at the counter and sit outside at the picnic table, beware - the birds on the pier are super aggressive and WILL take your food if you're not careful.

2/7/2019,"Ventura, CA","Note: average to 3.5 ish stars now I have been here several times now and I believe this will be my 5th time. Not sure where my reviews go or my check-ins go, but oh well. Came on a cloudy and rainy day, but there was still a short wait. Each time I've come, I seem to always order their steamed clams (served in a white wine garlic broth). Aside from that, I've had their cioppino and crab cakes as well. This time, I've also had a bowl of their England style clam chowder and Shrimp and Scallops Pasta (sautéed in butter, garlic, shallots, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes over linguini. The first to come was the bowl of chowder. A sizeable amount and looks 'right'. It was nice to have something warm and thick due to the weather, but taste-wise, the chowder falls short. The chowder, in my opinion, has the right consistency, but lacks in flavor of clam, cream, and salt. The menu says the chowder has bacon in it, but I didn't identify any pieces of bacon. Perhaps it's just the fat from the bacon? There are chunks of clam (not many) and some pieces of vegetables such as potatoes and carrots. What erred me a bit was the two large pieces of bay leaves in the chowder. Bay leaves are debatably edible or not - up to one's perspective. However, I would have preferred to not have the two bay leaves in the chowder and would have thrown  them out instead of serving them in the soup. One can argue they didn't see them, but the bay leaf was the first thing I saw sticking out of the soup when it was served. Next, the pasta and clams came. In the past, the steamed clam came with an additional bowl for shells. I'm not positive if there is a change, but they didn't provide one this time. Luckily, we just used the chowder's bowl instead of putting them on the table. For the 5th time I've had the clams, I'm starting to think the item is worth it only for the amount of clams now. The taste profile has gone downhill that I can't appreciate it as much anymore. The white wine can be a little strong, but that is meant to be balanced by cooking the alcohol and adding tarragon into it. However, I personally think the tarragon is too much and the white wine broth could have been cooked a bit longer to evaporate the dryness out a bit more. As a whole, it has a very strong flavor, which can be very appealing, but the flavor itself wasn't too balanced. In addition, I believe they used to serve two pieces of bread with the clams, but they provide only one now. Lastly, the pasta dish. I knew the sauce is a buttery-garlic sauce, but we both felt the dish was on the dry side as well as lacking sufficient butter and garlic. The garlic and shallots used were whole pieces so the garlic taste does not permeate the entire pasta dish. If the garlic was diced, it might help it some more. Aside from that, I don't think enough white wine and butter were used as the linguini wasn't coated evenly. The biggest flavor came from the sun-dried tomatoes and the shredded cheese. The shrimp and scallops were ""fresh"" and didn't taste bad, but they were completely bland. To me, I didn't think the seafood were great, because they were devoid of the taste of seafood - the scallops were bland and lacking a sweet taste to it, but at least not rubbery like overcooked scallops. The shrimp were mostly bland, but again, not overcooked luckily. Service-wise: hit and miss. Sometimes the server is happy and sometimes they are very gruff. This time, the service was very gruff and everyone that worked that day appeared to not want to be there. I understand and don't mind it too much. This review is still purely based on the food. Overall, I am starting to reconsider whether the place is worth coming back repeatedly. I am willing to try a sandwich/roll item from here. Everyone seems to get that instead of what I get or a Dungeness crab. I wouldn't get a crab, but a lobster or crab roll maybe. Up to each their own and I believe they are worth a try if you haven't been and it's on Stearn's wharf, which isn't a bad stop and visit tourist location.",3 star rating,Alex W.

Great quality seafood! I ordered the lobster tacos which is lobster sauteed with tomatoes, shallots, garlic, and basil served on warm corn tortillas with spanish or white rice. There's a creamy salsa & avocado on the side as well! The ""creamy salsa"" was more of like a ranch with textures. I asked and sadly, they didn't have any tomato salsa :( There wasn't much flavor & the tortillas were really dry :/My mom ordered the cioppino which was pretty good. In a bread bowl, there's crab legs, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels in their homemade Cioppino sauce. It's topped off with some parmesan. Overall, the service was great.

But luckily it was just my bf and I so we did not have to wait long. Since we were to have a second dinner later that night (we're beasts, I know) we decided not to order the whole crab or lobster (which I kind of regret because they looked SO fresh and juicy) but instead got a bunch of appetizers so we could try a little bit of everything. We ended up ordering:*Kumamoto oysters - fresh but pricey.*Santa Barbara uni on top of raw scallop sashimi - fresh, milky, sweet, buttery, DELICIOUS!*Clam chowder - hearty and creamy with big chunks of clams.*Dungeness crab cocktail - big pieces of crab but lacking in that crab flavor.

We also got the lobster pasta, but I think we could have passed on that because they pasta wasn't anything special and the lobster wasn't as fresh and meat-y as they were in the rolls.Overall though, it's a good place for seafood and it's nice when you can get a seat on the pier when it's sunny out.",4 star rating,Sophia Y.

It's definitely a scenic view if there's no one in the seating arrangement in front of you. I ordered the lobster pasta, which is definitely worth the $$$ I paid. It's not subtle whatsoever, but you can taste a slightly overwhelming amount of wine. I actually didn't mind that, since it added a good amount of moisture to the oily texture in the pasta. The bread goes brilliantly well with the dish, especially if it's already soaked up some of the sauce. Please scatter some butter across your bread as well. It's just perfect. Overall, a lovely experience.",4 star rating,Stephen C.

That is how fresh it is. It was still moving!! And then the scallops raw was just decadent. It's so simple and fresh but it was on par with an elaborate fancy restaurant. I can't emphasize enough- SO GOOD. I ordered the crab special which came in 2 and just SO FRESH. Gosh just writing this review makes me crave it so badly. The pricing I would say is right for the quality. I can't say much for the cooked dishes, but I would say definitely come here for the fresh seafood.

4/1/2018,"Austin, TX","Take a walk to the end of the Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara and you can't miss this place - it's the shack right at the end. Due to its location, I can see how it's so popular and why you're likely to wait for a seat. When you walk up to the front, there is a sheet (waitlist) out front where you can jot down your name. If you don't feel like waiting, look off to the side of the building, there is a walk-up counter along with a group of picnic tables off to the side. It turns out you can just order, pick up your food, and seat yourself at the open tables. After waiting for a seat for around 20 minutes, we decided to just walk up to the counter and order some food. We got the seasonal bisque bread bowl, shrimp tacos, and shellfish favorites. Maybe I had high expectations but I wasn't overly impressed. The food was okay but I wasn't jumping up and down over what we got.I personally think this place is hyped up from its location. It is pretty convenient being located right on the popular Stearns Wharf. I wish the order counter on the side would be more advertised so that others don't make the same mistake that we did of waiting for a table for a while without realizing you could just order food and seat yourself if you don't want to deal with waiting!",3 star rating,Sasha G.
6/15/2020,"Wichita, KS","Disappointed.  Long lines, ok food and expensive.  We spent $80 and wasn't even full - we ordered baked clams, lobster roll and a box crab.  Not worth the time and money. Baked clams were not cooked so if you don't eat raw clams, do not get this.  Lobster was not good.  They have the meat pre-made and they just scoop it into a bun.  It's fast but it has no flavor.  Box crab was good but make sure you order something else because it won't fill you up.",2 star rating,Taylor S.
7/3/2019,"San Diego, CA","Everything we had here was amazing and everything comes with a couple onion rings. This place is a total tourist trap but the food is so good it doesn't matter. We went on a Tuesday evening, and it wasn't too busy. You have to put your name on a list, and chose whether you want to be seated inside or outside. We chose to sit inside and were seated in less than 5 minutes. There's also a to go window and there was pretty steady traffic of food leaving through this window.We started with the crab cakes and coconut shrimp. Since we were seated inside at the bar, we got to see most of our food cooked for us. The food came out at the perfect pace. Crab cakes were full of meat and coconut shrimp were good too.For entrees, my wife ordered the lobster roll, and I got the daily special of a 2lb. box crab. The lobster roll was dressed lightly, and there was so much meat, it could have easily been a whole lobster. the bread was buttery but still hearty enough to hold up to the amount of lobster that filled it. It was a BIG lobster roll. Much bigger than any other lobster roll I've gotten for that price ($19.99) and I needed a knife to cut it up to eat. The box crab was recommended over the rock crab, and I'm glad I went with it. It was tender and slightly sweet. Service was spot on and I would have gladly gone back everyday on my mini vacation in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Jet R.

12/15/2020,"Goleta, CA","I really don't have a clue how this place has 4 stars to be honest. The food is pretty atrocious. And just to preface, I don't have COVID, so that's not the reason for the review below, the complete lack of salt and any kind of seasoning has been echoed in many of these reviews and my partner and I both agreed on the lack of flavor. We're local and we came to the conclusion that the only reason this place is still in business is because of tourists who have no idea what they're getting themselves into and see a 4 star yelp rating and believe it to be accurate. We got 2 lobster rolls, the coconut shrimp, and 2 beers; the whopping total was $80. We were both really upset that we spent that much money on this low quality of food. Coconut shrimp: actually not terrible, but it's really not hard to deep fry something and make it taste good. The sauce that the shrimp came with was terrible and had barely any flavor. It actually took away from the stomachable flavor of the shrimp. Lobster rolls: these.... were the worst lobster rolls I've ever had in my life. They only toasted one side of the bun, so the rest of the bread was just that: bread. I'm not saying they didn't toast the inside of the bun, you're not supposed to do that; I'm saying they only toasted one side of the OUTSIDE of the bun. Like.... what? That would be like only toasting the bottom bun of a burger... bizarre method. The lobster tasted like it had been sitting in nasty ass water for far too long, it didn't taste fresh at ALL. It had that really bad fishy taste, you know the one I'm talking about. On top of that, it was the most bland mixture of ingredients I've ever tasted AND it was cold. We actually couldn't tell if it was purposefully cold. The ""side"" of onion rings it comes with was a laughable TWO whole onion rings. And I actually take back what I said earlier; apparently it is possible to deep fry something and have it still taste terrible. There was zero seasoning in the breading, so it had no flavor and even though there were only 2 whole onion rings in my box, I didn't even finish 1. The slaw that it came with was equally unimpressive and had no seasoning either. Way too mayo-y, not enough citrus, and zero salt. If you want good seafood, head over to the harbor, not the wharf. The harbor has some amazing food, especially at Brophy Bro's and their ""fast""-food spin off, On The Alley.",1 star rating,Becca M.
4/19/2019,"Alhambra, CA","When we arrived around 3pm, there was an hour wait so we we're very anticipating how good the seafood here is. The wind was blowing so hard outside and the paper where you are supposed to write your name on keeps on being blown by the wind and I kept on fixing the board in fear that the paper with our names and the other customers name on it will be blown away to the sea! The servers come to check the list every 10 to 15 mins. We were seated on the side. This place doesn't have tables. If you are with a big party with children, I do not recommend this place for it gets  really packed for the place is really small. Food: the oysters were really fresh. Loved the variety on the oyster platter. The clam chowder was jusy okay. You can find the same taste in other restaurants. Also ordered the shrimp scampi, nothing special with the pasta. The uni was just okay. The presentation was nice. But since they placed the uni on top of the lemon, the natural taste of the uni was over powered. If you are from LA like me, there is really not much difference with the seafood here and in this place. Tried oysters and Uni in San diego, it is comparable. If you want the hassle of waiting and being in a packed restaurant, go here. But there are some places that may offer the same freshness and items without the hassle. All in all, I will just eat here if I visit Santa barbara, but heading here just to eat seafood... maybe I'll pass.",3 star rating,Brian Melissa M.
11/22/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","A must stop in SB.  My second time here and here are my recommendations...Clam linguine pasta- a MUST HAVE.  So good.  Best clam linguine I've ever had.  The sauce was so creamy and thicky, and the pasta was so fresh and chewy!  Also the flavor of clams was bursting in every bite.  Uni and scallop over lime- I was so sad they didn't have this at my first visit.  When I actually tried it, I was a little disappointed.  Looks a lot better than it tastes.  The scallop was sweet, the uni was suuuper fresh and buttery.  But together it was just too much IMO.  Oysters- Kumamotos are my favorite and a must get. Clam chowder- good, but after having Splash cafe, I can never compare it to another chowder again.Ceviche- this might be because I'm not a big fan of ceviche.. but I thought it was rather dry and flavorless.",5 star rating,Lilly C.
3/20/2019,"San Francisco, CA","You can't really go wrong with SBSC when you're in the mood to eat some seafood by the ocean. Though they don't take reservations, the seats turn over quickly enough (especially if you're willing to sacrifice sitting outside, as intuitively most parties opt to dine al fresco), and the wait is worth it, for the most part. Everything is reasonably priced, and the views are downright gorgeous.We got a bottle of the Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc, which was beautiful to drink by the waterfront. In terms of food, we opted for the clam chowder, which was AMAZING. It was creamy but not overbearingly so, and I was genuinely taken aback by the lack of potatoes and the abundance of seafood (NYC clam chowder has ruined me) that it was probably my favorite dish of the meal.We also got the uni on raw scallops, which my partner really enjoyed, the shrimp and scallop pasta (pasta was a bit over cooked and bland, scallops were tasteless, but the shrimp alone managed to save the entire dish), and the dungeness crab cakes (extremely fresh).It really is a fantastic place to take in all the grandeur of the ocean while sipping on some wine to pass the day. The only thing was that service was a bit slower than I would've liked, but our server was super personable and we still had a great time.",4 star rating,Dan C.
12/18/2017,"San Diego, CA","First time in Santa Barbara and apparently this place was all the rage. It's right on the pier overlooking the water. You won't miss it - it has a huge line. Surprisingly the indoor seating is actually very limited which is why the waits are so long. I will say, our wait was about 2 hours. This might seem absurdly long, but the food was very delicious and fresh. I know this for a fact because I saw the people in there ripping live crab apart - legs still moving and all. That was mildly disturbing, but I suppose it doesn't get any fresher than that. We ordered the uni and rock crab. Both were so fresh. The uni was definitely comparable to the fresh uni I have in San Diego regularly. It's served with scallops and lime, great combo! But I will say, that was probably the best crab I've ever eaten. The shell came off so easily and the meat was just so soft! I usually hate peeling and cracking crab apart, but I definitely made the effort to clean this one out. The couple next to us had ordered the king crab which also looked delish! They said it was super yummy too. So if you're in the area with 2 hours to kill, put your names down, buy some fudge and ice cream nearby, go explore the pier while walking it off, and then be ready for delicious shellfish!",4 star rating,Joyce C.

Where was the lime or lemon or chilis or cilantro, or cucumber or avocado or seasoning.Lastly the overcooked greasy coconut shrimp with tasteless coleslaw.Sooooooo disappointing since we drove from Encino and waited for 45 min to be seated.

Bread wasn't flavorful and the meat was just so-so.

2/21/2018,"San Ramon, CA","I'm pretty torn about this place. The view is stellar if you sit outside and they have a decent selection of seafood. How the food taste leaves a lot to be desired.I went here with my girlfriend because she was craving lobster. I had every intentions of being a tourist. Being gouged at the prices we were charged wasn't surprising. I still was hoping other reviews were wrong or exaggerating about their bad food. Sadly, the food is not good with some very minor exceptions.We started with ordering the sea urchin which was actually the highlight and my favorite thing about this entire experience. I love uni and they put it on top of a scallop and a slice of lime. The concept and execution is wonderful if you love uni and scallop. Unfortunately, even with uni's distinct taste, the scallop tasted a little ""off."" I'm full on expecting a taste reminiscent of the ocean, but the scallop was fishy to a borderline possibly starting to get spoiled kind of fishy. I'm starting to figure out why it was featured as a special and served on a slice of lime. I would like to experience this dish with fresh ingredients at another restaurant.I also ordered half a dozen Kumimoto oysters which set me back $22. If ""meh"" had a physical form this may very well be it. Vinegar, cocktail sauce, liquid gold could not convince me that this was worth what I paid. It didn't help that when I slurped one of the oysters I got a piece of shell (which is common when you shuck oysters, so no one is really at fault here besides myself for not choosing to eat here) which only continued to snowball how unpleasant this experience was going to be.I ordered 2 Lobster rolls (which was a special) for $19 each. This sandwich was painfully flavorless. The sandwich had a lot of lobster, but it was like eating imitation crab or fish. It looked and even smelled like lobster, but tasted like forgettable bland nothingness. Was I supposed to put hot sauce on it or something? Squeeze lemon on it? Sprinkle pepper? Did they forget to put mayo on it? I doubt anything could have saved how it tasted. Also the roll they used wasn't buttered and was heavy/thick enough for me to dislike it. The slaw was memorable because it had raisins in it, but that may not be for everyone. Not surprising, the slaw was in an ocean of mayo which I probably should have shoved into my lobster roll to make it taste like something. It comes with 2 crispy onion rings which I give a thumbs up.Lastly my girlfriend ordered the Cioppino. Presentation is nice, it comes out hot, I think it'd be better as a bowl of soup/stew than in a bread bowl. The bread soaks up all the flavor which is bad if you don't plan on slamming an entire bread bowl. It had a couple pieces of mussels, scallops, and shrimps and half a tiny crab. Flavor of this was good, but not phenomenal. Again, I'd prefer it if it were a seafood soup/stew. It felt like something you would order at an Italian restaurant, not some dive-beach front crab shack.I had an ice cold Pacifico which set me back $6. They had a Groupon deal that I missed out on, and even using that I have my doubts that it would even still be worth my time or my taste buds. The employee working at the bar was friendly and I should have tipped him more, but I was so turned off by this entire oral beating that I was ready to uppercut myself in the skull so I could forget this entire experience. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara Shellfish Company left a fishy taste in my mouth that I can't seem to shake. SEE WHAT I DID THERE?",1 star rating,Corey P.
12/21/2018,"Alhambra, CA","This place is a good bang for your buck for seafood.  Its located toward the end of Stearns Wharf where parking is 90 min free.  The inside is small with counter seating only. There are also a few bench seats outside but it was cold and dark so they didnt seem like a great place to sit at the time. It's a little dingy inside from being so close to the water, and that's why this place is so great. It's a no frills type of seafood shack on the water. You can see all the tanks where they get their fresh seafood. You can see all the chefs doing their thing. The prices are maybe the best part. I ordered the cioppino because you rarely see a cioppino for under $20...usually they will be double the price. The dish was delicious and I will definitely come back again to get my seafood fix.",5 star rating,Gary W.
12/4/2018,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA","This was a great clam chowder and an awesome view for a memorable lunch on Stearns Wharf. If you look through yelp on the wharf this is by far the best rated place on the pier, located at the end of the pier around cute little shops. The wait wasn't that long, about 20-30 minutes with 3-4 couples waiting.  I wish I would have seen the takeout window before waiting because there is ample picnic tables right outside the restaurant that also had a great view with no wait. This place is small so they're not going to turn over tables that fast. It's cool that you don't have to walk the wharf and can drive right up; but the walk was quick from the Wayfarer Hotel/funk zone. If it's windy I recommend eating inside. I'm not going to deduct a star for pier weather but it was crazy with peoples money flying away and the table sauces tipping over.

The pier itself is very people friendly you can drive your car, ride a bike, walk. This time is the first time I drove-park my car on this historical Stearns Wharf. The restaurant is located on the historic wharf towards the end of the beautiful Pier on beautiful Santa Barbara. At the main entrance door we're asked to add our name to be seated indoor however, our timing was perfect as we didn't have to wait at all a staff member offered us a seating by the bar. This small restaurant has it own personality small with good food paired with some amazing ocean views, topped with great background music is a soft-low Pink Floyd music of yesteryear and other soft rock music while dinning. As expected it's packed with tourist and as well as locals.  Once inside is a small-cozy restaurant, were given a menu with the specials and our waiter was really helpful and he suggested the a cup of Shrimp brisk, as well as a Combo Platter which consist of Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Scallops, Onion rings, and Fried Oysters,  with coleslaw. This was the Everything Fried Combo, which we enjoyed.  Everything was really delicious It was well paired with a glass of Chardonnay and Proseco Sparking Wine served in a flute champagne glass oh-la-la! very fancy drink. Both wines are some Central California vineyards.If you are looking for a casual-wonderful experience with great music, great service, fantastic food and awesome ocean views.

10/19/2017,"Tucson, AZ","Great view and food was okay too. We got seated right away and the waiter was very nice. I think the deal was he was so busy pushing drinks that he didn't really hear my order. I asked about the ceviche and he explained it was too large scoops. My partner had crabcakes. However, when the food came out my two large scoops were actually small and situated on top of a large scoop of shredded cabbage. My partner gave me her crabcakes because she was afraid they were combined with fish as a filler and she's allergic to fish. I thought they tasted OK, but nothing extraordinary. My ceviche was very tasty, but lacking in salt and spice. Still it was very fresh and done tastefully.I had also ordered a salad as explained above, but it never came as the waiter was pushing drinks and all they had to offer was beer and wine. What's funny is we enjoyed being outside and didn't really mind so much as the weather was pretty nice and the view was too. Next time we just know to try something a little more substantial.

And I waited and waited for an hour to try it and was so concerned they were gonna run out. Finally, I got my uni and I was not disappointed. It was so good and so fresh. My first time trying uni and I'm glad I had it here. We also ordered lobster tacos, ceviche, and oysters on the half shell, and everything was just delicious and really fresh. Now, the wait time really ruined it for me at first. There's no reservation and you must sign in on the chart since it's first come first serve. I understand that this is a restaurant on the pier and it's small, but because of that, it can really turn people off having to wait that long. People were getting impatient and argued about the wait. Some even left and crossed their names off the list. I went on a Sunday evening it was so packed and took forever I wanted to leave. But once I sat down at the bar and had my fresh seafood and a glass of wine, my frustration went away and I was so happy. The waiter at the bar was very nice and chatty. He forgot about our ceviche but waived it for us and apologized for it. And price is very reasonable here. I can't wait to go back here to eat other dishes they offer like crab and seafood cioppino.

9/22/2019,"Lake Elsinore, CA","The place is OK. Nothing to rant and rave about. The pros - For seafood, the prices are fair and they have a great array of choices on the menu. The cons - No room in restaurant and there's only four tables outside. The service is lackluster; they weren't rude, but they gave me the minimum. Lastly, while their main course selection gives you a lot choices, they should add a side or two and maybe include bread service (baguettes).",3 star rating,Kevin J. S.

12/28/2019,"San Jose, CA","Wait times are probably the worst thing about the dining experience here. I know it can easily go above 1 hr, but luckily we only had to wait 30 min tonight. Even though we put our name at the bottom of the second page, a lot of people left before us. Got to order: calamari, cup of clam chowder, Bloody Mary, lobster pasta, and rock crab. I've never really had rock crab before so was very interested. Apparently they're local to SB. Turns out I like rock crab the least out of all the crabs I've eaten. They're saltier & less firm than dungeness & Alaskan king.  Clam chowder was good. Sharing a small cup between two people was a test of love and patience. I liked the calamari, but husband did not. He prefers crispier calamari but I'm fine so long as quality of the squid is fresh, which it was. Lobster pasta was good too, but keep in mind it's only lobster claw meat. I'd come back here again... if wait times are manageable. I really wanted the uni tonight but they sold out.",4 star rating,Mimi N.

The menu very much features fresh local catches such as uni (sea urchin) on a bed of fresh scallop and lime, which we thoroughly enjoyed. They even brought the live uni shell with black spikes to entertain, and man, I've never seen a live uni before... The rock crab was also a delight. We had to wait for a good half an hour before getting seated at the bar, and that's on a random Friday afternoon. I would plan for ample time to stand in line and enjoy the board walk while waiting. They have free valet parking.",4 star rating,Yingna L.
7/3/2017,"Anaheim, CA","I didn't expect my crab to be cleaned of all the insides- that would have changed my entire perspective on dining here. I've gone to Redondo pier and aside from cracking the shell open, they give you the rest of the crab in it's entirety (dungeness).We got a fried sampler appetizer and that was pretty good- don't get too much fried stuff as most things come with their onion rings.Just a place to check out if you're hanging near the pier but I wouldn't highly recommend it - maybe stick with their lobster roll, seemed like everyone was ordering that.P.S. there is a to go window on the side of the restaurant if you prefer eating at a designated outdoor seating area that is first come, first serve.",3 star rating,James L.

7/14/2019,"Simi Valley, CA","$138.00 later for 3, left hungry. Unless you want to fill up on the bread bowl that the clam flavored chowder is served in. Box Crab - ordered 3 lbs - looked like we got 2 lbs worth! Crab was sweet but not worth 18.00 a pound! 2 onion rings as a side? Felt cheated!! Sea Urchin on scallops on sliced limes- Portions not the same in pictures depicted on Yelp! Imagine the samples at Costco - that's what these are - samples not appetizers! Abalone on rice - Again, don't expect to get full!! These are appetizers!! Clam Chowder in bread bowl?? More like clam flavored chowder!! They threw in about 3 teenie ones for good measure! The seating inside is very ""intimate"" meaning you will rub shoulders with others. Outside seating means you will be getting two for the price of one - eating and getting a sun tan at the same time. Outside ordering, which we opted after waiting 40 minutes and gave up, is also very frustrating. There is just one window so if you wanted extra sauces, you would either wait in line again, or elbow your way to the front, praying you don't piss the person in line.

We sat outside and it was a bit chilly, but bright and with a view of the ocean, so wasn't all too bad.We ordered the 3lb rock crab that came with onion rings, the clam chowder bread bowl soup, and the special of raw scallop topped with fresh uni - SO GOOD. Came out to around $60 which isn't the cheapest meal, but the $20 uni/scallop plate was definitely super worth it. I don't usually like crab, but really enjoyed the rock crab. It was juicy and delicious with the butter.Would definitely recommend this spot! If you don't want to wait, there are a bunch of picnic tables outside. Just go to the order window to do a pick up order and eat on one of those tables.PARKING: on the pier, free 90 minutes. There aren't too many spots, but you may get lucky.

The lobster pasta was bland, boring and a small portion for 20$, A shrimp taco had a sad 3 pieces of shrimp.  The crab sandwich was a cold sandwich, which I'm not sure if it was to be cold.

The crab was large, got the 3 lb rock crab special, which came with LARGE awesome onion rings! They also gave us lemon, hot sauce, and wet naps. The lobster bisque was unbelievable in a bread bowl. So so good. And the shrimp scampi came up as shrimp with rice rather than pasta as I imagined it. The kids loved it tho so that was good.The menu was quite long and there were so many options.

9/13/2017,"San Marcos, TX","Ever since I had what could possibly be the best fish taco I sampled along the beach during our first visit to Santa Barbara some 9 or so years ago, I made it a point to try seafood during this visit.In checking Yelp, the Santa Barbara Shellfish Co. seems to be up there on the list...so we planned to have dinner right before sunset, right around 6:30 PM. Located at the end of Stearns Wharf, its location couldn't be any better. There was a  short waiting list when we got there...we signed up for inside seating and within a few minutes were sitting along the bar. The place is quite cozy (i.e. small) with some outdoor seating but diners have an option to order by a walk-up window and dine on one of the few picnic tables on the boardwalk by the restaurant.We sat next to a couple who were regulars, informing us what shellfish were caught locally and what had to be shipped. I initially considered a lobster roll but was told local lobsters weren't available quite yet. So, thinking about a scrumptious fried fresh seafood offering we tried in Cinque Terre, I opted for the fried seafood combo with calamari, oysters, shrimp and scallops. My wife tried their coconut shrimp.My dish was just OK. The calamari seemed overdone while the oysters didn't seem like it was a good candidate to be breaded then deep fried, with a mushy interior that I had to power through. The scallops were fresh as were the shrimp but some of the breading still seemed doughy. My wife noted how big the shrimp were and how fresh the coconuts were but thought her coconut shrimp was just OK.All in all, a bit disappointing, with hype not quite matching our experience. Good thing they have the ideal location or the rating could've been lower.Dinner for two with fountain drinks came out to less than $40 with tip.",3 star rating,Mel M.

Lobster roll did not have butter like the ones I've had at other places, but this actually makes it much better because you don't get the overwhelming and heavy butter taste. Crab sandwich was good too and has a lot of crab meat. The clam pasta was good too but got a bit too heavy towards the end. Overall, enjoyable meal.",4 star rating,Morison W.

If you haven't had box crab, you've got to try it: sweetest, juiciest crab you'll ever have. I have to say, it rivals my favorite, the Alaskan king crab.

2/19/2017,"Alexandria, VA","I'm not going to lie... I've passed by this restaurant more times than I can count because I'm usually out on the pier playing Pokémon (guilty!!!). We got seated immediately, and ordered 3 clam chowders in bread bowls. The chowder is definitely tasty- a nice peppery taste, large clams, and a good mix of veggies and potatoes. I was also given some butter so I could devour some of the sourdough bread. The one thing that I'm really critical about is the temperature and the grittiness of the chowder- seafood is bound to have some grains of sand and stuff. There has only been one restaurant where I haven't experienced that weird grittiness. Unfortunately, this wasn't the place. The clam chowder wasn't a real generous portion either. The temperature was also not hot at all. I'm weird and love my food piping hot, but this was lukewarm at best. Flavors are all there though.The crab cakes are excellent- a generous portion of crab, and a nice mild kick. Add a bit of lemon, and you're set! I really enjoyed it. I wish I had more, and I really don't think 2 onion rings are enough.It's a touristy spot, and I would recommend it if you're visiting Santa Barbara, or just need a break from playing Pokémon ;)",4 star rating,Jennie K.

The shrimps ceviche,  dungeness crab cocktail, and oysters on the half shell were all pretty average and I probably wouldn't go there just to order those again. The rock crab was delicious, the cioppino flavor was very good, lobster tacos were wonderful, and the clam linguini was fantastic.

(Shellfish joke, anyone?)- Clam chowder - good but had lots of sand in it :(- Lobster pasta - It's kinda lopped onto a small oval plate, and the lobster was overcooked. The wine was so raw in it (not cooked out) though that it was unappealing to eat.- Coconut shrimp with coleslaw and onion rings- If these coconut shrimp were tanning, they fell asleep drunk in the sun and needed some aloe vera after. They were almost burned, which I get is easier because of all of the sugar.- Uni shooter - Tiny little sliver of uni (like 1/4 a piece...), quail egg, chive and seasoning. Tasty, but a little misleading to call it an uni shooter! Killer location at the end of the pier, but it wouldn't be at the top of my recommendation list.",3 star rating,Jocelyn C.

Nice smell fish and nice little fish in a tank staring at you. There's other things in there too. I don't know what they are but they look weird. Maybe next time I'll try the weird fishes. But when I did settle for was the nice tacos. It's not too classy of a place, but it's a good place to stop by and give their food a try. It's very small inside. Actually it's very tiny inside.

4/18/2017,"San Francisco, CA","Word of advice: be prepared to wait. A while. The line here is no joke. Came here with a group of 3 and we waited over a hour to get a table. If you're larger than a party of 4-5, I'd suggest going elsewhere. This also isn't the most kid friendly spot either. Not bc they wouldn't be friendly, but bc they're not set up for it. Inside of their ""restaurant""...I quote that bc it's more of a tinier shack situation...they only have bar and window seating. No tables. The tables are outside, and there are only three of them (these outdoor tables are hot commodities!!). IF you do come with the kiddies or fam, these are the best seats for sharing obviously. The fresh uni sashimi was honestly worth the wait. IT WAS SOOO GOOD. If you get one thing (which you won't), make sure to get this. The friends never had uni before, so I knew this was the best place for them to try it for the first time. Super, super fresh. We also got the rockshell crab? I'm honestly not the biggest fan of these types of crab bc they lack the meat you can get from Dungeness crabs. We added onion rings and clam chowder at the end for good measure. In the end, I couldn't eat the clam chowder bc it had bacon in it, and I'm not the biggest fan of onion rings, but they were good. Service was pretty spotty in terms of getting their attention (the staff to customer ratio just isn't great!), but when we did have their attention, they were great. I can appreciate the effort.

4/21/2019,"Sunnyvale, CA","Decent meal in a nice location and the end of the pier.  We only had one night to spend in Santa Barbara and wanted a waterfront experience for both our hotel and our meal.  We made a pleasant early evening walk along the beach and down the wharf where we found this place.  Because there is limited indoor seating, we had to wait about 25 minutes to get a table, and then found ourselves crammed onto barstools at the counter.  Though it made for difficult conversation, it was fun to watch our food being prepared right in front of us.Our meal consisted of:Side salad and garden salad - both very typical, nothing special or distinctive about these.Bowl of clam chowder - seriously, this is the best chowder I've had in a very long time.  Buttery broth full of large chunks of tender clams.  I couldn't detect any artificial thickeners that I suspect are added to other clam chowders.  I could have eaten a whole pot of this stuff.Fried combo - we ordered the four item combo, which included shrimp, calamari, oysters, and scallops.  This was just meh - kind of heavy on the breading which results in a greasy texture.  Coleslaw was kind of bland, but the onion rings were good.Shrimp and scallops linguine - the seafood ingredients were perfectly cooked.  This was a little surprising, because I watched the dish being cooked and I was convinced that they left it over high heat for entirely too long, but I was mistaken.  However, there was way, way, way too much sun dried tomatoes in this dish, and it really overpowered what should have been a fine dish.Clam linguine - this was fine, but probably would be better in a wine-based sauce instead of the cream sauce, which made what should have been a light dish somewhat heavy.Service was efficient and the atmosphere is bustling and noisy, which was fine with us.  Overall, we were mostly satisfied with this experience but will choose our dishes more carefully when we return (though I'm definitely getting two bowls of that chowder next time).",3 star rating,Lee L.

It was light, not too ""fishy"" flavor, and not too salty. It had plenty of seafood and was chunky. It just had an excellent flavor and I could easily go back again for some of that alone.Overall, great place to come.

4/26/2020,"Glendale, CA","Went yesterday this was the only place open for food. I ordered the pasta coconut shrimp and the crab cakes. The food was disgusting, the fries were soggy. The pasta had no flavor and was over cooked. We paid 75 plus tip. My kid said the crab cakes were good. I get that this is a touristy place  but man that's expensive for shitty food. The staff was nice but looked so tired. They were almost sold out of everything as it was already 7pm..dont mind paying for good food.but a filetofish would have been better than what we ate.",1 star rating,jessi m.
3/27/2018,"Seattle, WA","Went there based on Yelp reviews which claimed that they have the best clam chowder. The place was full, we waited at the door for like 10 minutes (no server came to us). In those 10 minutes, we saw several crabs and lobsters being taken out of dirty aquarium like structure by hand. A few of them were weighed and thrown back in. We just coudn't bear the sight and the smell. I wonder if this place passed any sanitation tests. Their clam chowder might be the best but I think you'll enjoy it only if you order to-go over the phone! I know that freshness-wise this is probably the best place since they probably take out fish/crab/lobster when you order, but its pretty disturbing to watch!",1 star rating,Rupal R.

6/1/2018,"Costa Mesa, CA","I went here from the hype it got from the app...let's just say it didn't live up to it for me. I waited around 35 minutes to be seated outside since it's such a beautiful area. An employee told me it was going to be a 30 minute wait and I could eat right away if seated inside, but I chose to wait and walk around instead. I came back 20 minutes later to see that I was bumped off the list. Great first impression. I waited another 10 minutes to be seated. I'll be honest that I was pretty hangry before my meal so I'm sure that's a major factor into all this. I ordered the lobster tacos and although they were good that's about it. The Spanish rice was basic. For around $18 I would have rather spent it elsewhere. I ended up getting Mexican food from a street vendor. Best $3 spent while on this trip.",3 star rating,Jon P.

8/26/2019,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is one of our favorite local spots.  We are always excited to see what they will have on the menu.  This time it was fresh Uni with Sea Scallops served over limes.  So delicious it practically melted in our mouths.  We followed this course with one of my  SBSC favorites - Cioppino. It never disappoints.  Thank you to the courteous servers and their amazing kitchen staff.,5 star rating,Suzi L.
9/25/2016,"West Covina, CA","I was in Santa Barbara for a 2 days and I came here twice for lunch. I sat inside once and outside the 2nd time. Both times I was impressed from the view I got. Outside seating you're next to the dock and you get an ocean view. Now imagine that during sunset bc you'll be facing it. Inside I sat at the counter (highly recommended when inside) you get a good view of all the cooking action. Service was quite good very attentive from the two servers I had.  Beverage they do have a good variety on tap, but if you're in SB you mine as well have Firestone. Bloody Mary mix, but they do it with soju. Not a fan of soju, but by all means. FoodAlbalone: fried with tomato rice. Kind of disappointed with the way they prepared the albalone. Should be slow cooked or eaten raw that's my preference. The taste and texture was gone with the fried. Local rock crab nicely steam and sweet easy to crack Uni: SB you have to have uni. Served on top of a raw scallop. Delicious, you really can't do Uni wrong. Local spider crab: all I have to say is he prepared to work they do top it with onion rings and served with soup and salad soup is clam chowder or shrimp bisque. Warning 4lbs is more than enough for 2!!Clams: excellent butter garlic freshness rolled into one. Raw oyster: expected they have  kusshi and blue points taste is expected with raw oysters As you can tell it's all about shellfish here Happy cracking",4 star rating,Chester C.
9/23/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","I wish I found this places earlier. I'm kinda embarrassed that I've been to SB 3 times prior to this and haven't been here until now!I loved seafood and this place really delivers! Make sure to order the local seafoods: uni, rock crab, spider crab. They were out of uni when we came on Wednesday but we came back the next day and got the uni! It is on the pricey side but wouldn't say it's out of the ordinary compare to other fresh seafood restaurants. The spider crab is 9.95/lb and usually between 5-10 lbs. I actually like the rock crab more because it taste sweeter but both were really fresh. I was really looking forward to the uni/scallops/lime dish but I wasn't very impressed. Makes sure to eat them separately which was way better! The uni is so fresh! The abalone wasn't my favorite either because it was cooked in tomatoes and rice. I wish they offer abalone sashimi or just steamed!Overall the local ingredients (uni, crabs, clams) were super fresh! Definitely will come back!",5 star rating,Yun C.
8/20/2020,"Buena Park, CA","Overpriced food. All of the food was cold. The bread was out of the bag, unseasoned, not toasted, and plain. Coleslaw tasted like cabbage soup, soggy, mayo heavy, cabbage soup. The lobster is combined with minimal seasoning, which would be okay if it didn't taste frozen & had a rubber-y texture. Crab sandwich tasted chewy and stale. Cashier was rude. We based our visit off of these same Yelp reviews and were sorely disappointed. I would never come here again nor recommend to anyone.",1 star rating,Jonathan L.

3/26/2018,"Fresno, CA","I read through tons of yelp reviews before picking a place for dinner. It's very hard to choose a place to eat come on now! Eating by the water always makes food taste better but it sometimes also means they don't have to try as hard to make the food good imo.You can park on the pier first 90 minutes free then 2.50 an hour after that. There was a bit of a wait and afterwards i realized why, it's super super small with all bar seating inside and 4-5 tables outside for parties of 4. our server was very good, quick and explained things well. We ordered caesar salad and clam chowder soup to start. the soup was really good and the salad was decent but not amazing by any means. for the main course we had crab and crab sandwiches. the crab was meaty but not the best. the sandwiches i hate to say i make better with canned crab at home. the meat itself was good but the mix was dry and not very good at all. the bun didn't taste buttered. the onion rings that came with it were plain, they taste like the ones i make lol a recipe i have not perfected and wouldn't serve non family. to note i like seasoned and salted food and so if you prefer more bland food this may be a perfect option for you.",3 star rating,Melissa C.
8/31/2020,"Anaheim, CA","Great location on the pier. Cioppino was not what you would expect. Because of Covid everything is to go. You would think by the last day of August they could get bowls to go instead of dumping the cioppino in tin foil and placing a piece of bread underneath. By the time we got back to the hotel the cioppino had leaked everywhere. What was left was 4 empty mussel shells a little sauce and a crab claw. They forgot the order of fries, which were paid for and the crab sandwich was average.",2 star rating,Evie T.
5/18/2018,"Ogden, UT",This is the seafood restaurant to go to when you visit the Santa Barbara pier.  This service is excellent and very nice waiters hopping all over the place to make sure you have a good experience. The entire back wall is full of tanks of crab. The cioppino is a must-have tons of fresh fish served in a bread bowl.  I sat at the bar and it was really fun to watch them cook my dinner.

9/12/2016,"San Mateo, CA","This place was great. Too bad everyone else realized that too lol.Get the rock crab and uni. So good. Also their onion rings, pasta with clams and shrimp, ceviche, fish tacos and everything else on the menu.Inside seating is just bar seating that goes around the place. It's small and difficult if you have a party larger than two and you want to share meals.Outside seating has four four top tables that face the water. Obviously these are the prime spots so you'll definitely be waiting awhile if this is where you wanna sit.They don't take reservations so just add your name to the list and wait, or get in line for take out, which will still take you 30-45 but they have some picnic benches to eat at.",5 star rating,Mandi W.
1/19/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","WORTH THE WAIT:There will ALWAYS be a line as they do not take reservations. But trust me, wait it out and you won't regret it. Stearns Wharf is one of my favorite places in sb and shellfish co is it's highlight!Take a walk around the wharf while you wait, but stay close enough so you can hear when the waiter calls your name for the table! They move on fast if you are not there to take the table right away. Clam chowder, one word: delectable. I get it every time, and have never been disappointed. From there i typically move to oysters (I'm a huge oyster critic and the ones at shellfish co are always fresh!) Shrimp cocktail is hard to mess up, so always a safe bet for picky eaters.  Would definitely recommend the San ysidro version of the classic shrimp cocktail as it comes with avocado and greens. The cioppino is fantastic! Not a big fan of clams so I usually get without. Who can deny hot cioppino in a bread bowl?! MP for the Alaskan king crab varies but usually somewhere around $27 if I remember correctly.

3/28/2018,"Queens, NY","My friend and I were visiting Santa Barbara and decided to check out the wharf.  We saw that Santa Barbara Shellfish Company had pretty good reviews so we decided to check it out, and they seafood was super fresh.You write your name down on a list and wait for them to call you.  We came on a Thursday around lunch time and waited about 20 minutes.  They seated us at the counter, which was really cool as you could see everything getting prepared.  No one took care of us when we first sat down so we didn't realize they had a whole menu.  All we saw were the specials that were written on the board.  After we looked around did we realize they had printed menus and got up to get one ourselves.They had some really great options for seafood, but we decided on the following:Uni and Scallop Special -- The dish was good but was slightly disappointed by the uni.  Considering the uni was from there, I expected it to be better.  You could tell that the uni was super fresh though since they included half the shell in the presentation and the needles (is that what you call them?) were still moving when we got it.Cioppino -- So yummy.  They put a bunch of different seafood into the sourdough bread.  We even got an entire crab claw.  The bread soaks up the liquid which was delicious.  Side of Onion Rings -- If you looked at all the specials, they always gave a side of onion rings.  We figured there had to be something special about them so we decided to order a side.  These were some of the best onion rings I've ever had.  The outside was nice and crunchy and didn't fall off the onion.  There was just the right amount of breading where you could actually taste the onion which was the perfect sweetness for an onion.",4 star rating,Joanna C.

2/17/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","This is my favorite place to eat, pretty much any where. The prices are great for super fresh, crazy delicious shellfish. Every time I come to Santa Barbara I eat here with my husband. And sometimes I make excuses to go up just so we can have it. We get a 2lb Dungeness crab, kumamoto oysters, clam chowder, and if we're super hungry the shrimp cocktail and a lobster roll. All *ridiculously* delicious. The crab is so perfectly steamed and flavorful you don't even need to dip in anything if you don't want. The service is really good too. The waits are long because it's such a tiny place and crab takes time to crack and eat. But they get you served so fast and keep everything moving like a well oiled machine. Inside seating is all stools at a bar where you can watch the chefs prepare so many delicious things or along the window. There are about 5 tables along the outside that are good for groups of 4-5. They also have a window you can order from, and you can even get alcohol served through there. I'm not sure if it's the same whole menu but it seems like it is. Taking the Surfliner from Union Station, wine tasting around SB and then ending with shellfish at this restaurant, to hop on the Surfliner back home is a perfect day trip.",5 star rating,Diane P.
7/18/2020,"Orange County, CA","It's definitely a tourist trap but the food was good. The fried oysters are on point and the lobster roll was good with plenty of meat. Oysters on a half shell were a bit overpriced but they were fresh and tasty. The clam chowder was good but the bread wasn't anything special. It was dry and didn't seem fresh. Steamed clams were good as well but again, over priced. Definitely ""oh the pier"" prices.",4 star rating,J P.
7/8/2018,"San Jose, CA","Waited for our plate for 20 minutes, worse than sit-down dinner.  Express window is not so express. Also, they make their special items so special, yet not so special. We ordered rock crab special for $29.00 and shrimp cocktails, the crab supposedly 3lbs. It looks like 1lbs to me, the shrimps aren't big as what would you get in a restaurant.I guess it's the experience of eating outside with a bunch of strangers looking at you eating shellfish.  No wonder when I lived here, l only tried it once.",2 star rating,Jojo H.

I wish I took a picture before asking the waitress to take it away. The lobster pasta was too sour and under seasoned. The steamed clams were just bland.  We were still hungry after spending over $50 there. I couldn't believe our bad luck tonight.",1 star rating,Crystal X.
1/9/2019,"Chino, CA","This place is located at the very end of the pier with free 90 minute parking which is awesome. The views and everything were great. We added our name to the wait list and hoped for outdoor seating but ended up seated at the bar. I ordered the famous lobster roll for $20 and my boyfriend got the lobster tacos for about the same price. I didn't try any of his tacos but he raves them to be delicious, flavorful and from the looks of it, very generous in lobster (or the right amount for what we paid for). For me the lobster roll was good and perhaps one of the best in quality because it was very meaty and fresh but I learned that day I am not a bread and seafood kind of person. I could not taste and savor the flavor of the lobster because it was hidden behind the bread, red onions, and lettuce. That is what happens when you order a roll so I cannot blame them for my personal preferences. If I was to rate this in terms of other lobster rolls in the world, I would agree it was delicious and generous on the lobster. Another plus is that they use paper straws for their drinks which is cool and you can see them prepare and cook everything with the open kitchen set up. Overall I would need a second visit for a five star experience. One that would have us seated outside on the beautiful pier and another try at something else on the menu that suits my taste. Worth the visit and price to try!",4 star rating,Stephanie H.

Lots of live shellfish, very reasonable prices, and just a great vibe and atmosphere.Expect a wait, but as long as you're not concerned about how shellfish goes from being alive to on your plate, that time will pass quickly as you watch the master butcher win time and time again against whatever poor foe is next on the ticket. The food is very lightly seasoned -- only simple stuff like salt, oil, or butter, but with seafood this fresh and at the prices they charge, it won't make a difference to your taste buds. For two, we did the live uni/scallops, clam chowder, rock crab, and coconut shrimp. Filled us to our bellies, and we had so much shellfish I might develop an allergy. Add to it that the staff is super friendly and very into it. Drop by, have fun, and have some amazingly fresh seafood. Will go again (tomorrow morning, in fact)!",5 star rating,Robert C.

However, if you're on the go, there's also a side window to order your food to-go. We ordered the steam clams served in a white wine broth. Those were delicious and satisfying. We also ordered the fried seafood which is composed of fried oysters, scallops, shrimp, and calamari accompanied with onion rings and coleslaw. What disappointed me the most was the clam chowder served in the bread bowl. The clam chowder itself was creamy and epitomizes comfort food on a cold day. It was slightly lacking in clams though. Definitely did not like the bread bowl that you can definitely tell was a bit old and stale. So if you really want to try the clam chowder, just get it in a bowl or cup, the bread is not worth to get extra.",3 star rating,Joyce D.

6/9/2018,"Honolulu, HI","This place gets busy, it is a tourist destination as it is on the wharf (I also went during Memorial Day weekend so go figure). This was the first time that my partner and I ate here and we did not where to go and what to do. We were like standing inside until we asked a server how we order and he told us that there was a window on the side of the building. If you want to eat inside, you might have to wait for a while but if you want to sit outside, there are benches on both sides of the restaurants. Depending on how busy it is, you might have to share with other people which is great and fine! We ordered a cioppino and I imagined that it was going to be a small serving but when we got it, it was huge! It fed me and my partner. We meant to just get a snack because we were going to go to the public market but I ended up getting really full. I did not try anything else so I can't vouch for anything else but this cioppino was AMAZING!As for parking, you can park on the wharf which I was amazed at because most wharfs or even piers that I have been to are usually only for pedestrian traffic. And parking is free for first 90 minutes (that's what I remember). Don't try to find parking at the very end, look for parking as you driving by because my partner and I were able to find parking easily but we saw a lot of people at the end trying to park at the very last parking lot.",5 star rating,Romyn S.

I'm obsessed with all of the food that they have. The cioppino is by far my favorite thing they have on the menu. It comes inside of a bread bowl with fresh crab legs sticking out from inside of it.

There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter.

5/17/2016,"Downtown, San Jose, CA","Don't miss out on Santa Barbara Shellfish Company just because it's at the very end of the pier! I'm so so so happy that my friend introduced me to this restaurant because they have the best seafood in the world!!!! (By the way, parking is free after certain hours... I don't remember the exact times).First off, this restaurant has a gorgeous view! If you choose to sit outside, you're sitting on the pier, by the water. It's so romantic, especially when the sun is setting. Their benches are very sticky though. It does get a bit chilly, so don't forget to bring a jacket! Also, the service is great! Just because we were sitting outside, it didn't mean that we got ignored because the waiter kept coming out to check on us.I am so bummed that the uni was sold out on the day I came (I think that just means that I need to come back)! However, I was able to order everything else. As an appetizer, my friend and I shared raw oysters. We got a variety of 4 different types, but I forgot all their names and just ate them all way too quick. They were the best raw oysters I've ever had in my life. For my entree, I ordered half a lobster, which came with 2 (REALLY GOOD) onion rings (come to think of it, I should of ordered more on the side), butter dipping sauce, and a cup of soup. Of course I chose clam chowder and it didn't disappoint, especially since I usually don't like clam chowder. The lobster was amazing, but there wasn't that much meat on it. My friend ordered the abalone with tomato-basil rice and it was soooo delicious! I feel like nothing can go wrong at Santa Barbara Shellfish Company. Give them a try if you're around the area. (Or if you're close enough to take a small trip to SB). It's totally worth it.",5 star rating,Chanel H.
1/21/2019,"San Jose, CA","I came here the past weekend on Saturday on MLK weekend. This was my second lunch (lol), so we did not order a lot. The waitlist was long when I came (around 1:30), but we were seated within minutes because our seating preference was outside. We ordered the uni plate ($21.50), clam chowder bowl, fried oysters, and oyster Rockefeller. The uni was meh to me. It lacked the oceany sweet taste it usually has. The lime made it taste bitter and the dark soy sauce tasting sauce it came with did not compliment it at all. For 21.50, you only get half an uni and six scallops. To me, the pieces were kind of small and overall not that worth it, but presentation looks good! Their clam chowder was eh as well too. It had nice flavor and wasn't too thick, but it was bland and needed more salt. I also wish it came with bread. The oyster rockefellers were good, the flavor was nice. The real star in our meal were the fried oysters. I was presently surprised by how big they were! They were super fat and still had the nice oceany oyster flavor in them! They were fried a bit too much, but they were lovely. For the price, it was the most worth it item that we got. Came with 6 and was around $14 I believe. Overall, my experience here wasn't bad and I would come back to try their pastas because they seem like a good deal and good. Till next time.",4 star rating,amy k.

I loved that there was a lot of seafood in the clam chowder and the crab in the sandwich had a strong taste.What really looked amazing was the amount of seafood piled into tomato combo seafood soup. I think eating here is worth it for the atmosphere and the food is not bad, of course they need to charge a premium since you're right on the pier. But! Not only do you get piping hot seafood, you get to catch a ton of Pokemon, there are 5-lures just out on this pier, amazing!!",3 star rating,Kristen Q.

3/5/2018,"Chino Hills, CA","Fresh and delicious seafood at the pier, can't leave Santa Barbara without having a meal here. The establishment is small, with about 4 tables outside and a few inside with the beach view. And of course there are counter seats facing the open kitchen (best view in my eyes). We were famished by the time we got there so we took the first available seating which was at the counter. We saw how the seafood was hand picked (literally) and prepared.  Service was very attentive as our orders was taken right away. Food came out fast and the hotel that we stayed at (Milo Hotel) gave us a complimentary clam chowder order for this place, it was definitely put to good use. The clam chowder came in a cup, not in the bread bowl. It was more than enough as an appetizer and tasted so good. For our entrees, we had the Rock Crab Special and the Calamari Sandwich. Both orders came with a side of cole slaw and union rings. I am a big seafood lover so getting my hands dirty for that delicious crab was so well worth it. The crab was a little smaller than expected but super fresh and delicious. The Calamari Sandwich was also good, the seafood quality here is unbelievable for the price.

6/6/2018,"Burlingame, CA","I stumbled across this place when I was on Yelp looking for a place to eat some seafood in SB. I believe this was on the top of my search, so I decided to give this place a try! I love the location of this restaurant. It is on the pier and you can drive all the way out with a parking lot next to the restaurant. My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday night around 7:30pm and the wait was about 30 mins. The inside of the restaurant was a lot smaller than expected. We were seated next to the bar by the windows. We started off with a dozen of blue point oysters and a bowl of clam chowder (not photographed). The oysters were a little bit disappointing in size, but I guess that's something out of the restaurant's control. The clam chowder was great with bits of bacon in it. For our entree, we shared a lobster roll that comes with onion rings. The lobster roll was standard and decent, but not something I would order again. Overall, I think this place is more hyped for its location and view. But in terms of the quality of food (from what I've tried), it's a little bit overpriced for what you're getting.",3 star rating,Kristi C.

12/5/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","SB Shellfish is at the end of the pier, surrounded by water on two sides.  The perfect setting for some fresh seafood!A lot of people mention the long wait time here, but I suppose it's the luck of the draw because we arrived just as two seats opened up at the bar and didn't have to wait at all (around 1:30 pm on Sunday, the same time that Karen C mentioned having to wait an entire hour).  If you aren't as lucky as us, there's a sign up list outside by the door - there's no host so this isn't completely obvious.  I opted for an item off the blackboard - the 1.5 pound (live) maine lobster, which they cooked on the grill and served in its shell. For $28.95 it's a steal - nowhere else can you fresh lobster for that price.  Make sure that you are comfortable having to crack open the shell yourself if you go for this option!  Being from Boston, I would want it served no other way.  It was served with my choice of side - salad, fries, or soup - and I opted for the clam chowder.  I usually never order clam chowder outside of Boston but thought that I'd give it a try since this place seemed to be taking their seafood very seriously. It was a solid cup of clam chowder that I would definitely order again.  There were also a couple of onion rings and coleslaw on the side.My bf also ordered off the blackboard and had a pound of the local crab claws, also $28.95 and also served in the shell. He had it with a bloody mary which is probably a pass (not the best mix) but I don't have any other complaints about SB Shellfish.This is a great spot that I wish I lived closer to!BONUS: TJ Miller was eating here when we were there!

9/2/2019,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA","I really wanted to like this place. We stopped here in July and couldn't even get in as the wait was over an hour. We came back in August and we're so sorry we did. They don't take reservations and have an odd waiting system--put your name on a list, then wait outside in the cold (in the upwards of an hour) for the cattle call. Dining inside is very tight and uncomfortable. No actual tables are there and you sit side by side at a bar rather than face to face. Dining outside on or after sunset is positively freezing even with space heaters.We ordered California king crab and lobster pasta--both were a very expensive mistake. The crab was almost impossible to open and there was very little meat. It was also sold to me without knowing it was going to cost $62!  The server did ask if 2.5 lbs was ok. I said yes because she never mentioned (and I'd have never guessed) the actual price which, by the way, was written in small print on a piece of paper posted around the corner on the front of the building where most people wouldn't see it. And $62 for what? 2.5 lbs of shell and not much meat? A complete rip off! And even better, trying to eat the crab was like performing surgery. The shell couldn't be opened with crackers or a mallet; instead, I had to request scissors to cut open the shell. I've eaten crab all my life and this was highly unconventional. The lobster pasta was a disaster. The meat was rubbery and instead of tasting like lobster it tasted like cloves of garlic. The linguine itself was forgettable; it also tasted of heavy garlic. The night we were there the toilets stopped working. That was awesome. You couldn't use them or even wash your hands anywhere. So classy. The server was polite and that's the only positive thing I can say. Overall, this place is not worth the horrifically long wait you'll endure. It's expensive and some of the costs are hidden. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and even another on the pier worth trying. I'd go to one of those before I'd ever consider this place again. Our crappy dinner cost $116.00. We left hungry. If you're foolish enough to eat here, then good luck to you.",1 star rating,John G.

It's really all about the seafood here, everything else (side dishes, drinks, seating, etc) is built around that and kind of more of an afterthought. The night we dined there, we watched crates of something obviously just off a boat get delivered as we were waiting for seating. When our waiter greeted us, he excitedly told us that they'd just received fresh box crab, and recommended we try it. Half of our group opted for these and it was great! Fresh, sweet and tender.

The cioppono came with a generous amount of crab legs on top, and the bread bowl was overflowing with fresh seafood and rich broth. The broth was very salty but didn't keep me from finishing the whole thing. The crab legs tasted super fresh and didn't need much else, other than a little butter. They also have an order window and tables outside if you don't want to wait for a table.

8/29/2017,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a casual restaurant right at the end of Stearns Wharf (the pier at the end of State St). They have some pretty good seafood dishes as well as a decent selection of beer (both draft and bottle) and wines. My family and I ordered the lobster pasta, shrimp and scallop pasta, clam chowder, and a Dungeness crab. The pastas were both pretty good (same base ingredients, just different seafood choices) with a very light flavor which I appreciated since I wasn't looking for anything too heavy during dinner this day. The lobster pieces weren't as substantial as I was hoping for, but for the ~$14 price I think it was expected. My dad said the clam chowder was pretty good and it seemed that you could order it from the window as well if you were just stopping by and ordering to go. So maybe that's something to stop by and try while walking around the wharf. I honestly was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed the crab. It was boiled, plain and simple. And served with a couple (exactly 2) onion rings as well as butter and a cocktail sauce. I always forget how good a quality crab tastes plain and that's exactly how I ate it. Super delicious! Aside from the food, the atmosphere was casual and relaxed. The server that helped us while we sat at the bar (the indoor seating was equivalent to a bar seating) was very nice and friendly! Wish I caught his name. The view from the outdoor seating would always be really nice as well! We came around 6 or 7 pm and I'm sure the sunset views while enjoying your dinner would be great. Just don't forget to bring a light jacket if you're sensitive to the ocean breeze! Overall, I would say this was a solid seafood restaurant in the middle of a heavily touristy area.

8/26/2017,"Castaic, CA","They don't take reservations here so I arrived at the restaurant at about 11:20 (20 mins after it opened), and I was seated inside almost immediately.First thing I ordered was of course a Bloody Mary.  I am on vacation after all, and it seemed like the drink to order here.  The waiter assured me that the Bloody Mary he makes with soju was great, and he did not disappoint.  He also asked me if I wanted it spicy, which of course the answer was ""Yes""! (A Bloody Mary in California must be spicy after all). When it arrived it was more than I expected.  Garnished with a rim of chili, a lime, two pickled green beans, and a celery stick, it looked awesome and gritty.  I liked being able to see peppers and spice in my drinks that give Bloody Marys a nice chewiness.  But most importantly, it tasted amazing.  Full-bodied flavor, but not overly spicy.  The spice does linger a bit, so be warned.Second to come out was the Oyster Shooter.  It looked traditional.  Oyster and cocktail sauce in a shooter glass (which is a little bigger than a shot glass).  But what made it not just good but great was the flavor of the oyster and the addition of shredded parmesan cheese on top.  Awesome.  All oyster shooters should be garnished with strong cheese!!!The next course was their ""Fresh Uni"".  This is uni on top of a raw scallop served on a lime slice.  The uni and scallop were very fresh and not fishy.  Although you do not eat the lime, the small amount of citrus flavor does not go unnoticed.  I tried it with and without the ""ponzu"" sauce (which I think tastes more like a sweetened soy sauce), and I definitely think adding a little sauce really brings out the flavor of the dish.The main course was 2.5lbs of steaming Dungeness Crab.  It was awesome.  Fresh and hot.  Did not smell at all, and was not salty but sweet and tender.  I only wish they did not clean out the head for you.I would also recommend their clam chowder.  It was excellent.  Full of flavor.  I think that it is never a bad idea to order clam chowder at a restaurant on a pier.  Chowder is a dish I can not make myself, nor do I have access to fresh clams like these restaurants do.I hope to be back soon!",5 star rating,Derek H.

There wasn't much of a wait in the beginning as we were seated within 15 minutes, but afterwards we did see a bit of a line outside as it reached towards peak lunch hour.On the menu, there's a variety of seafood options that you can choose. There's various specials too! What we ordered:1. 3 lb Rock Crab Special - comes with clam chowder, onion rings, and salad. The one thing that we didn't notice was that you can opt for them to not ""clean"" out the deliciousness, otherwise they will do it for you. We were kind of disappointed we didn't get to eat the good stuff out of the crab head. But overall, the meat was tender and delicious with the melted butter dip. The clam chowder here is out of this world! The chowder is packed with clams! Worth the money for the special! (5/5)2. Fresh Oysters on the 1/2 Shell - they were fresh and good. Were they as big as the ones we had elsewhere? No, but it was decent (4/5)3. Fresh Sea Urchin (Uni) - SO GOOD! The sea urchin itself is so fresh that it still moves! (see my video). The flavors are spot on and creamy. So worth the price! (5/5)4. Lobster Bisque - this one was a slight disappointment; it had more of a tomato base and lacked the creamy essence of a delicious lobster bisque.

5/30/2016,"Fort Worth, TX","We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",5 star rating,David R.
8/20/2015,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA","You should not come here if you're in a hurry!! The restaurant is extremely small. There were no real tables. It was basically just like a bar throughout the whole place (a bar without a bar. Only one side had a bar, the other side facing the window). It was a long wait; we waited about 2 hours just to get seated. There were a few seatings outside but it would feel really uncomfortable because of the wind blowing on your food since it's right on the pier. I ordered the shrimp and scallops scampi. We didn't wait too long for the food to come out which was good. I really enjoyed my pasta but I wish they added a little bit more shrimp in it. Service was okay, somewhat on the slow side but that's okay since it was packed. Overall, it was a decent experience.",3 star rating,Nhu N.
12/1/2020,"San Francisco, CA","To whomever it may concern , I am a long time dedicated customer of this wonderful establishment, 10 years to be exact ... and even though I live 2hrs away I frequent this place as much as posible through out the year specially for their ciopino in a bowl with a side of garlic bread please ! But I never stop there i always have muscles , a couple dozen oyster  , clam chowder and sometimes the clams. Unfortunately I've realized in the last couple months that it truly matters what day you come and which manager is running the ship ..  Unfortunately I have had A very very I MEAN VERY BAD EXPERIENCE TWICE IN A ROW I BELIEVE IT WAS A MONDAY AND THE SECOND TIME A TUESDAY that I was let down by a mediocre cook which happenED to be the same guy both times.. the manager on mon was very on point with HIS customer service realizing their failure but atleast being humble and informative to the reasons why .. the biggest being that the cook that I enjoy only works Wednesdays and Sundays but Unfortunately that Monday I dropped almost $400 for me my mother and son to enjoy, it was a total failure! The worst ciopino I have ever had anywhere! Which was shocking to say the least ! Then my muscles were so over cooked that they almost disappeared  from their shells and my 3 dozen oysters where massacred totaly destroyed when chucked horrible.  My son was like "" dad this is the place you always talk about because it sucks !"" ""We could be eating better at redando Beach "" what could I say he is a little connoisseur like his dad so he definitely knew what was happening.. I figured it was a fluke how can my spot in my beloved sb be WACK ASS HELL !! BUT THEN TODAY TUESDAY , I CAME IN AT 7:59 pm hoping to see my trusted cook friend even though i already knew he didn't work till Wednesday so I actually told myself I would spend the night in sb just to enjoy some of my favorite grub .. but I still wanted to see if maybe he was there. but he wasn't and the bad cook was  and before I could say anything the manager in charge by the name of !! TONY !! QUICKLY TOLD ME THEY WERE CLOSED EVEN THOUGH THEY CLOSE AT 9 BUT DO CLOSE EARLY IF  SLOW AT 8 PM BUT I STILL WANTED TO PUT THEM TO THE TEST BECAUSE IM A FAN OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE .. so I said !! TONY !! can I just have a clam chowder since I'm here and he said ""yes I can give it to you to go "" so I said cool can I eat it here ? TONY said ""no you cant we are closed "" but TONY I DROVE TwO HOURS TO GET HERE .. THEN TONY SAID  ""IM SORRY there's nothing I CAN Do. I can ONLY GIVE IT TO GO "" I THEN NOTICED THAT HE WAS STILL SERVING FOOD TO THREE TABLES OUT SIDE .. SO I SAID TONY   WHY CANT I ENJOY MY SOUP HERE WHILE EVEYONE ELSE FINISHES THERE FOOD IM SURE I CAN FINISHE MY SOUP BEFORE THEY FINISH THEIR MEALS .. SO WITH A WHATEVER FACE TONY SAYS I GUESS YOU CAN SIT AND EAT YOUR SOUP .. SO I SAID THANK YOU AND ORDERED MY SOUP WITH A SIDE OF TOAST I PAYED AND THEN WAITED FOR MY SOUP AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS SERVED TO GO .. WHEN THE SOUP ARRIVED IT WAS ROOM TEMPERATURE AT BEST AND MY BREAD WAS COLD AND NOT TOASTED AT ALL !  I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY FAILED A SOUP !  DAMN TONY!! SHAME SHAME SHAME ..  I COULDVE JUST ATE OUT OF A CAN LIKE A HOMELESS PERSON AND HAD JUST ABOUT THE SAME EXPERIENCE  ..

7/5/2017,"Woodland Hills, CA","If you want fresh seafood, especially crab, then head to the end of Stearns Wharf. This is a great little spot to enjoy great tasting rock and dungeness crab! This is not a fancy shmancy up-scale restaurant. You go here to enjoy great seafood and ocean scenery.Seating...The restaurant is very small, I'll guess that the inside seats about 15-20 people with a small outdoor area. There's also an option to walk-up to an outside window to order and hope to find a spot on the pier to eat. Waitlist and no reservations... When you walk up to the restaurant entrance write your name on the list and wait to be seated. *Tip: Don't leave, don't walk around, just wait. A lot of people end up leaving (or walk away) and when they get called they will be passed up which means you're within minutes of crab heaven. We went 2 days in a row and our hour and twenty minute wait turned into only 20 minutes. Maybe we just got lucky, but on both days they called several names and they didn't show up. Service... Service is quick and they are on top of every order. Everyone there is nice with local food and community info in their back pockets. Not just crab...The crab is definitely the star but don't pass up the local abalone, fried squid, oysters and the uni on raw scallops. Also goes well with their Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's!",5 star rating,Keith A.

Their seafood is so fresh and it truly tastes that was as well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star review is that it's pretty straightforward seafood, nothing innovative.

Excited about saving money and finding great deal on Groupon, my family was ready to grub!We chose the picnic table and ordered the following:- 3 Kings crab ($24.95 each), comes with either soup (lobster bisque/clam chowder) or salad (garden/caesar)- 1 whole lobster (I believe they boil and then grill it), also comes with soup/salad- 1 crab sandwich (which was recommended..but I don't)Now IF you decide to pick up and eat on the picnic tables right next to this place you'll save $$ on tip!These King crabs are FRESH! and they all have meat in every parts of them!

5/27/2015,"San Francisco, CA","It really doesn't get a whole lot better as far as fresh seafood restaurants. Yes you have to wait in line for it when it's super busy but it's worth the wait. Some people might think that if there wasn't a line it would be better but I don't think that's true. All great seafood stops should be reservation free and first come first serve.  If you have to wait for 15 minutes not a big deal, if it's 3 hours it can be a bit discouraging. I saw the guy clear a whole page of names on the list because no one bothered to stick around and wait. When your name is on the middle of the 3rd page I totally understand being discouraged,  especially when you get hungry. I think we got lucky.   We started off with some clam strips (served with onion rings, tarter and cocktail sauce) and a cup of clam chowder. We ordered it right when we were seated at the bar and it cam within a couple of minutes. We decided to get the Cioppino and split it. I have never had Cioppino in a bread bowl before but it makes the perfect companion. All of the soup soaks in to the bread. It was a healthy sized serving to split. A bunch of crab, scollops, shrimp and clams. They ask you how spicy you want it, we went with a more mild soup and it was perfect for us, just a little bit of kick.  They have a good selection of wine and beer. I was really happy they had Anchor Steam on tap, it goes really good with seafood. They also have a fairly decent Bloody Mary. Top notch service and really good food.",5 star rating,Ben M.

I had the local rock crab with soup and salad. Has the green salad with chowder.  The salad was ehh ok. Chowder was good a solid BThe crab was crab, good a bit underdone but over all ok.  Size was fair, but rock crab are. It know for their size. I finished this off with the sea urchin.  Never have had it but needed to try it   It was severed on a line slice with a slice of scallop. It was good not great.

You can drive your car right onto the wharf and park - or, walk it and enjoy the views. Either way, you'll probably have a wait during dinner hour and you'll be squeezed inside, unless you score one of the four booths outside.  Cards accepted.I had heard about the rock crab special, but after discussing it with the waiter, decided to try the more expensive California king crab instead.  Being from Northern California, I'm a Dungeness crab devotee, and never really hit my stride with the spindly legs of the king crab. Too much work = not enough sweet enjoyment.While we had a decent meal, nothing stood out enough for us to come back. Too many choices in this town!The roundup:  Food: 3 - Not as good as the view.  Service: 3 - Adequate.  Setting: 3 - There are four booths outside; afternoon sun can get hot.  Value: 3 - Not a big fan of the California king crab.  Date worthy: 2 - You can do way better in Santa Barbara!",3 star rating,John H.

4/19/2017,"San Diego, CA","My favorite place to get shellfish (besides fresh off the pier on Saturday mornings). It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) My favorite moment:I will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. Priced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. After that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.But be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. Besides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. Okay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.",5 star rating,Janelle H.

1/13/2017,"Pasadena, CA","Used a Groupon for my most recent visit, I could always save some money when I have expensive tastes! Coming for lunch on a weekday is a big difference from the weekend you can find seating immediately, I prefer inside to outside you don't get stared down by seagulls and you have the excitement of the kitchen. The rock crab special or local crab is what to order, it takes time to eat but you don't even need the accompanying butter and cocktail sauces. Steamed fresh, the sweet crab flavor and tender meat is very nice. People in Vegas pay the price they charge here for a whole hot steaming crab, for just a couple of cold claws. I was a bit sad when I asked my crab to not be cleaned so I can get the delicious crab fat and they brought me put a squeaky clean shell anyways. The onion rings included in the special was just two large rings, just enough to be plural but what the hey better than nothing... The Calamari was okay, comes a good portion of coleslaw if that's your thing. We ordered with a side a fries and they brought it with onion rings. I guess the kitchen was a little off today. The steamed mussels are comfort food, reminds me of meals in Europe. Served in a big bowl of broth with white white, shallots and herbs that's best soaked up with the thick slice of toasted sourdough bread on the side. It's doesn't need anything else but a spritz of lemon or lime.  If you want a more filling meal I suggest going with the pasta version. The uni was fresh, spines still wiggling! They apparently get their shipments from the local fishermen 2-3 times a week. Jumbo sized pieces are mild in flavor, draped over slices of scallop and lime wheels atop crushed ice. The plating is pretty to look at but negatively impacts the flavor. The lime wheels impart a bitterness due to the oils in the rind and the melting ice dilutes the flavor of the already mild uni. Ice works with oysters since they are still on the half-shell. With uni this fresh you don't need the ice, for plating purposes sushi places have it figured out they use ice to stabilize the shell as a bowl and place the uni on a neutral filler medium. Eh, still the price is on point and Santa Barbara is famous for the quality of their uni.",4 star rating,Karen C.
8/31/2018,"Alhambra, CA",Only waited 15 minutes for food-- went around sunset. It is a filling meal-- onion rings went well with the coleslaw. The lobster was fresh and worth the price. It came with butter sauce. Tip: Ask for french fries for the onion rings.,3 star rating,Ivy C.

1/2/2015,"Arcadia, CA","It was really great with the view, food and having fun to watch the chef cooking at the bar.It was a cold night but my friends and i were really craving a fresh seafood because this is Santa Barbara. The way to this restaurant is so pretty and have a incredible view, located the end of the wharf. It was 7pm and a couple of groups ahead of us. Even though waiting 20mins, we were not bored at all. Watching the chef cooking behind the glass panel was so hilarious. We were seated at the bar area and we could watch more hilarious scenes.This shack is a kinda hole-in-the-wall place and tight but the ambiance was so friendly and unusually warm. We ordered the beer and Spider Crab instantly which we have seen over the glass panel. They served the two kinds of soups and salad on the house. The clam chowder was so heaven tasty and the salad was so fresh and crunch. After waiting 15 mins, the steamed spider crab came out. It's about 7lbs and looked a huge mountain. Because the winter is not the season of the crab, there was not enough meat inside the shell. But we were enjoy the food, service and cooking show and view as a tourist.",5 star rating,Sun H.

9/10/2017,"San Diego, CA","Looking for great seafood in Santa Barbra? Then this is the place to get it. This place is located right on the end of Stearns Wharf. If you are able to get to the wharf early enough, I definitely recommend parking there. If not, it might be best to find parking on the side street. The place is very small and casual, typical for places on the beach. If you're able the tables outsides have a great view of the ocean. They usually have a longer wait time, but adds nice atmosphere to your meal.Got there at about noon and the place was packed. The wait time was about 30 mins to an hour. Wasn't in any rush so we waited about one hour to get in. Looking around the outside of the restaurant you can see that the seafood was being caught there and absolutely fresh! Safe to say I was excited enough to wait. I recommend getting there early if you have less time on your hands. Most people seem to put their name on the waiting list and enjoy what the wharf has to offer before coming back. Got seated right at the bar. It was cool being able to see the food being cooked right in front of us. Our server was friendly and very sociable. Ordered the garlic baked clams to start off with. They were very fresh and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. We also ordered the shrimp tacos and the fried calamari, shrimp, & scallop combo with onion rings.All in all, solid seafood place. Definitely, recommend getting when at Stern's wharf.",4 star rating,Lianne L.

3/10/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Little ""shack"" at the end of the pier. We arrived on Sunday for brunch around noon and waited for about five minutes. If it's a pretty day I really suggest sitting outside... the ocean view while you eat is spectacular. We shared the oysters of the day and rock crab legs for our apps. All three of my girlfriends ordered the half lobster + choice of soup/salad. I ordered the lobster roll. Both entrees came with a little bit of really really good onion rings. +rock crab legs - shorter, stubbier legs than I'm used to. Very meaty and fresh. Dish comes with 3 pieces for about $12. I really enjoyed it.+kusshi oysters + Morro Bay oysters - kusshi oysters were smaller in size, but they were both so fresh with such a clean flavor. + lobster bisque - Soup of the day. More of a tomato soup flavor that overpowered the very minute lobster flavor... and no lobster meat in it. It was good, but expected more.+ lobster roll - HUGE chunks of lobster mixed with chives and other veggies and no mayo, which I loved! The lobster was fresh and fat. Obsessed. I barely ate it with the roll because the roll was very dry and flavorless... mostly picked at the lobster filling with my fork. I still enjoyed it. I just wish the roll was buttered and toasted... would've made it the best lobster roll ever. Coleslaw was fresh and light. I liked the chunks of pineapple/raisins/macaroni. + half lobster - Ssooo fresh with no extra spice or flavor. Simplicity at its finest.They offer pitchers of beer for a good price. We got a pitcher of Hef for $18. I really enjoyed everything about our lunch... from the ambiance to the quality of the food. I highly recommend anyone visiting Santa Barbara to bookmark this spot.",5 star rating,Elysse P.

I looked to the yelping community to guide me. This place have 4 stars and over 1400 reviews so I'm thinking it would be a solid choice. Mistake. The positive: the seafood IS fresh. I will not disparage the quality but it's about as well seasoned as dry cardboard. Everything was bland! The coconut shrimp, the coleslaw, the crab sandwich. Hell, the onion rings were bland. I don't think the cook knows what seasoning is. I'm sorely disappointed. In hindsight I would chosen the many other options at Stearns Wharf. Places with no line... to wait 30 minutes for paper disguised as seafood. It hurts my heart. I'm more so disappointed in the community for putting all the extras on it. SMH",2 star rating,Richard S.

1/23/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","If you are going for the quintessential Santa Barbara seafood experience, you should check this place out. It is located right at the very end of the Santa Barbara pier. There are maybe, four?, small tables on the outside deck which face the ocean. Super cute and quaint. With that said, prepare for a long wait if you are coming during peak hours.I shared the following items:-Santa Barbara shrimp cocktail: seven jumbo, chilled shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemons for drizzling. They were pretty substantial in size and the shrimp themselves had a slight hint of sweetness. $12.95 for the seven shrimp.-a half dozen oysters on the half shell: they go for market price (in my case, $18 for 6) and we weren't offered a variety of oysters. I think they serve whatever is available for the day.Okay, and against my better judgement, I opted to try their popular Rock Crab special which I believe, comes with a side of soup (good, creamy clam chowder in my case) and a small salad for a reasonable price tag of $21(ish) dollars. Oh, the crab is also topped with onion rings. Mind you, my experience with eating crab doesn't go beyond dungeness crab which usually breaks into lumps of sweet, crab meat. The texture of the rock crab is nothing like that. The meat is slightly grainy and doesn't easily form into lumps, so I found myself with little strips/pieces of crab meat. The exoskeleton of the rock crab is also incredibly hard, so I really had to work for that crab meat. This was a less than desirable crab eating experience. It is what it is. I am usually not a fan of American seafood fare, so I thought for what it was, it was good.",3 star rating,Trung N.

Can handle like 4 dishes going on at once and didn't burn a single thing. Impressive.Husband and I ordered:Fried shrimp and calamari - subbed fries instead of onion rings. This was delicious!!

Nice and thick, creamy soup with plenty of clams.lobster pasta: ughh this garlic butter white wine sauce with linguini and chucks of lobster totally hit the spot.

6/23/2017,"San Jose, CA","I saw this place on Yelp, and it had a very high rating. Like any highly raved restaurant, I wanted to actually experience it myself to see what's all the hubbub. I have to say... this place lives up to its high rating.I started with some clam chowder. Then, I ate the heaviest Dungeness Crab. Finally, I tried their Abalone Risotto. Meal after meal, it was truly spectacular. [ Clam Chowder ] : perfectly seasoned. I can tell they really made the chowder well.[ Dungeness Crab ] : They cut it in half and boiled it, which is fine and all, but it did lose some of its flavors to the boiling water. However, the meat inside is just insanely abundant.[ Abalone Risotto ] : The risotto was super yummy. I think it was some kind of sauce with butter, Italian parsley, and white wine. They only gave a few slices of abalone, but it was heavenly.Overall, I highly recommend this place when you visit Santa Barbara. It's right on a pier next to the ocean.

I asked the parking attendant and they said there is parking outside available which is probably a better bet in my opinion. Wait time: Crazy... both for dining in and ""taking out"".I opted for the take out method since it was less of a wait and there were tables outside where you can sit  and eat at so why not?  Communal style so get ready to become buddies with your neighbors! Service: Super slow.... I can't believe it took me 45 minutes to put in my order! The WORST PART... they were taunting me when I got to the window because they made me wait for another 10 minutes so they could call out the orders. SAD LIFE!Food: Rock Crab Plate They weren't lying when they called it a ROCK CRAB plate. It was literally hard as a rock and the clamps used to crack the shell weren't strong enough so I barely got any crab out. One of the claws, in fact, became a snack for the birds. LUCKY THEM.  Fried Calamari/ Oyster Plate Fried to perfection, not overly breaded and both items were super fresh! Not a big fan of cole slaw in general, but it was actually quite tasty I actually finished the whole portion. Clam chowder The temperature of the soup could be warmer, but the taste and the amount of ingredients in it made up for it. Final Verdict: A-okay.",3 star rating,Annie L.
11/10/2014,"Torrance, CA","Located the end of Stearn Wharf in Santa Barbara. Got here around 2 pm and had to wait about 30 minutes. Must be a good thing, and it was. Another option is you can order from the take-out menu and eat at the picnic benches on the wharf. Only drawback I see with this option is no wait service and you'll be competing with sea gulls for your own food. Sat down and ordered the lobster roll, live rock crab special, clam in white wine sauce, clam chowder, and deep fried shrimp and calamari. Also ordered a couple of side salads.Everything was really good except for the lobster roll. The rock crab was prepared steamed and came with butter and cocktail dipping sauces. No need for the sauces cause the crab had a nice sweet and meaty flavor to it. Must try.The clam in white wine sauce was spot on. Tasted fresh and the sauce was just right. Hint of that wine along along with a hint of garlic. Pair that the saltiness from the clams and wallah...perfection.Clam chowder was pretty good with just enough thickness and ample amount of clams. No need to dash pepper and salt cause the flavors were all there.The trio of deep fried shrimp and calamari was okay. The batter stayed on with every bite and was on the lighter side considering it was deep fried. Might be a good option for younger kids who don't care for fresh seafood.The lobster roll was somewhat disappointing. It lacked depth. I had to dash some salt and pepper because it was going nowhere with every bite. Plus, I think the lobster roll had too many fillers like celery. That lobster essence just wasn't there. Service was very attentive. The place is small so expect to sit bar style unless you sit at one of the four tables outside.

2/12/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","The best thing about this place is the crazy seafood cook who wrangles insanely huge crabs and lobsters like it ain't no thing. He pulls 'em out of the tank, weighs them and then gets to work smashing their legs and shit. It's super fascinating but also kind if hard to watch. Don't come here if you care about animal rights. The rock crab special we ordered was disappointing. I suppose it's because I'm used to King crab, but the texture of the meat was watery and white white white! It was hard to tell if it was cooked through or not. It also had a very mild flavor. I wouldn't ever get it again. The shrimp and scallop pasta we had was fine, but nothing spectacular -- and the scallops were not seared or sautéed at all. Just lil white lumps that were still raw so I had to tuck them under the pasta to finish off the cooking. The pan sauce was good, nice and garlicky. And the shrimp were plump and well cooked. We asked for some bread to sop up the pasta juices and they gave us a bowl of bread chunks -- one of which was moldy. The rest were stale, but I feel like I can't hold that against them because bread was not on the menu or offered as an appetizer. Oh-- and the lobster bisque and Caesar salad were GREAT! I hadn't had a Caesar in forever and this one was a great reminder of how much I really do love that salad.The view is great and the service is excellent.

7/29/2016,"Pismo Beach, CA","I was in Santa Barbara for a meeting the other morning and decided we should have lunch somewhere by the water. We went exploring and ended up at the pier/wharf. The places there had pretty poor ratings as it is very touristy. This was the most highly rated. We had to wait quite a bit as it is tiny inside with only a few outside tables. We were eventually seated at the bar and had a delightful server named John. He was friendly, personable, informative, efficient, and very industrious. And all this while the place was packed. The main cooking area is right behind the bar so you can see the food being prepared. Nice open kitchen!I ordered the Crab Louis. It's all came out quite fresh though I prefer a more classic one with iceberg lettuce. This one was the typical California Mixed Green variety. Rabbit Food! Afterwards I was still in the mood for some other seafood. I chose the Rock Crab Claws. I was forewarned at the beginning that the local crab is not as tasty as Alaskan. And it was true. The crab meat had no flavor. It wasn't bad. It was clearly fresh. Just absolutely no flavor. Jack had the Cioppino. It was served in a sour dough bowl. Very tourist San Francisco-like!!! (We used to live there.) I found the broth to be lacking in depth of flavor. We ordered it spicy. It was. But I tasted mostly paprika.We had wine and beer. A nice assortment of drafts and wine by the glass was available. They also had San Pellegrino sparkling water.I loved the setting and the atmosphere and the fantastic service. Divey to touristy.

8/31/2016,"WARNER SPGS, CA","Visited 8/25/2016In town for the evening we were looking for some fresh seafood and after asking around this is where we ended up.It's a small place at the end of The Wharf Pier with a small amount of counter seating inside and only 4 or 5 Tables outside.  A very busy place with some fresh seafood.  Don't go by their web site menu as they don't offer much that's listed on there.  That was very disappointing as their quite limited with choices.The fried seafood combo was just ok, nothing special.  2 1/2 Stars.The 3 Pound Rock Crab Special was not bad with the crab tender and plentiful. The Crab Meat Was A Bit Flavorless compared to a Dungeness crab.  It comes with soup and salad and 1 Onion Ring. 3 1/2 Stars.The Onion Rings are very Good.  4 Stars.The Shrimp Bisque was the hit of the night. Great Flavor.  4 Stars.A good place for a snack but for a Seafood Dinner I'll Be going elsewhere.",3 star rating,Robert Z.

I paid $20 for a disappointing lunch of a sad Cesar salad that was missing something and had brown lettuce, and a shrimp and avocado salad type dish. The greens in this dish were perfect though, so a star for that! TWENTY BUCKS. It was packed inside so I ordered at the window and ate at a table outside harassed by pigeons the whole time.",2 star rating,I Need A.

9/13/2016,"Irvine, CA","There's an overwhelming amount of reviews to this place that sparked my boyfriend and I's interest to edge of the pier for some delicious seafood.  It's a small little restaurant with quite a bit of a wait.  Nothing like peering at the vast views of Santa Barbara from this location while waiting.Loved the deal for the rock crab.  It came with a soup and salad.  The soup, clam chowder was amazing.  Creamy with the right amount of seasoning and clams.  I could eat an entire bowl of this. Just thinking about this while I write my review is making my mouth water.  The rock crab was just as great.  It took awhile to break through the shell for the meat but nothing could have gone wrong with it.  The best crab of the day was the king crab.  Oh that tender meat dipped in butter.  It just melts in your mouth.  Everything about this crab was amazing. Cutting through this crab's shell was easier than the rock crab but be careful as it might squirt juices onto the other person next to you.Definitely a go to place in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Jackie H.
1/11/2015,"Sacramento, CA","Was craving some really fresh seafood, particularly crab today so the fiancé and I decided to drive up to SB. Using my handy-dandy Yelp app, I found Shellfish as the go-to restaurant according to what I wanted. Shellfish in located at the end of State St. on the Santa Barbara pier. You obtain a parking ticket, the first 90 mins is free, but you can also get it validated at the restaurants. I walk in & am a bit confused because there is no one physically there to greet you. I ask a server, ""do we need to sign in somewhere"" and she just said yes. I had to walk out by myself to figure out that you had to sign a clip board by the front door. It would have been nice, if the server showed me where the clip board was... I am not a regular, as many of the customers weren't so we don't know what the normal protocol is in needing a table. Better yet, there should be a sign up informing customers that there is a sign in sheet-nice and clear and Big enough to see. Just a thought.Once seated, we were at the bar counter. It was a bit tight but it was the only table available- outdoor seating with a table, would have taken longer and we were starving. Nice thing is they offer bag hooks under the counter- that helps because there really no space at the counter.I ordered the Local Steamed Crab, which included a small crab, 2 onion rings stuck together ( so technically one onion ring) and a small side of coleslaw. The crab shells were really hard to break. The legs in my crab were the smallest I've ever seen. It was so hard to break the shells off, about half way in I was so over it. It took so much work cracking the shells-mid point annoyed.Coming from the Bay Area, where we would go to half moon bay for fresh crab in the morning, I am so used to shells being easy to crack, after steaming them with black bean sauce... Shells easy to crack, meant they were fresh. Just sayin. I only ate half of my crab and was totally over it. Thankfully the coleslaw was good, so that helped my hunger. The fiancé ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl. The soup was delicious, but the bread bowl was stale and really hard. It was really only used as a bowl. The clam chowder definitely does not compare to what you get in SF! Overall, I had high expectations because of the many positive Yelp reviews and it's location- SB pier. Sadly my expectations were definitely not met, and We most likely won't return.",3 star rating,Charlene G.
10/12/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","This place was the only place with a lot of stars and over 600 yelpers were on board stating it was good...Unfortunately this place was simply okay. There is a sign in sheet by the door and the place is a small restaurant and maybe a five table seating outside, inside seemed crowded.After standing there I noticed a side window and tables across the way, felt that we were hungry and really didn't want to wait.Went with the shrimp and scallop pasta dish with linguine and it wasn't outstanding, it was okay. Also tried their clam chowder and the clams were non existing. My date tried their shrimp tacos (2) with some rice, she said they were okay, nothing great either.Bill came out to $45 for just okay food.

5/30/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","I bookmarked this place when my family and I were staying in SB for a day. I expected that lines would be super long for a weekday so we went to the pier (where the restaurant's located) and put our name down at 4:45pm (you can choose to sit inside, outside, or whatever's available). The waiting time took around 30-40 minutes, which I expected as the restaurant as pretty small and couldn't fit a large crowd. So we sat down close to 6pm and enjoyed the experience. Parking: there is parking on the pier, but you'd have to get there early before rush hour to snag a spot. Free parking for the first 90 minutes I believe and then $1.50 for each hour after that (I think).Food: Food was good, not exceptionally as amazing as I had imagined it to be (which is why I took off a star there).Waiting time: Waiting for our food took a while, but there was also only one waiter serving everybody sitting outside. Service from the waiter was really good - he took care of us even though he was busy managing the other tables as well. Would I come back? Maybe not. This was more of a ""I'm glad I tried it experience but would rather explore other restaurants the next time I'm in SB.""",4 star rating,Amy T.

Not the case here.Pros: despite how busy it was the staff was friendly and super efficient. The shrimp bisque (seasonal) was yummy.",3 star rating,Leslie J.

We got a half dozen of oysters that were possibly the best we've ever had and we both live in San Diego and San Francisco so we know a little bit about seafood...onion rings (which were fat and flaky so they melt in your mouth), and garlic baked clams that were really good.

5/25/2019,"San Francisco, CA","All things considered, overrated.  Waited an hour to order to sit outside. Waiting for a seat inside would've been another 30 minOrdered the following:- 6 uni on top of raw scallop ($22) they were on top of some really rancid limes that made the entire bite bitter. Completely ruined the Uni.-lobster bisque ($9) - more like tomato bisque. Didn't have any lobster flavor at all not worth it- crab cakes ($15) - bland. Too many breadcrumbs? Are rock crabs just bland? I dont know but I've had better crab cakes made from canned crab. - 2lb rock crab ($23) this was ok but nowhere near as delicious as maryland blue crab. 2lb = 1 crab- linguine & clams $15- prob the only really decent dishWe paid nearly $95 to wait an hour for really poor quality seafood. Did we order the wrong dishes??? I don't know, but we went to Lure Seafood the next day for happy hour and it was a much better experience. Will not come again.",2 star rating,Trish M.
2/14/2016,"Anaheim, CA","Beautiful view on the Santa Barbra pier. We waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday night. I recommend you to sit outside ! The inside was small and seemed cramped. First off our waitress was friendly through out our meal. We ordered some local favorites:Clam chowder & tomato bisque - super fresh clams, creamy and smokey from the bacon. Tomato bisque was light yet flavorful ! Would order these again.Caesar salad - didn't come with dressing, it was tossed in olive oil but still good.Lobster roll - DO NOT ORDER ! The bread was already ripping when we got it. The lobster are not whole pieces .. It's shredded up with a weird  mayo sauce and has capers. I've never had a lobster roll with capers before. It just made the whole roll salty and mushy. Pass on this.Fried oysters, shrimp & calamari - huge juicy oysters, sweet and perfectly cooked shrimp, & flavorful calamari. I liked this dish a lot.Rock crab - I wasn't aware that they clean the crabs before hand unless you tell them not to ): I love crab guts ! However the cleaned crab was ok, not a lot of meat for the price but we still enjoyed it.Overall I like this place and would come back :)",4 star rating,Jackie L.

My wife and I have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time. This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small.

Those seagulls can be pretty vicious...(I'm terrified of birds so thank goodness we found a little bench off to the side of the restaurant safe from those monstrous creatures..)My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a snack and try something from this famous restaurant. The rock crab seems to be the house favorite but we wanted something more than just crab so we opted for the cioppino in a bread bowl ($18.95). We expected it to come with all the seafood out of their shells. Boy, were we terribly wrong! It literally came with a leg of rock crab, and mussels and clams in their shells. At least the shrimp was ready to eat. Thus, it was a bit hard to eat the bowl but still delicious. The bread bowl itself was a little stale but still yummy once drenched in the sauce.I'd be back to try the lobster tacos and maybe the rock crab once I'm in the mood!",4 star rating,Hana J.

9/20/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","It was 6PM. My roommate and I drove for the entire day and ended up in Santa Barbara looking for fresh uni. I went to the fish market and they had just sold out. I was near devastated. Then someone heard someone else say that Santa Barbara Shellfish Co had a special for sea urchin the day we were there. We put our name down for an expected 1.5 hour wait. I swung by the side of the restaurant to see slew of people waiting for pickup order. You can apparently order the whole menu to go. So we got in this line...and waited....and waited..then waited some more. Almost 2 hours passed until we eventually ordered and got our food. Is it worth the wait? Probably not. Was the food good? Definitely good. I ordered the sea urchin special with scallops atop limes (the special of the day) and also the oyster Rockefeller (baked oysters with butter). Both dishes were delicious..but the time and effort it took was insanity. Most people seemed like tourists (we were one of them).

Fried Seafood Combo- the oysters were juicy and huge! You get 2! Everything else in it is ok. But for $12.95 its a pretty sweet portion!! The side of coleslaw was refreshing with all the fried goods too. I definitely recommend this. Also tried the uni special (17.95 or 18.95 i forget). Its a piece of uni on top of scallop and lime.

11/20/2019,"Long Beach, CA","We were visiting Santa Barbara as a few days getaway with my boyfriend. After searching for a decent place to eat, we picked the SB shellfish company (our pick was Influenced by an average 4 star reviews from yelp). We ordered clam chowder in a cup, clam chowder in a bread bowl, pasta with shrimp and scallops , lobster tacos and red wine and beer. My red wine came in scratched and dirty looking shot glass instead of wine glass. My clam chowder was served in a coffee mug, the other clam chowder was served in a very stale sourdough breadbowl. I love sourdough bread and tried the part that get cut off from the middle. It tasted like it was week old, so I did not eat it.  My pasta seemed slightly undercooked with watery white soupy looking sauce, the shrimp and scallops were fully cooked but zero flavor. Lobster tacos were tasteless. Many reviews gave extra stars to this place based on a ""view"" of the ocean, which makes average ratings for this place higher than it should be. We spent $82 plus tip and I will never go to eat there again.*update: my boyfriend got sick with stomach ache later that night and we can't think of anything other than greasy tacos causing this, since it was the only meal during the day.",1 star rating,Vera G.

Butter and delicious. Everything was grilled or cook in front of us at the bar. Delicious! Now the service. Friendly and attentive. Explained menu, specials and let me sample the brews on tap.

8/4/2014,"Glendale, CA","We started off a friend's birthday celebration with some serious grubbing here.  The wait sucks at this popular spot, but the hostess told us that a lot of people put their name on the list and then end up leaving so the wait isn't as bad as it could be.  I saw the good reviews on Yelp, but still thought this place might be more of a tourist trap.  By the time I had one of the STEAMED CLAMS though, my mind changed.  It was a good-sized bowl for sharing and the perfectly steamed clams came in some white wine garlic broth.Make sure to check out the specials.  The most important one being THE ROCK CRAB SPECIAL.  For $25, you get a 3 lb crab plus soup and salad and even some onion rings.  It's a better value than the steamed 1.5 lb crab.  My friend and I split this and decided on two soups (clam chowder and lobster bisque).  The chowder was better.  We also split the LOBSTER ROLL served with a side salad and more onion rings.  The roll was pretty good, with nice chunks of tender lobster.Our group tried a couple of the draft beers, getting a pitcher each of the KONA LAGER and the FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN IPA.  Seafood and beer definitely go together.Service was great and our server brought out an OYSTER SHOOTER on the house for the birthday girl.  This shooter is non-alcoholic with a raw oyster in a shot glass with some cocktail sauce, lemon, horseradish and parmesan cheese.",5 star rating,Carol L.

The highlight for me was the peel and eat shrimp. Perfectly cooked with a good sauce. The crab was also good, I found it easier to separate the meat that at other crab places. My girlfriend enjoyed her lobster roll and claimed the onion rings are the best she has had in her life. My shrimp tacos were good, just a little bland.",4 star rating,Jack K.

I had held off on eating fried food for awhile and there was nothing more I wanted than a giant plate of fried seafood goodness with a pint of beer, which is exactly what I got. We also got a rock crab, which we've never had.

9/8/2015,"Huntington Beach, CA","Its TST:  Two Star Tuesday again!!! (and my 100th Two Star review)I heard some great things about the local rock crab, oysters & uni at SB Shellfish, so I said I had to hit this place.  It is located at the end of Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara.  BTW, parking on the wharf is free for the first 90 min, and valet is complimentary.Four of us ordered 1/2 dozen oysters (MP|$15.75 for 2 of each of the 3 varieties avail), rock crab special ($26 inc onion rings, soup & salad), rock crab ($16,95 - onion rings & coleslaw), crab cakes ($13.95 - not pictured), steamed clams ($13.95), and a bowl of clam chowder ($8.95 - not pictured).  Unfortunately, there was no uni available (the bulk of uni served in So CA comes from Santa Barbara).First of all, the oysters were not good.  They were not fresh, and the start of things to come.  In addition, the shucking was sloppy:  2 Stars.  Not surprisingly, the signature crab was a big disappointment.  The special is advertised as a 3 lb crab, that makes it sound larger compared to the rock crab w/o salad and soup.  However, it was the same size.  In addition, the head was cleaned, and the crab was overcooked.  Or it was cooked, frozen and then reheated.  The head should always include the innards to show the freshness.  Likewise, the meat was stringy, and did not have much taste w/o the butter.  The foregoing was despite seeing a bunch of fresh crabs in the window.  Lastly, the soup was decent, but the salad was limp.  The soup was not as good as Splash Cafe up the road in Pismo Beach.  While the salad was like something you buy at the market after the expiration date:  1 Star overall for rock crab special.Thirdly, the crab cakes were OK.  My cousin said they were edible, but nothing special:  3 Stars.  The same goes for the steamed clams.  They were nowhere near as good as The Deck in Laguna Beach, that contain garlic & portuguese sausage in the broth.  Additionally, the bread was stale:  2.5 Stars.Regarding the ambiance, you put your name at the front and have a choice between indoor & outdoor seating.  Alternatively, we chose to order from the window and eat at the benches.  Either way, its all paper plates:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the service was good.  The person taking our order was nice (as were the valets), the order was correct, and the food came out quickly.  Nonetheless, a big minus was no sanitary wipes!  How can you serve this messy a$$ food and not offer wipes?!:  3 Stars.Honestly, I don't know what the allure is here other than the view.  The signature dish was falsely advertised as being fresh and larger compared to the rock crab by itself, and the other dishes were primarily average or bad in the case of the salad.  If the service was bad, this place would have made my ATJAAC (Avoid This Joint At All Costs) List!",2 star rating,Joe P.

8/31/2015,"Las Vegas, NV","The perfect setting with fresh seafood! I'm starting this review off with a tremendous thank you to my fellow yelper from Santa Barbara, Justin R! He recommended this place and I'm still thinking about it! Located on the pier it has just 4 outdoor tables and my girls and I were incredibly lucky to score one with about a 10 min wait which was nothing. I would have waited over an hour for one of those tables :)We sat outside breathing in the salty air and the weather was perfect. The service was great and we decided on taking advantage of some of the fresh daily catches like the rock crab, shrimp and I hit the gold mine with Santa Barbara uni! We also ordered crab cakes that came with onion rings & coleslaw and some delicious Caesar salads with lobster & crab bisques. We loved it all!I'm going to take a moment for all the uni lovers out there. I've never ever had an uni experience like this and I feel the need to talk about it! The uni was so fresh that the shell of it was still moving on my plate. It was an incredible foodie moment and I felt the need to take video. I watch it all the time. Is that sick? Maybe so...This is a must stop when in Santa Barbara. I know that there are so many great places to eat here but there's something extra special about eating fresh seafood outside on the pier!

5/29/2014,"San Diego, CA","I've seen the long lines and have always been intrigued. Once Groupon had an offer, I jumped all over it!We tried to go there about an hour before it closed on a Sunday night and they had already stopped taking reservations by then. It was still packed, so we opted to go on Memorial Day. Once we put our name down, they said it would take about 40 minutes, and their timing was right. It was a beautiful day, so we had no problem just enjoying the view from the pier.We opted for first available and got some seats in the corner near the bathroom. I was glad we got an indoor seat since the wind started picking up and it got a little chilly. We decided to splurge and got the 3lb. Rock Crab special for $24.95(comes with onion rings, soup and salad), the lobster roll $18.95(it's a cold roll that comes with slaw, but beware, the slaw has raisins...), and we also had oysters: 2 blue point, 2 chef creek and 2 kumiai. While all very good, our preference was chef creek then blue pint then kumiai. They were all distinct but we tend to like the creamier oysters. When selecting the soup, I asked our server what he recommended, and he said clam chowder all the way. He didn't steer us wrong; it was creamy, full of goodies and was just delicious. This definitely up in the running for one of my favorite chowder places in SB.The salad was ok, and didn't stand out too much. The lobster roll was filled with capers and had a good mix of flavors. Since we lived in Boston for a while, the bf's first comment was ""it's good, but the roll is all wrong"". He was right, the lobster was very tasty and they didn't overpower it with mayo. We aren't fans of raisins, so we picked them all out, and after that we enjoyed the slaw.The rock crab deal was for 3lbs, so in addition to a whole crab, they gave us another 1/2 to get to the weight they promised. The bf felt it was a little overcooked and too flaky. I thought it was ok, and realized this isn't my favorite type of crab to eat in this way. I probably won't order it again. Not because of how it's served, but the texture wasn't what I enjoy as much as other types of crab (like the blue dungeoness crab, that's my fave!)Also, there are so many other things to try, so when I come back, I'll look forward to tasting other things. The service is pretty great. This place is always slammed, and our server was very tentative and patient. We never felt rushed even as we methodically worked our way through the crab.They also have a take out window, and if you don't want any alcohol, it's a great alternative than waiting for a table. Can't wait to come back!",4 star rating,Kim V.

The brunch menu was fabulous, the food was delicious. We came just because of its lovely location right on the beach. The only downside I would have to say, is that it's a dog beach, and the cute little playground area is right in front of the restaurant. I actually thought that it might be part of the restaurant. They don't actually allow dogs inside the restaurant or patio area, but be prepared to weave you way through a bunch of wet, sandy dogs, in order to enter the restaurant. So with that on mind, it might be better to go to the restaurant in the evening, when there is less dog traffic.",5 star rating,Meredith L.

I also got the cioppino and it was soooo good - like seafood should always taste like :DUnfortunately, I don't have anything good to say about the lobster roll.

10/16/2015,"San Jose, CA","It's a small place at the end of the pier in Santa Barbara.  It's first come, first serve.  We put our name down on the list and waited for about 30 min to get seated at the counter.  You're able to see everything going on back there, which I love.  You see the cooks going to work getting all your food together, it's awesome.  It does get a little hot in there, but you know the saying, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!""...LITERALLY!  I ordered one of their specials which was the abalone over rice.  I've never had abalone before so I was a bit skeptical, but what the heck right?  Life is all about trying new things and I'm so happy I did.  If you've never had abalone, the consistency of it is a mix between a clam and squid.  It's lightly fried and set over the rice...the only problem was, I wish I had more.  My cousin ordered the cioppino and she devoured it!  We also ordered 1/2 a dozen oysters which were super fresh and delicious.  I loved this place.  I will be back to try the other items and specials next time I'm in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Leizel B.
9/23/2015,"Irvine, CA","Located at the end of the pier, Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is a must try!Parking on the pier itself is free for the first 90 minutes, but has a limited amount of spots. Parking on nearby streets is free and has a 90 minute time limit as well, so I recommend searching for a spot on the pier first. We arrived at Santa Barbara Shellfish Company around 1pm on a Monday afternoon. To my surprise, there was a wait list for tables! There were about 4 unseated parties on the list when we arrived and a waitress estimated the wait to be about 20 minutes. The restaurant itself is pretty small, with indoor and outdoor seating. I would not recommend coming here with more than 2 people. There is also a take out window with the same menu selection and no line, so we opted to order there instead. My friend and I decided upon the lobster pasta and coconut shrimp dishes to share. We were contemplating on whether to order the scallop ceviche instead of the coconut shrimp and the guy taking our order convinced us into getting the shrimp, stating it's one of his favorite dishes. I'm pretty glad that we went with his recommendation, as the coconut shrimp was delicious! Although the shrimp are fried, the coconut batter is not overbearing and you can still see and taste the shrimp inside! The onion rings and coleslaw it comes with are ok and could be better. The lobster pasta is a must try! There are very generous portions of lobster and the pasta itself is perfect- not too creamy or oily. If you are only able to try one thing on the menu, please let this be it.There are a few picnic benches outside the takeout window, where plenty of people sit to eat. Luckily, the few birds flying around the pier were nice and didn't viciously try to steal our food! If you're looking for dessert, there's a cute ice cream shop a few steps away (near public restroom)!",5 star rating,Christy K.

This place had it all!Now I can tell from the reviews that some people didn't have good food here, but our food was very good. We started with a pitcher of beer (can't go wrong!) and onion rings. The onion rings were tasty, but the sauce served with it was just ok. I got the seafood cioppino, and my husband got the lobster tacos. The lobster tacos were just ok...We kind of only tasted corn tortilla because it felt like the lobster needed more seasoning (or at least salt). Also the sauce served with it was a little bland. But my cioppino was VERY GOOD. If you've never had cioppino it is basically a seafood stew in a tomato broth, and this one is served in a bread bowl with parmesan cheese on top. There was a TON of seafood in it (crab, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels), and all of it was cooked and seasoned well. I was very impressed!Overall, the food is a little hit or miss, but we had a good time, and I would recommend it! Get the cioppino!",4 star rating,Jessi C.

8/13/2015,"Culver City, CA","We had a Groupon that was worth $40 off for 4 people.They should call it Shellfish Shack because it is a hole in the wall on the pier. There are no tables inside just a bar and one single shelf around the perimeter with a dozen chairs with window views. There are 4 picnic tables outside if you need to sit together. The wait is Long, but there is a walk up window to order then sit at ample seating outside.This is a shellfish company. There is very little else on the menu that isn't from a shell or local. We tried the fresh Santa Barbara shrimp, Ridgebacks I think. They were good, fresh and a bit messy with all that shrimp head juice. A lady next to us ordered the sea urchin and it was so fresh it was still moving. Fascinating. Clam Chowder, very good, creamy with plenty of clams and bacon. Oyster shooters, sure. Saucy and fresh horseradish. I had a crab sandwich served on grilled sourdough. Not very exciting but a safe bet. They had off menu chicken nuggets for the kids. $18 pitchers of several local or CA beers. The crab tanks are full if you want to make a mess and pick through all those shells. Daughter had crab cakes and they were fine with good amount of crab. This is definitely a tourist place not a trap, with plenty of locals I'm sure. Our server was Killer.

It is a little more briney than their bigger brethren down in the Redondo beach wharf. The clam chowder was probably the worse I've eaten. They have enough of clams in there to please but it had no seasoning or salt in it that I can discern. If they threw some salt and pepper in there, there would probably be a winding line. I am just came for clam chowder and uni. I won't order any more Santa Barbara uni because that briney taste isn't enough to bring me back. The service is friendly and great.

We tried to get a drink at the bar and were treated very rudely because apparently you must order drinks in the giant line for to-go orders that took 20 mins to get through. However, we were able to procure drinks due to a very friendly woman from Houston (who also bought us a bottle of rose later for my birthday) which made the wait tolerable.

Tortillas were kind of dried out so I wrapped the shrimp and avocado in one tortilla and ate them that way. Mostly tasteless but I ate them anyway. I did let our waiter know about the rice and the tacos. He did take off 1/2 the price of price of the tacos. I'll probably be back but not to order the tacos.,3 star rating,Patrick A.

THIS LINE DOES NOT MOVE. 45 minutes and maybe 3 people were helped. We left empty-handed. I returned with my bf and this time, we wrote our name down AND stood in line. There were 3 pages of names ahead of us...THREE! 15 minutes passed and the take-out line barely moved...then, I heard it. ""Lisa for 2!"" Several parties ahead of us left because of the daunting list. Their loss! We tried several dishes: Rock crab - good amount of meat, fresh, and sweet! We were thoroughly impressed by this. Oysters rockefeller - large, plump oysters, but engulfed with their hollandaise, cheesy, herb-y sauce. Had to scrape a lot of the sauce off...it was overwhelming.Lobster bisque - creamy and flavorful! Fried calamari, oysters, scallops, and shrimp plate - everything was fresh and fried to perfection. scallops were my fave, although some pieces on the bottom started to get soggy.....from the grease. onion rings were underwhelming. Crispy and large rings, but lacks flavor/seasoning, the onions weren't sweet. However, the coleslaw was good and had some pop of sweetness with a few pieces of pineapple and raisins mixed in. Service was great, we sat at the bar and the guys were very attentive. It was quite a feast at an affordable price, esp more so with the groupon. TIPS: +  Get the local (rock) crab!+ Bring a jacket because it gets COLD and WINDY outside on the pier. When it comes to the wait, prepare for the worst, but hope for the best! haha+ buy the groupon if it's still available!",4 star rating,Lisa N.

Great to see a place take notice of the little things for their customers. Lobster roll was amazing big chunks of lobster very filling,5 star rating,Chris G.
11/18/2018,"Yorba Linda, CA","I love this spot on the SB pier.  You get in line and place your order and they call your name when your order is ready!  We had fun sharing a variety of seafood dishes such as crab cocktail (we didn't want to crack the shells that day), sea urchin, live oysters, clam chowder and onion rings!  Just be careful, the food is served on paper plates and it was a breezy day and our plates went FLYING!! We found pretty close parking and it was a beautiful walk to the pier.",4 star rating,Cynthia M.
6/16/2015,"Santa Monica, CA","I was recommended to this place from a coworker and I was a little skeptical with it being on a pier (you know how piers can be tourist traps)!We walked up, put our name on the list (there's no host - so make sure you do it otherwise you'll wait awhile). It was about a 15-20 minute wait, but we got there at 6pm because we heard of how long the wait could be - not bad for a Friday night.We sat down at the bar order a pitcher or beer and started with the ceviche. This was my least favorite part about the meal. It tasted very fresh, but really lacked flavor. But if you're going for quantity, this was a HUGE appetizer that could be split between four people.My mom and I ended up splitting the lobster tacos and the king crab. The king crab was fresh off the boat was was one of the best king crabs I've ever had. It isn't pre-cut to be prepared to get your hands dirty. Lobster tacos were good, but the next time I'm going there, I'm ordering a crab for myself. :)",5 star rating,Nichole K.
8/18/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.",5 star rating,Susan K.

7/5/2017,"Apex, NC","Husband and I were going to come here for a sit-down dinner inside the restaurant around 6:00 PM on a Sunday evening. It was pretty crowded as it was July 4th weekend. We had 10+ people ahead of us, so we ended up wandering around a bit. We saw the ""take-out"" line at the window, decided it was faster than sitting down, and crossed our name off the list.Oh and yes, it was a lot faster!! If you order from the take-out line, you get your food on a disposable plate and can just sit on the outdoor benches!! Shh. That was supposed to be a secret. Don't go crowding the take-out window now or you'll hold off all the restaurant orders.I got the onion rings and the scallop and shrimp pasta. The onion rings were incredibly greasy and not very good. The scallop and shrimp were fresh, but it was a pretty small portion. It didn't taste that great. Still a good place to visit if you want to eat at the wharf and follow my super secret tip to lessen the wait time.",3 star rating,Ellen S.

7/12/2015,"West Hollywood, CA","For the first time in my life I was drunk on crab. Yes, it's a thing because I just experienced it. This happens when none of your friends wants to share the special so you end up finishing claims, uni, a full plate of fries, lobster bisque and 3 lbs of rock crabs (1.5 crabs to be exact). You know that tipping point when you drink just enough and can still manage to be the perfect happy person? Well, I reached that point before the giant plate of crabs even landed in front of me. But they were absolutely delicious that I just couldn't stop myself from cleaning the plate. Get everything from the menu that you have the stomach for: claims, uni, rock crab special, lobster bisque and the rest that I will need another trip to try. The wait sounded intimidating at 1.5hr when we put our name down, but we were called in about 20mins because no one else on the list was around. All in the meanwhile, the takeout line we also stood in had barely budged.",4 star rating,Ang S.
7/12/2015,"Los Angeles, CA",The California king crab is why u would come here!! The flavor is pretty good and the rock crab is under $20 bucks...you really have to work for both of them though!! They do give you a pair of scissors that helps you crack the shell so makes it easier to extract the meat. The meat is super fresh so it comes out as a whole long piece of crab and it's the most rewarding feeling!! The clam chowder is really good as well!!,4 star rating,Larry C.

Little salt & pepper and that didn't help, I asked for a bit of butter & garlic Nd that helped but the lobster was overcooked and rubbery, very disappointed, this please is k own for fresh seafood but not today, I think this place is overrated and there are too many places that have better food for the price! My meal was Pprox. 19.00 and it was an Appetizer size, don't waste your money. I watched other food items go out and they were average, I have seen better food go out in many other places. 25 minutes after my meal I got extremely ill!

6/17/2015,"Seattle, WA","The selection of seafood on the menu at this place is impressive. It's a very popular spot, so I was surprised to see so little indoor and outdoor seating. With it being so windy at the pier, you don't want to get stranded with plates and napkins in your hands, and not having a place to sit. Speaking of the wind, watch your plates, napkins, condiment cups! They won't wave a goodbye before flying off...We got a Shrimp & Scallop Linguine, which was quite good, and a mixed deep-fried seafood platter. The fried shrimp and calamari were a tad overlooked, but scallops and oysters were cooked perfectly!  I also got half a dozen of raw oysters, and they were fresh and pleasant.",4 star rating,Volha A.
12/27/2015,"Dublin, OH","This is a tiny little restaurant with a gorgeous location. Right on the tip of the harbor in Santa Barbara. The view is fantastic. However, if you have a large party forget about seating inside the restaurant. It is super tiny and super busy. The outside seating was quite comfortable although a little windy in December. The service was a bit disorganized, with no one to acknowledge you when you arrive. We waited in line for a long time until we were told that for outdoor seating we could have just taken a table without putting our name on the list. The clam chowder soup bread bowl was good but not Boston quality good. Also, there was more bread than soup. I tasted the lobster bisque from my wife and it was mediocre (I'm being charitable here). The coconut shrimps were fine, no different than a million other places. All in all a disappointment but I suppose we should have tried the oysters. I just wasn't in the mood for them at lunch.",3 star rating,Ness S.
3/18/2015,"Irvine, CA","This was the perfect spot for me and my girls to have our last meal before heading back home from our mini-getaway.  SOOO glad we picked this place!Santa Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. We were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  The four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!We started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  For my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!My friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  Overall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)",5 star rating,Stacey K.

We ordered cup of clam chowder, uni with scallop, full lobster, side of onion rings, and clam pasta. Bill came out to under $100 (not including tip). I judge seafood restaurants by their clam chowder. I was not disappointed. Except... there was a hair in my soup. Which was a little gross, but the clam chowder was really good. Server was experienced and knowledgeable about the menu and seafood in general. Uni with scallop was soooo good. Very fresh and buttery. Clam pasta was perfectly al dente, but just a tad bland. Lobster was heavenly. It was cut in half and grilled just right. Came with 2 onion rings and some coleslaw on the side. This is not somewhere you want to wear your fancy clothes.

I also saw a crab trying to escape a tank. That was kind of sad, since I felt bad for him and admired his tenacity, but I was about to eat a crab, so my sympathy felt slightly hypocritical. The clam chowder was rich and filling, and the cioppino was filled with all kinds of different seafood. I thought the broth was a tad bit too wine-heavy (I know, right? That seems like it'd be a good thing), which made it acidic and sour. We also got the local special of the day, which was a rock crab. Man, those things have hard shells! It was fun getting out all the meat, and we only left with a few small cuts here and there on our fingers. Not only was the meal visually appealing, but it was tasty as well.

I came here on Valentine's Day, and the wait was definitely long. My boyfriend waited for about 45 minutes to an hour! I'm not sure what the wait is like any other day, but after seeing so many reviews here, we decided it would be worth the wait. The food here is a bit on the pricey side, but it is really good and the seafood is fresh. [[Clam Chowder]] Extremely smooth and creamy. It also has bacon in it, which is an added bonus because I love me some bacon! [[Scallop Ceviche]] Fresh, definitely. However, it wasn't anything amazing or out of this world, since it tasted like any other ceviche I've had before. Its served with a side of tortilla chips and some salsa. [[Lobster Tacos]] Absolutely delicious. There were huge chunks of lobster in the tacos, which I appreciate greatly. I've seen some restaurants skimp on the lobster when you're paying $15+ for the dish. It was served with rice (which was cooked perfectly, by the way), 2 slices of avocados, and their own chipotle sauce. All of these flavors just worked together harmoniously, and it was definitely a match made in food heaven. The waiters here are friendly, and they often check up on you to see how you're doing. It's quite easy for them to do this, as the place is on the smaller side, so they can really keep an eye on you (as creepy as that sounds. But you know what I mean).",4 star rating,Michelle T.

It's a small place in a good spot, so the wait was a little long (30 minutes). My complaint with this is you have to be within earshot of the restaurant when they yell your name for a table, you can't go and explore. I wish they had a way to call you or gave you pagers.  The service was spot on. She was very quick and attentive. I ordered the California king crab with lobster bisque and scallop ceviche.The lobster bisque wasn't super ""lobstery"" but was still really good. The ceviche was really good, but I wish the portion was a tad bit larger (less cabbage, more ceviche!). My mouth is watering right now thinking of it.

Would be difficult for large parties insideLobster Bisque- Was good but needed some salt and pepper. Local Rock Crab- Phenomenal. Steamed perfectly and didn't need any additions. Was a little messy to eat, but worth it. Fried Platter- They were out of oysters, but the scallops were good. The calamari was decent, but the shrimp was undercooked and tasteless. The onion rings, contrary to another review were perfectly crunchy and good. Oyster Rockefeller- The oysters were baked perfectly, but the sauce kind of overpowered them.

I arrived right before they opened the doors so there was no wait. I chose an outside table since it was a beautiful day. I ordered an uni shooter, which was delicious, and the fried oyster, shrimp, scallops and calamari plate. It came with 2 onion rings and a side of coleslaw. I have to say, the service wasn't great but I wasn't in a hurry so I didn't really care. The food came and the first thing I noticed was raisins in the coleslaw. I hate raisins but figured I could pick them out. No need to. The coleslaw had absolutely no flavor. I added salt and even some of the tartar sauce. Nope. Didn't help. The onion rings weren't much better. Absolutely no flavor. The only good thing I can say is they were crunchy but the batter didn't stick to the onion. Now we get to the seafood. It was obviously very over cooked especially the calamari. Like rubber. I could barely get my fork through the scallops. The oysters were more edible because they were bigger than everything else. I used the cocktail sauce on everything but when I tasted the seafood without the sauce, no flavor. Salt people!! Not sure if all of this was because they just opened for the day but if I was in the area again, I would chose a different restaurant.

5/16/2015,"Rowland Heights, CA","HIGHLY RECOMMEND the local rock crab special set ($24.95) that comes with 1 whole rock crab, salad and soup (clam chowder or seasonal bisque). The crab meat was sweet and tender, delicious even without any dip or lemon/lime juice. The KILL SHOT for me was that the rock crab came with 3 FAT CLAWS and we literally had mouthfuls of sweet crab meat.We replaced the salad with another soup so that we could taste both soups. The seasonal bisque for that day was lobster bisque (LUCKY) and my fiancé and I both agreed that the clam chowder tasted better than the lobster bisque. I personally hate dairy products or cheese or cream so if you're the same as me, rest assured that neither tasted like those (I asked for cheese on the side though).ALSO RECOMMEND the Shrimp and Scallop Pasta ($14.95). The proteins were fresh and cooked just right. The pasta was surprisingly chewy. The KILL SHOT was the broth cooked with garlic and white wine - we couldn't get enough of it! We even used the bread to absorb every last bit of the broth at the bottom of the plate.Finally, to me the least impressive dish was the crab cake ($13.95). It was listed as the first item under ""Favorites"" so we had high expectations. Turned out only average. I think the oil in the pan-fry process overpowered the sweet taste of crab meat.On a side note, we sat at the bar and saw the fried stuff just sitting there for hours. Looks like they briefly fry them first before officially frying them the second time when someone orders. That to me is not fresh at all, especially for seafood. As imagined, our onion rings came with thick and greasy coating. Would avoid their fried foods in general.Last but the least, the place had a strange smell coming from the kitchen. Killed the appetite a bit. But the staff were very nice and friendly.",4 star rating,Lo L.

We came around noon for lunch on a Sunday and the wait was an hour and a half for 4 ppl. They have a to go window, the menu is the same and you can sit outside on the pier. We opted for this option and still ended up waiting an hour to get our food. We got a lobster roll, their seafood stew in a bread bowl,  two pasta dishes that I am completely blanking out on and a crab. The only thing that was good was the crab. The lobster roll was dry, seasoning not so great. The pasta dishes tasted like butter with no flavor. The seafood stew was good and had a lot of seafood in there.

6/22/2015,"Sacramento, CA","Had a quick, but enjoyable experience here. Remember to put your name on the check-in list because the wait is usually long. (They do have a side window that you can order from and eat outside, I think). We were seated in about 30 minutes and were surprised by the layout. There's bar type seating wrapping around the edges with actual bar seating on the left. It was a little strange looking at a wall. There is the option of sitting at the tables outside, but the wait is usually a little longer for that. We ordered the Clam Chowder and the Shrimp Tacos. The chowder was good, but a little to creamy for personal taste. The shrimp in the tacos were cooked really well and the creamy salsa was delicious and added a lot of flavor. The service was typical for being in a beach shack, not too hands on, but not bad. One protip: park on the wharf itself to save some walking and some money since the restaurants do validate the hour or so.",4 star rating,Revati V.
4/10/2015,"Bakersfield, CA",Well I have to say that I was disappointed this time as the supply of crab was limited to the local Rock Crab and what they called California King Crab but my husband called Spider Crab.  There was barely enough in one crab for the two of us although it did taste good.  We both had clam chowder with our meal and onion rings.  The chowder was a little bland and the onion rings weren't quite as good as on our last visit.  We had a bottle of their house wine as well and our tab was over $77.  Wow!  I am not sure we would make a trip based on their food alone.,3 star rating,Pat B.

Our server was the handsome guy with blue eyes this time....very attentive and friendly.  This time we tried the oyster shooters, the cocktail sauce inside the shooter tasted amazing! Hint of spiciness and was just perfect. 1 oyster came inside, wouldve been mich better if there were at least 2 in there but it was delish. Tried the crab cake next, wasn't too crazy about this one, texture was a bit gluey, but good flavor, i've tried better crab cakes... Coleslaw was delish and onion ring was good and not greasy. Next was the steamed mussels, so delish and flavorful. Get it! And last we tried their linguine and clams...tasted good, very rich and creamy, i added salt pepper and lemon juice to it and it was fantastic. Overall i was impressed for the second time. I think they should put a fan inside tho, a bit hot inside for lunch time...",5 star rating,Angela L.

3/16/2017,"Arcadia, CA","No need to park on the street since parking on the Pier is free for the first 90 minutes then $2.50 for the first 30 min or 1hr afterwards.  Parking can be hard to find though since the pier is small. We had a table of 3 and had to wait around 45min to get seated at the bar.  Although the line was long, a lot of people were not there when they called out names.  There is a take out window on the side of the building and people can eat at the tables nearby. In addition to the regular menu, theres a specials menu inside the restaurantWith so much time to look at the menu while we waited we were ready to order when we got seated.  We first started with the clam chowder which had a spice that was overpowering of the soup but they do give a generous amount of ingredients.  Jonny, our server, recommended the shrimp and scallop pasta over the crab sandwich.  They give a decent portion of pasta, shrimp and scallops but the dish lacked flavor even with the side of cheese.Lobster roll - not like the lobster rolls I've had in LA or the E. coast with the large pieces of lobster.  Cioppino - great that it comes with the half portion of crab but I wish there was more soup in the inside of the bread bowl and soup could have been better.Live uni with scallop and lime - Best dish of the meal.  Didn't think the lime was needed but it was cool to watch the juice make the sea urchin move around when you put the juice on it.",2 star rating,Kenneth H.
12/15/2014,"Woodland Hills, CA","After spending the day in Carpinteria looking at the Seal Breeding area (and baby seals!!!), this place has my SEAL of approval! (Okay, I stole that one from someone - but it was just too good to pass up! Hahahaha!) Anyway, we were trying to figure out some place to eat and since we were so close to Santa Barbara, I was thinking how could we not go up and eat there! I originally wanted to try this pastrami place but they were closed on Sunday and being near the ocean, made me crave some seafood - and when my boyfriend suggested this place but wasn't sure I would like it (I'm typically not much of a seafood eater - although I'll do shellfish!), it sounded good! The last time I was in Santa Barbara, I was on the pier and I noticed this place. It was constantly crowded but at that time - I was too enamored with the tons of Pelicans on the pier! Anyway, I wanted to try this place out when he mentioned it and away we went! Anyway, this place is right on Sterns Wharf! It's this smallish, seafood shack type place! The inside is just basically made up of barstools but there are some tables outside by the side of the pier! It's modest inside but you have a great view of the ocean from the inside of the restaurant (and I guess outside too).Also, as far as service goes, we didn't have any sort of problem at all! We put our names on the list outside and were seated relatively quickly! Also, the server came and took our order quickly and refilled our drinks. We definitely didn't have any problems with that! I chose to have one of their specials - half a lobster with Caesar salad! It was absolutely delicious! It came with a little container of butter and the lobster was so delicious! Juicy! Fresh! Tasty! The Caesar salad was also good - it was a vinaigrette Caesar - and added a nice balance to the meal! Pump had the Alaskan crab! Honestly, it was even more sweet than my lobster! I thought it was so delicious! Especially with that butter sauce! But it looked hard to get out! All in all, I loved this place! The view was amazing and the food was so fresh and just plain delicious! It's not anything super fancy but it's great fresh shellfish! I would definitely come back!",5 star rating,Sam L.
5/12/2018,"Canoga Park, CA",Great food and great service!! I'm only giving 4 stars cause it's a restaurant by the ocean and they give you straws. I told our waiter we were straw less and when we got refills on water he forgot and got us straws. Straws should be on request or just have no straws for the animals safety. They can easily be blown into the ocean from the wind when kids are playing with the straws and drop them constantly on the floor. If the zoos are straw less for the animals so can the entire pier!!

1/31/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Alaskan King Crab legs were going for $36 a pound, I was sucker enough to get them and I'm glad I did. They were possibly some of the best king crab legs I've ever had in a long time. It was so worth the splurge. It's super casual and there's tons of seating everywhere both indoor and outdoor. To be seated indoor you had to put your name on the list. Outdoor seating is plenty available and there's a window to order from. The staff is friendly, they're all super attentive and nice. The only problem with sitting outdoor is the seagulls, they can leave the table tops filthy. Definitely need to come back here and try the lobster roll and clam chowder.The restaurant is located on the historic wharf which was used for industrial fishing and docking back in the day. It's pretty well maintained and very visitor friendly. You can walk, ride a bike or drive and park your car on the wharf, it's super relaxing and calm. Tips: Unfortunately they do not cook chicken, pork, beef or really anything besides seafood. So if you dislike seafood your choices are limited, they can basically leave out the seafood if you order a pasta. They take cash, credit and debit and there's an atm at one of the gift stores.",4 star rating,Trisha W.

Put our name down, but when we went around to the side to wait, noticed there was a to-go order window. There's lots of public picnic bench seating so we opted for the window, though there was a line there, too. Ordering and waiting for our food took over 30 min, but the view is nice so it was chill. I got the crab sandwich, which was simple and tasty, but the onion rings I got with it were the crunchiest ever. Yum! My friend got the cioppino, which comes in a bread bowl. Also tasty and overflowed with seafood, but really that's because they dug the smallest hole in the bread for the soup.All in all, it was ok and would go again.

There was a 20 minute wait but it was worth it! I had some the the best clam chowder that I have ever tasted. I also ordered the mussels which had a great taste in a light soup. They have some great brews on tap from SF that we tasted. I will try the crab on my next visit as it seemed like the crowd favorite. I highly recommend this restaurant.,5 star rating,Ryan W.

8/8/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is right on the pier. Probably one of the last piers on the West Coast that you can still drive your car on and find a parking spot. Coming back here recently reminded me of the visit to this restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside and certainly not a whole lot of space for tables on the inside. Before you even walk into this place, you can already smell the seafood food cooking in the salt air. With just a few guys behind the counter, you can still see all of the guys cooking and preparing everything to order. Put your name down and hope to be called for a table inside as it was a bit windy and chilly outside. The guy who took our order was still getting other orders together as he asks what we would like to order. We had already seen someone order the Cioppino so it is definitely a good item to go for. Once you order, it's now a waiting game just like when you just put your name down on the list. I really wanted to order the oysters but I think I would be the only one polishing those off before we tackle the huge bread bowl we ordered. With crab legs sticking out of the bread bowl, there comes an order of linguine and clams. Imagine these two huge dishes with a couple of draft beers, you gotta roll each other out of this place when you're done. Definitely one of the places to stop in when you walk by and there isn't a line. Still worth it for the wait because you know everything is fresh in this place. You cannot mistake that with the fresh live tanks behind the counter. I'm already getting hungry writing this story and want to drive up here to grab a seat.",4 star rating,Tim C.
6/1/2017,"Seattle, WA","SB Shellfish co is my favorite place in Santa Barbara to eat. Hands down. I love seafood, and the fewer frills the better. This place is solid, fresh seafood, prepared at it's best. I come here for special occasions, I bring SB visitors here, and sometimes I'll just order clam chowder at the window and eat outside on the wharf.I love their chowder, it's one of the few chowders that doesn't rely on bacon fat-- which many do. Why people why?? Bacon does not always make everything better!My favorite dish here is the cioppino!!!! to DIE for. All of the fresh seafood in a delicious tomato broth, served in a bread bowl. Although I have to admit, I often get it without the bread bowl so i can slurp up more broth. The oysters here are incredibly fresh, and delicious. The crab specials are abundant!! The baked little neck clams just melt in your mouth. The best appetizer, except for the oysters. Really, just get both. The lobster tacos are so yummy, so is the crab sandwich. These are my two lunch go-to options.Really, you can't go wrong-- unless you show up at peak times and there's no where to sit. (tip: you can get anything off the menu at the side window, then you can eat at the picnic table. No booze though...)It breaks my heart when I see people walk into Moby Dick's nearby. I often just want to yell at them and tell them to go to Shellfish instead... but then, they would crowd up my place even more. But, that's what they get for not doing their research, am I right?I don't like the cole slaw- but who is there for the cole slaw? (no one.)",5 star rating,Natasha B.

9/20/2018,"Hayward, CA","I was on a short roadtrip to Santa Barbara and after a bike ride along the beach I was hungry for seafood. I greeted by Jonny and was seated at the counter overlooking the open kitchen. I was looking at the oyster selection and Jonny gave me run down on the oysters they served. I ordered a half dozen oysters mixed variety.  They were very fresh and tasty along with a nice mignonette sauce and seafood sauce with a dollop of horseradish an addition of both a lime and lemon wedge. Looking over the menu and with the recommendation from Jonny I ordered their house Cioppino which was loaded with shellfish (king crab, mussels, clams,scallops, shrimp) in a very flavorful broth set inside a bread bowl. I barely finished the shellfish and could only finish some of the bread that soaked in the great broth.Jonny was very helpful, courteous and very alert to the needs of his guests.

But it's own fresh flavor is good enough. We also got the lobster tacos, which were also amazing! The smoky flavor of the lobster as well as the taco tortilla, really a good combination.Portions are big, so no worries of not getting full. Price is really reasonable.

They don't care.In terms of food, everything was overly salty, esp the clam chowder and crab bisque, the bisque also contains some flour clumps and was really yucky. The oyster didn't tasted fresh. The lobster roll was meh... only edible stuff was the whole lobster. There was no uni which was what we came for. This lunch costs us $90. Bad decision to eat at touristy spot anyways.

We were seated inside at the bar/kitchen front. I had no idea how small this place was until we walked in! The service was GREAT and the food even better. Our waiter (who looked like Jake Ballard from Scandal, which was definitely a plus) was SO awesome and so friendly. He made us feel at home and was very attentive but not in an annoying/excessive way at all. The food was delicious-- we ordered oysters on the half shell (daily selection), shrimp and scallops pasta, and a crab sandwich. Everything was great and tasted very fresh and flavorful. It was cool sitting at the bar/kitchen front and watching them prepare our meals as well.

The guts were super sweet and tasteful. (They have live seafood in tanks and cook it right in front of you, so you definitely know they were fresh. Plus, it was a new shipment of crab!)Fresh uni- 4 stars; the uni was creamy and sweet; however, the thing i did not like was the overpowering lime taste that the scallop and uni was placed upon. Way too overpowering to fully enjoy the uni. Oysters- 4 stars; delicious and fresh! There were two kinds on the menu and tried both. Overall, delicious food and highly recommend it.

7/17/2019,"Santa Maria, CA","I truly don't see what the big deal is about this place. As a local, I'd categorize it as a tourist trap. I've been 3 times and every time was disappointing. They don't do reservations, and since it is apparently ""all the rage"" to everyone else, be prepared to wait around for a table for 45 minutes at the very least. First visit, I got the shrimp/scallops pasta--very bland, second visit I got the cioppino--there was more bread than anything else, it ended up soaking up most of the broth and made the bread disgustingly soggy, so couldn't eat that even. Couldn't remember what type of seafood they put in it, so obviously it wasn't memorable. Thought third time would be a charm; ordered box crab, and the darn thing was FILLED with water just dripping out all over the place and the meat itself was super stringy--not the type of texture a crab should be. And the prices are ridiculous for the amount and quality you get.

The rock crab was delicious and generously portioned (I think it was $30 for 2 crabs or something... can't remember). What I did not like:1. They ran out of uni by 1pm... Hello?? Isn't Santa Barbara KNOWN for their uni? If you ask me, that's poor inventory planning.2. The inside of the restaurant smells AWFUL. Sure, this is a seafood restaurant so I wasn't expecting it to smell like a bakery... but the whole restaurant smelled sour and musty, like a dirty wet mop that's been collecting cultures of bacteria.3. There are only 4 tables outside and it's far away from the sun, so it's cold, windy, and dark (even if it's a sunny hot day)4. Waiting 1-1.5 hours for an outside tableRecommendations:1. Do NOT sit inside, unless you plan on breathing out of your mouth the entire time2. Bring a jacket if you plan on sitting outside3.

I got the rock crab which is a local crab 3 lbs for $28.95 it was simply amazing, I would say the best crab I've ever had, and we've been around the world. My wife ordered the lobster roll for $18.95 albeit the Maine lobster was good, not great, the overall seasoning left a lot to be desired, we will stick to the east coast for lobster rolls!!

5/31/2014,"Fremont, CA","I really don't understand how this place has such high reviews...I came here last week with my mom, and we were so disappointed. It was her first time in SB so I wanted to take her somewhere that was SB-esque. I thought what is more SB than fresh seafood? We came here around1:30 on a Thursday and had to wait about 30 minutes. We opted for their 3lb Rock Crab Special l with their Lobster BIsque and Caesar salad and Combination Seafood Platter. Here's a breakdown of what we thought:- Rock Crab: SO. DIFFICULT. TO. EAT! I am a seafood connoisseur and I know how to eat crab, but this crab was so difficult to crack (even with a crab cracker). In fact, I even cut myself during the process. Not only that, there was such little meat in each one that we were still hungry after the meal. All the weight came from their shells. And what made it worse is the server didn't even warn us, but warned the other couples next to us who happened to be Caucasian (coincidence??).- Lobster Bisque: good, but tastes NOTHING like lobster. It was basically a tomato bisque with not one piece of lobster in it. - Caesar Salad: good, but you can't really mess up Caesar salad.- Seafood Platter: everything was over fried. The calamari, oyster, and shrimp were tough and chewy, not pleasant. The only thing that was delicious was the scallop. They even messed up onion rings! Howw?! Their service wasn't up to par either. Every server gave so much attention to this couple that were regulars but didn't give half the amount of attention to the rest of their customers. I'm all for appreciating your regulars, but if you don't provide great service to new customers, how do you expect them to return? Our waitress in particular was unpleasant. She was not friendly at all and the only time she gave us a smile was when she handed us the bill. Overall, I would never come back. The special seems like a great deal, but for the price you pay and the amount of crab meat you get, it's not worth it. The seafood platter? Forget about it, you can probably get better at a chain like Red Lobster or Elephant Bar. Save your time and money and just avoid this place.",2 star rating,Jamie A.

1/13/2017,"Huntington Beach, CA","We chose this restaurant because of the Groupon being offered and the need for a seafood meal. The restaurant is located on the Santa Barbara warf and there is 90min free parking on the warf or on the street. It's at the end of the pier and has a nice view of the water. The seating is very limited and the wait time is first come first serve off a wait list and people will have to wait for the bar seating inside or for one of the four tables outside. It is worth the wait and if you go in-between lunch and dinner hours, there is hardly a wait. We waited about 10min for seats inside and this was around 3pm on a Friday. We ordered $50 worth of food using our Groupon and we're pleased with most of it all. The ceasar salad was amazing and the dressing tasted home made and fresh. The clam chowder was made with BACON and tasted better than any I've ever had anywhere. The coconut shrimp was divine and the sauce it came with was very sweet and yummy.The crab cakes were alright but the creamy sauce that came with the crab cakes was outstanding and I used it on everything i loved it so much I even dipped my onion ring in it. The calamari pasta was the only thing we both didn't care much for. I don't know what we expected but it just wasn't our favorite seafood dish nor did we love it like the rest of our order. Overall the service was great and the guy who waited on everyone was quick and kind and he worked hard. The outside waitress was also good and she cleaned all the tables very quickly even though it was 3pm and not many were waiting for them. The bathroom was much cleaner than I expected considering there was only one and it was frequented often by the customers.

Pineapple coslaw was a little too sweet for me. I judged on the whole plate, but if it was just the lobster roll, probably 4/5. My friend had the clam chowder and said that the sourdough bread was stale. Also said the one from Splash in Pismo is better. Location is definitely great tho. Nice view cuz it's right on the pier.

I love fried foods. If you sit at the bar they have built in purse hooks which is very helpful. They even have a take-out window! Enjoy good seafood here at the end of the pier!

3/28/2017,"Meridian, ID",LOVED this place! Very small-time reservation/seating. You write your name on a clipboard and they call you when something becomes available. We sat at the bar within 15 min on a busy night. The food was all caught that day. So fresh. So good. We chose the sea urchin from the tank as well as the fresh crab. We had beers and wine. Will visit this place every single time we're in town!,5 star rating,Melanie S.

8/3/2018,"Miami, FL","I've tried 2 things on the menu here. The abalone and the urchin. First time for both. Abalone is very chewy, sorta like calamari. Once you get over the texture, the sauce on this makes the dish. The urchin on the other hand was disgusting. I love all seafood/sushi you name it and this is the only thing I will never eat again. Why is it so expensive?? It literally was dissolving in my hand before I even put it in my mouth. Was very disappointed after reading the reviews on here. Must not be for everyone. I'm sure there are some other great things here but given that it's on the wharf, everything is expensive. But if I ever go back, I'd continue getting takeout from the outdoor window to eat on the picnic tables outside. Great view of the mountains/palm trees. And that avoids the wait to get a seat inside.",3 star rating,Brianna I.

Bonus surprise addition of a few huge onion rings that came with it. - Crab cocktail: half of a tall paper cup full of fresh crab meat topped with avocado. My friends couldn't get enough of it.- Large menu: from fried items to full crabs and lobster - To go window: can order without waiting for a table inside and eat it on the picnic benches overlooking the waterLowlights:- No alcohol from the window: a glass of wine would've been nice to complete the experience - Nothing for the non-seafood eater: nice to have something for the hubEnjoyed a pre-lil toot boat ride snack here and will return for a full meal now that I know how good it is.",5 star rating,Eve K.
4/21/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","There is an abundance of fresh seafood options in Santa Barbara. My gf and I like SB Seafood Co. because the food is fresh, the atmosphere is awesome, views of the harbor are excellent, and the service is friendly.Seating inside and outside are a bit scarce, but if you are lucky enough to get one of the 4 outdoor tables, you will have an amazing view of the harbor and pier. Daily specials vary. We went big for dinner last time ordering Maine lobster and Alaskan king crab.This time around for lunch we tried to order light. We started with the lobster bisque and a couple of oyster shooters.The bisque was pretty amazing. The shooters were on par w/ Brophy's which were very tasty.For the main event I ordered maine lobster roll. Pretty bomb...loaded w/ lobster meat I split it with my gf. It came with onion rings and cole slaw. My gf ordered the fried oysters, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. Pretty delicious. The calamari were a little over cooked and chewy though. The rest were well executed.Santa Barbara Seafood Co. is a nice option on the pier, and is definitely a nice spot to grab good eats when a seafood craving is in order!",4 star rating,Niccolo L.

3/9/2017,"Phoenix, AZ","Located right on the end of the warf, this little seafood shack was very conveniently placed for us to dine at. Side note: Parking on the warf is free for the first 90 minutes. Even though there was a line to get into the restaurant, we still made it out with free parking! When you get there, you put your name and number in your party on a clipboard hanging on the door. It didn't take more than 10 minutes to be seated with an ocean view. We received great service. I created my own pasta, even though that wasn't an option on the menu. The only reason I took off one star is because the lobster in my pasta was a bit dry, with no big pieces. Also, the sauce on the pasta was a little lack-luster. But the scallops and shrimp were succulent and well cooked. Overall, we enjoyed dining here. I would come back and try something else for sure.",4 star rating,Ana G.

The long was line and we did wait a long time but once we ordered the food didn't take as long as I thought. It's pricey but it's seafood and worth it!! We ordered the lobster sandwich, calm chowder, and a side of onion rings. The lobster sandwich was AMAZING!! They look small but trust me it's loaded with a ton of lobster and was super filling. The clam chowder was good, as well as the onion rings. But the lobster sandwich is a must try!!!!",4 star rating,Jeanette S.

4/21/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","$25 for a huge 3 pound Rock Crab, Soup & Salad (I chose clam chowder and caesar salad). The clam chowder that real clam bits in it, chunky potatoes, and the caesar salad wasn't too creamy so it balanced out. The Rock Crab comes with two pieces of onion rings, 2 lemon wedges, butter, and cocktail sauce. I'd hate to admit that I ate the entire thing by myself including the soup and salad but I did, and I was stuffed. For HOURS.  There were some tough parts in the crab but mostly it was good, soft meat. We came around 3pm and that seemed to be the perfect time for a short wait. We got a nice outdoor seat overlooking the pier. By around 5pm, when we were done eating, the line was outrageously long and only getting longer. Pretty great deal with a good view. Husband got the coconut shrimp that came with coleslaw and onion rings and he was really happy that the coconut tasted so real.",4 star rating,Jin Y.
7/30/2019,"Lakewood, CA","This was not a good seafood experience for me! I took my young son who loves sea food here specifically for crab. The waiter who btw was very cordial suggested the box crab. Not only was it pricey but both my son and I agreed it lacked in flavor. I thought I would score higher with my order of crab cakes but boy was I wrong!The cakes started ok, but the more I ate them, the less I liked them. Even my son's little friend complained that his grill cheese sandwich was tasteless. Maybe I need to return to try some other dishes, but at this point I am not convinced that this place is a good recommendation for great seafood. Overated and overpriced!",3 star rating,Cassandra W.

Indoor seating was more available, but I enjoyed sitting under the heaters, where the tables faced the sunset view of the harbor boats. The California King Crab was a feast! The table shears cut easily through its soft shell, revealing tasty sweet crab meat. The guys who work there, Ever, Paul, and Antonio, were cheerful with guests, making the wait more pleasant. Antonio playfully presented my King Crab with a drumroll! Thanks for a fabulous dining experience!",5 star rating,Kelsey B.

Here in Santa Barbara, it does not get any fresher. Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it.

Thought I would ask her the difference in crabs, sweet/salty, kind of thought I would get some basic answer, she went into detail about the regions they were from and their migration patterns due to weather, etc. Very interesting and showed she knew her stuff.

But there was no reason to fry a pile of onion rings, a few of which you get with every dish, and leave them lukewarm on the deep fryer.  And then have the cook grab a few of those cold lifeless rings with his bare hands and throw it on top of your food.  Which you get to witness as the fryer is directly across from the bar.  The rest of the food and service would have merited three star. And the beer was good. And yes,when I complained they gave me freshly fried onion rings.  But still!",2 star rating,Ira B.
6/1/2014,"Cupertino, CA","Somewhat of a tourist attraction, this place is somehow always where I end up when I visit. While it's definitely part of the Santa Barbara experience, the food is not exactly exceptional. Eating a whole crab, struggling with the plier-like tools, scraping out little bits like I'm starving, was an interesting adventure, but once was enough. The second time I went, I had the clam chowder after reading all the rave reviews about it.... wow was I disspointed! It was super salty and way to thick (like dripping off a spoon it was of liquidy mashed potato consistency), I couldn't go on. I ate my friend's fried oysters instead, which were delicious! Crisp on the outside, with a squishy juicy interior-- I had never had them before but they were awesome. (They came on a plate with choice of 3 fried sea creatures). Can't go wrong with fried stuff.to avoid the wait for seating inside, grab food at the outdoor register on a warm day so you can eat it wherever in the dock!",3 star rating,Sharon H.

9/14/2017,"San Ramon, CA","Okay food with a pretty high price point. I came during Labor Day weekend so I expected the long wait, so that's not what made me give 3 stars. I ordered the cioppino, crab cocktail, and the calamari appetizer. My fave dish was definitely the calamari because it was so crispy and tasty! The crab cocktail was pretty disappointing because there was very little crab on top of a full cup of cabbage with very little cocktail sauce. I think I definitely would have enjoyed the shrimp cocktail better. In my opinion, the cioppino wasn't reduced enough because it still had a prominent wine taste that wasn't the most pleasant. The cioppino was full of uncracked crab, scallops, mussels, and clams. The scallops were 100% my favorite part of the dish! I wish the crab was pre-cracked or if they gave us a cracker because mid meal we had to go back up to the window and ask for a cracker. The bread bowl unfortunately soaked up a lot of the broth so I it started to fall apart and make a mess on the tray. But nonetheless the bread soaked in the soup was pretty tasty. A pretty cool place at the end of the pier that you should try at least once. I'm glad I checked this place out, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",3 star rating,Hillary C.

2/17/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","The view is spectacular.  Santa Barbara Shellfish Company is located at the end of Stearn's Wharf.  You're allowed to self park on the pier (If you can find parking) or valet your car for free for 90 minutes (no validation needed).  I ate here Monday for lunch and it was such a beautiful day!  Given that it was President's Day, the restaurant was already busy by 11:30 am.  We waited an hour to be sat and were lucky enough to snag a 4-top table on the pier.  Inside, the restaurant is small and cramped.  Too much hustle and bustle going on to really enjoy your meal if you were to dine in the inside.  There is only one unisex restroom.  If you really have to go, there is a separate public restroom facility on the pier. Onto the food.. we tried ordering the local urchin and rock crab but both were already sold out.  We settled on the lobster tacos, a dozen kusshi and kumamoto oysters, and the dungeness with a garden salad.  I think.. this place was overhyped and over priced.  The food was honestly mediocre at best.  The best part were the oysters but that's standard at any restaurant where you order kusshi and kumamoto.. only these bad boys cost about $40mp total.  The dungeness crab also cost about $40+ but you can go to an Asian market like 99 Ranch and get the same quality for $20.I really wanted to like this restaurant.  The view compensates for the average tasting food.  I would only come back to try the urchin and enjoy the view.",3 star rating,Krystle C.

8/18/2015,"Brooklyn, NY","Good luck getting a seat here because I don't know anyone who did. There's an indoor and outdoor seating and you can select where you want to eat. However, because no one ever seemed to be called in for a seat, I went the take out way and ate in the public eating area. Everyone else had the same idea. About an hour later, I checked the list and it looks like no one ever got seated. After getting the food, I can tell you that I was pretty disappointed. I came to this place reading great reviews on yelp and seeing how this place was the only place with a line, I thought it must be good and popular. Overall I would say it was pretty bland. I got the abalone daily special, stone crab (came with salad, soup, and onion ring)[because the California and spider crab were out despite being on the special), clams, and a fried (oyster, scallop, shrimp) combo (came with cole slaw and onion rings). Out of all of these, I only found the fried scallop and clams to be good. Cole slaw was definitely bad, onion ring batter was just plain, and crabs weren't anything special (not to mention they scrapped off the eggs at the head which I like to eat). Definitely not worth the money I paid for it. 4 stars is really generous. Not sure if 3 stars are either.",3 star rating,Diana T.
10/21/2017,"Ventura, CA","It was really a disappointing experience especially after waiting for an hour to get seated at an outside table. We ordered 2 cups of clam chowders, a ceasar salad with grilled shrimps, calamari pasta, and shrimp tacos for a party of 3 and 1/2First of all, the chowders were luke warm, not hot. Tasted ok. The ceasar salad came with not fresh looking rusty lettuce and such tiny shrimps on a skewer. The shrimps were over grilled and tasted bitter. My husband said his calamari pasta lacked flavors, and he needed to add some salt and peppers. My friend said her shrimp tacos had small shrimps and also tasted like anything special. The service was just ok. Our waiter looked pretty busy, and I had no chance to give him the feedbacks of the dishes we had. Overall, it seemed really touristy and over rated somehow.

3/3/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","This is my absolute favorite place to eat in Santa Barbara when I visit. There's always a fairly long wait, but it's beautiful out on the pier while you're waiting to be seated. It's very small inside and best for groups of only 2-3 people. The seafood is extremely fresh and seasoned to perfection. I've tried the crab cakes, lobster pasta, Cioppino, shrimp and lobster tacos, Dungeness crab, and the shrimp scampi on different visits. All of these dishes have been fantastic and we always recommend this place to anyone traveling to the area. Usually food on a pier in Southern California isn't the best, but this place is 100% the exception to that rule!",5 star rating,Christine S.
3/12/2017,"Richmond, CA",I Really recommend the oyster shoots they were yummy I also  ate a crab sandwich it was OK I'm from sf and I think the one at the pier in sf is better . Service was good even tho they are crazy busy .. the only bad think is that you can't drink  a beer  on the outside tables other then that everything WAS perfect,4 star rating,Nestor G.
1/4/2019,"Highland Park, IL","Yes, the view is wonderful. Yes the food is delicious. But at what price? I watched them take a crab out of an overcrowded tank, then smash it with a mallet without first chilling (desensitizing) it. The legs were thrashing like crazy as it tried to get away. I am not a vegetarian; I believe humans are designed to eat meat. But that food must be treated HUMANELY. I could never eat here again.",1 star rating,Sue T.
6/4/2016,"CA, CA","What a fantastic place to dine. My husband and I loved our waiter, John P.  John recommended the Cioppino which comes in a sour dough bowl and my husband ordered the 2-1/2 pound local King Crab. Both entrees were the best we've ever had. The Cioppino had just the right amount of kick and the Crab was fresh. Oh, I can't forget about the clam chowder which came with the Crab. Wow, was that great. They are so nice there, even the cooks asked how our dinner was. We got lucky, we arrived at about 8:30 and waited less than 5 minutes. What a nice surprise in comparison to some of the other reviews. HIGHLY recommend. Really made our trip to Santa Barbara complete.",5 star rating,Liz R.

The shrimp tacos were bland along with the spanish rice it came with, and the bisque was ok along with the crab, but again definitely not worth the price.

So we opted to order at the outside counter and embrace the cold, winter night.I got the clam chowder bread bowl and the crab cakes. Let's start with the good, the crab cakes. They served two crab cakes, crispy and flavorful. Not too much breading, but small.The clam chowder bread bowl was quite disappointing. First, the soup was not hot. It was luke warm, which quickly turned to cold while we were sitting outside. Second, the bread bowl sucked! It was cold, not warmed or toasted, and stale. The best part of the a sourdough bread bowl is the crispy exterior of the sourdough bread! This completely lacked.My friend seemed to enjoy her medium size crab though...",2 star rating,Qui C.

We all order a bowl of clam chowder in a bread bowl. It was really disappointing.It was really bland.They didn't take much of the bread out so it was a really small serving if actual chowder.It didn't taste like clams, I think it needs more cream, and they really should have taken out more bread. I felt jipped and disappointed.I had a better clam chowder that weekend but won't say where.Maybe this is more traditional and ""pure"" but it still should have been more flavorful. That is the bottom line.Kudos to the nice gentlemen serving us though. He was really awesome. He handled the packed place like a champ.Edit.That's the word I was poking for!

3/10/2014,"Sparta, NJ","This was the second time for me, and it was even better than I remembered from trip number one 6 years ago. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. No big deal when there's the pier to walk around. Scoring a table in the warm sun on a cool day was really nice.  Our server was very attentive and knew the menu well. I was happy that there were plenty of abalones in the tank because I've wanted to eat one or four or those suckers for years ever since seeing a show where some dude pulled some out of a cage from under a pier and cooked them up right there. They were awesome! The ride they were served with was great and fresh tasting with good parsley and tomatoes with some taste. Lobster tacos served with an avocado cream were fantastic. And the coconut shrimp served with a blood orange sauce were the best I ever had - and I don't like coconut shrimp because it's usually way too sweet.  This was not. This place has a really laid back vibe. Right at the end of the touristy pier, this place has a feeling of no cheesiness compared to those places closer to the shore. Great food surrounded by the sea with tanks stocked with ginormous crabs was a great part of our Santa Barbara time.",5 star rating,Mike M.

12/15/2013,"West Los Angeles, CA","With glowing reviews, it was a must for us and we definitely weren't disappointed. The place looks just as cozy on the inside as it does from the outside. With limited seating available, we had a short wait before we were guided to seats at the counter looking onto the stove top and kitchen. You wont find any tables inside but instead, counter space running the length of walls. Although, table seating is available outside. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the giant tank full of crabs! I felt kind of bad for the little guys but it's the same setup they have in the Chinese grocery markets I grew up with.Hung over the stove and grill, you'll find a chalkboard with the day's specials. You have a choice of several types of crabs including Dungeness, King Crab and Rock Crab. We decided on the 3 lb. Rock Crab and the 1.5 lb local Spiny Lobster as recommended. We also had to try the clam chowder, lobster bisque... and of course some oysters.Planted at the counter, we watched the chefs serve plate after plate of shellfish as well as seafood pastas, sandwiches and tacos. Served with sides of drawn butter and cocktail sauce the lobster and crab were fantastic; firm flesh and with a clean taste. In general I have a personal preference for crab over lobster and in this case holds true. Although it's a bit more work to extract the meat, I find the flavors of crab meat to be more savory. Along with your shellfish you're handed a pair of seafood crackers, bowls for the shells, and wet naps. Have at it! Put your modesty aside here.Both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder were mouthwatering. I wouldn't say it's the best chowder I've had, but it's definitely up there in the ranks. The top spots for chowder in my books are still held by Old Fisherman's Grotto out in Monterey or Blue Water Seafood Market and Grill in San Diego. Here you'll find large chunks of clams in the chowder with a buttery texture. The lobster bisque was surprisingly tasty as well. The cup of soup was the perfect serving size as bisques are very creamy and rich.The options for oysters are hung inside the restaurant. For the day we had the choice between Blue Point Oysters from Long Island, New York and  Morro Bay Oysters from San Luis Obispo, California. We decided to go with a half dozen Morro Bay. Freshly shucked and chilled, they were served with a side of cocktail sauce and horseradish.  The Morro Bay Oysters are a bit larger and creamier than the Kusshi or Kumamoto's that are more well known.I'd say it satisfied my hankering for shellfish for a while. It doesn't get any fresher than this!",5 star rating,Wendy A.

8/16/2014,"Boston, MA","Went here while on Vacation as it was across the street from the hotel and had a delectable dining experience. First off we came here around 8pm so we did not experience  a wait, we were even able to get a table outside so we could watch the sun set; it was perfect. I have also never had crab before in my life so this was certainly the place to try it. We first started off with some Oyster shooters. It was a bit more on the cocktail sauce side of things so I didn't really taste the lemon or other flavors but still pretty good.Moved on to some Garlic Baked Clams. WHOA that was tasty. The garlic and Parmesan are a nice touch to the clam and pulled it all together. Also had some Oysters on the Half Shell and that was just a plain good ol' go to. Nothing special other than they were fresh.For a main course I ordered the Cioppino ( it was my first time eating crab so I needed to be eased into it). WOW I wish I had some right now. The crab was nice and tender and really buttery but also a bit spicy as the sauce seeped into the shell and it added a nice flavor. Everything was just amazing. I wasn't really sure what to expect and man oh man this hit the spot. I'm glad I had to walk back to the hotel as I ate everything and then needed to work it off. I do NOT recommend wearing jeans if you want to try everything on the menu, as they will be way to tight because you will literally eat every last crumb.",4 star rating,Marie H.

We sat inside had a cold beer and ordered calamari, shrimp, oysters and scallops for $12.95 and the lobster roll @ $18.95. I had visions in my head of nice chunks of sweet lobster dressed up a bit on a soft roll. I did get the soft roll, but in it was a minced orange glop that tasted kind of odd...not much like lobster at all.

Dipping the clam juice with the stale bread was excellent especially the bread soaked up all the juice.  So tasty.  My fiance was making fun of me kept dipping the bread into the juice!I've never had Dungeness Louie and the dish was very good!  The crab was so sweet and very generous chunks of it!There was a French couple who sat down next to us saw we had the chowder in bread bowl and ordered that.  When they saw us dipping the bread with the clam juice and enjoying it alot.  They went ahead and ordered the same thing.  I could hear them go ""hmm...hm...nom nom nom"".  I guess they approved the place too!",4 star rating,Abbe W.
8/19/2013,"Mountain View, CA","I'm pretty sure this place got 4 stars and about 500 reviews largely because it's a gigantic tourist trap at the end of the pier in Santa Barbara.I came with a group of four and let it be known that a group bigger than two would make you feel pretty claustrophobic because they actually only have bar like seating here since it's such a tiny restaurant. I think the small quarters steam coming from the open kitchen made this entire place feel really muggy and humid which, I wasn't a fan of.In terms of food, we ordered their clam chowder, fried oysters and lobster tacos. The clam chowder had a TON of corn starch and I was really not impressed by the taste. I'm surprised it was talked about so much on the reviews. I'm not a fan of oysters so, I won't comment on that but, the lobster tacos were sub-par for $18. It came with a small amount of lobster meat on top of a giant slaw of cabbage. The cabbage to lobster ratio really killed it for me since I couldn't taste anything but the greens. I don't think it's worth the price.I would say I've had much better food elsewhere but, the service was good so, I won't give it one star but, I think there are better selections in SB.",2 star rating,Stephanie L.

5/10/2014,"Chicago, IL","Here for a wedding in the area and stopped over in Santa Barbara for some wine tasting and beach. We looked this place up online ahead of time and thought it was unique being at the end of the pier. We headed to the restaurant after trying out a few tasting rooms. Note, they do not accept reservations and are busy. It's a tiny indoor outdoor space. Their system is write your name on a sheet of paper at the front. If your luck, someone is there to tell you the length of a wait. What you don't know, are the people who are no shows due to the wait but their names are still on the list. It could be a short wait, but also pretty long, specially for an outdoor seat. Do what we did, if the line is short, order from the walk-up take-out window. I thought it was lovely and perfect for a wharf.  While in line you get to view the lobsters and giant crab in their tanks. View a menu as you wait so you're ready when you get to the window. They are in a hurry!  Order your grub, stake out a nearby picnic table and listen intently for them to holler your name. I love the whole action of it all. I would like to dine at the actual restaurant some day, but this was still fun!We ordered the lobster bisque bread bowl, super yum, think and creamy. I ordered the lobster tacos. Holey lobster! They made sure it was lobster filled I wish there was more sauce or filling than what was provided. It's more food than you can finish with the rice included. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes. We also ordered an extra order of onion rings (even though the crab cakes come with some). We were not able to finish our extra order of onion rings.

5/29/2018,"Saratoga, CA","This review is mostly about my friends' dishes and the general impressions I got more so than my own personal taste.So for starters - I ordered the lobster roll. The dish was not to my liking, but that's because I'm not a fan of celery in lobster rolls. The celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish. I also found the lobster overdressed. But some of this is just a matter of taste so I won't ding them hard for that.The rest of the food, given the price, was fantastic. The crab and lobster were all fresh, all cooked correctly, and all at a price that worked. It is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood. Most are either way too expensive or way too sucky.

It's that good. I cannot begin to describe the buffet of food that we had, and yet there was so much more to be had. Crab, oysters, clam chowder, rice, salad, etc. So fresh, so tasty, so mouth watering. We sat at the bar and the guy who served us was attentive and friendly. He explained all of the different types of crabs (they had a lot) and even pushed an extra bowl of soup our way. There's an array of tasty cold local beers on tap to wash it down. This place is located at the end of the pier in the middle of SB. While it may look like a tourist trap and undoubtedly attracts more tourists than locals, it felt authentic and the food was unpretentious, reasonably priced and mouth watering.",5 star rating,Rebecca S.
4/26/2016,"Dallas, TX","Small but very cozy little spot. My co-worker and I stopped by here for lunch on a business trip and were starving. I ordered a cup of seasonal bisque soup with a salad and the lobster tacos. Excellent choice. Lots of flavor and delicious. It helped that we were starving too. I would have tried everything on the menu. It was windy when we went and a bit too cold for people to sit outside, so we sat at one of the exterior tables/counters overlooking the wharf. Great good and great atmosphere...would be happy to come back again if and when I'm back in the area.",5 star rating,Derrick C.
12/26/2015,"London, United Kingdom","We came here on our last night in Santa Barbara in early November and it was the best place we ate in during our four nights there. It is a rather small place right on Santa Monica Pier and we were told by others that we should expect to wait for places. I guess we must have lucked out that Tuesday night because we got seats at the bar straight away. Perhaps it's because we don't mind counter seats as that means you can see all the action taking place in the kitchen - although I guess that also means you get the smell of food all over your clothes, but we don't mind.Anyway, our server was very friendly and enthusiastic - quite different from servers in the UK and Asia, I find - and it was clear that there were a few touristy regulars in, if you get what I mean. I had the cioppino (seafood stew served in a bread bowl) which was truly excellent, and my companion had scrumptious lobster tacos. We shared the onion rings. Even though we can usually eat a fair bit, that was enough for the two of us.If you walk around the outside of the restaurant, you can see the fish tanks in which the seafood is kept. Yes, you get to see what will soon become someone's meal, so you can tell the seafood is truly fresh.",5 star rating,Dominique L.

4/12/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Another great find because of Yelp. 4.5 stars definitely. The food came out super quick, the service was fast and friendly, and everything tasted very fresh. We started with the lobster bisque in a bread bowl. I wish the bread had been a bit more moist or fluffy and also warm. It was very cold and so the butter pad that they give you was not really going to work well. The bisque itself was very rich and tasty - almost sweet, so it could have used a bit more of a savory edge, but overall we devoured it. I tried the shrimp tacos. They are served over a large bed of Spanish rice. The rice was amazing - perfectly cooked and seasoned. The tacos also come with a couple of avocado slivers and a wonderful creamy sauce. The shrimp were well-portioned and the tortillas were soft, pliable and tasty. Loved it. The hubs got one of their combo plates with battered shrimp, scallops, oysters and calamari as well as some coleslaw and onion rings. He devoured that too. We were also able to order a beer while we waited as long as we stayed in their outside roped area.When you arrive you put your name down on a clipboard and you can sit inside, outside or wherever first availability is. We chose inside because it was a bit chilly. Inside you are at a counter, so it was hard to maneuver my big huge handbag! Ha. But other than that it was surprisingly cozy and comfy. They bring out your food quick, so it isn't the type of place that you can hang out in a whole lot, unless maybe you sit at the bar which is a bit better suited for that. They have about 4 outside tables with benches that face the ocean, which is really nice. They also have a window that you can walk up to on the side of the building and you can order and then sit yourself on one of the picnic style tables they have on the other side of the pier (other side from where they have their own sit down seating). No waitress service if you order from their side window though. Parking on the pier is free for the first 90 minutes, but make sure you bring your ticket for validation (we totally missed that).",4 star rating,Adriana M.

The 2lb local crab, garnished with onion rings is the best shell fish deal in Santa Barbara, or anywhere else for that matter. The crab is sweet and delicious and I actually found I prefer it to its more expensive snow and king brothers. At just $22 it can not be beat. The service is excellent, our waitress even brought over a live abalone to keep our fussy 2 year old occupied while we ate. She loved it. My only complaint is that the stools for the bar style seating are a bit uncomfortable for those of us under 6 feet tall.

Right in our faces which made ordering even more confusing for the guy who was flirting! then he didn't give us a receipt. So when we got our food and explained that wasn't what we ordered he shrugged his shoulders and said ""well you don't have a receipt so I can't check"" then refused to give us lemons on top of everything!

The restaurant had a pretty long wait but was very worth it. I highly recommend the cioppino in a bread bowl. It was so full of fresh fish and had a very good tomato sauce.

4/26/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","The restaurant has this 'cute little shack' (as my friend called it) feeling, very casual, and good for dates since it's right on the pier. The inside is quite small and they only have counters and stools instead of tables and chairs. We would prefer to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful ocean view, but it was way too windy today. The clam chowder was good, and filled with many clams. The shrimp and scallop pasta was very bland and it tasted like there was no sauce on it at all, might be one of the least tasteful pasta that I've had in a restaurant. The cioppino is a bread bowl filled with crab leg, shrimp, mussels, scallop, and clams, and I did liked the crab leg.",2 star rating,Alice L.
6/23/2013,"Irvine, CA","Fresh as F#%K. It seems kinda sad but it's oh so delicious! They literally fish the crab/lobster/abalone, etc. right out of the tank and cook it to order. If I didn't live so far (In Orange County) would eat here every weekend! Keep in mind that this place is NOT meant to be a fancy schmancy restaurant. It's meant to be a FRESH seafood place with very little additives. You are tasting the freshness, not the fancy french cooking that results in much higher prices and hides the true flavor of seafood.I've had seafood 2-3 times the price in some fancy restaurants in OC and it is no where as good as this place. It definitely is the freshness that make it good. because all it really is is a boiled shellfish right?  My wife had their shrimp & scallop pasta and it was cooked PERFECTLY! So they are not just good at boiling a crab, but the cook actually knows what he's doing. I highly suggest trying the ""Fried Calamari, Oysters, Shrimp, and Scallops"" as a starter.In terms of the wait. It looks like it can get pretty bad since there are no real tables inside. The whole place is kind of like a bar style seating, there are a few table right outside. If you really don't want to wait for a table, you can order the exact same food from the little window outside and eat at the picnic table near the restaurant right in the pier! I think I'll do that next time if it's a nice day.",5 star rating,Mike N.
5/28/2013,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA","I have very fond memories of this place. We always used to order at the window and eat our crab and piping hot clam chowder outside. I love the clam chowder! It's thick and creamy and totally filling. The dungeness crab is also delicious! The 2.5 pounder is enough for two hungry people.I would give this place 5 stars for all the great meals I've had here. When I was a kid, I didn't give much thought to service. Now that I'm all grown up, I don't let places slide as easily. Had to knock off a star for the last visit. The wait for a table inside was long so we ordered at the outdoors window and decided to eat outside even though it was windy and kinda cold. The guy taking the orders might have been new, but he didn't have his stuff together and the ordering process took forever! There were about 4 people in front of me and it took 30 mins. to place my order!! The food came out quickly though. We got the clam chowder in a bread bowl, the dungeness crab cocktail, and the garlic baked clams. Everything was good, but especially the clam chowder. That chowder hits the spot! The crab cocktail was tasty, but my dad and I both agreed that nothing beats cracking one open, getting at that crab meat yourself, and dipping it into melted butter. The garlic baked clams were tiny, but flavorful with lots of garlicky goodness with parmesan on top.",4 star rating,Manami Y.

9/13/2015,"Torrance, CA","I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. This is one of those occasions where yelp has steered me in the wrong direction. I don't understand why this restaurant has a 4 star rating. I ordered 1 whole crab, 1lb of shrimp, a lobster bisque and sea urchin (uni) through the take out window. First of all I asked the cashier if the uni was ""fresh"" because uni goes bad pretty quick.  I was assured that it was fresh so I went ahead and ordered it. A few minutes after I placed my order my number was called, the cashier apologize to me and said the chef will not be serving uni because its not fresh. I appreciate the honesty, and I was refunded for that item. The crab looked pretty good the shrimp looked scary, the bisque looked like chunky tomato soup with cheese. I started with the bisque and was disappointed almost immediately. It taste just how it looks... Like tomato soup... I didn't even finish it. Then I started eating the shrimp... They were mediocre... I had to dip them in the spiced ketchup to give it flavor. I saved the best or at least what I thought would be the best for last (crab) Disappointment again. The crab was under cooked. I couldn't really tell it was undercooked until I got to the claw. I pretty much ended up throwing $60 in the trash. I didn't bother even asking for them to make it right. Threw it in the trash.

For starters, we were starving when we arrived here. It's a really small place so if you want to sit outside (there are maybe four tables), you're waiting. We waited for maybe about 30 mins and jumped right into ordering our main course. I opted for the lobster tacos and he got one of the crab specials (which was pretty overpriced). I'm all about getting a little dirty when I eat, but these tacos were more like a burrito - totally overstuffed and whatever was inside so soft and mushy. I know there was lobster in there, but there was also another type of seafood which I couldn't put my finger on. I don't know, the combo just didn't sit well with me and I barely ate it.

2/25/2013,"San Diego, CA","We were really excited to come here to try some authentic seafood. We were starved from the drive and noticed a long wait to be seated.We opted to utilize the to-go window and eat at one of the open tables on the pier. [Watch out for all the flies!!!] We ordered the bread bowl clam chowder,  the crab cake, and small soda. Total came out to be about $27.Clam chowder: Disappointed with how watery it was. I always compare my chowder to the best chowder I have ever had, and that's at Pike Place Chowder in Seattle. This is nothing compared to Pikes. Crab cake: 1 cake and lacked the taste and flavor. In fact, it was rather bland. Luckily, it came with a lemon, and the lemon gave it some flavor. There were 2 onion rings that accompanied the crab cake, and the batter was the same - flavorless. Cole slaw was decent, at last.No free refills on soda, unfortunately.There's a parking lot on the pier, but you have to get your ticket validated. Otherwise, you have to park in the neighborhood, and walk the pier. Should you decide to eat inside, place your name immediately on the list. It may seem long, but people get antsy and leave.

6/4/2016,"Pittsburg, CA","This Place has it all! Perfect location, awesome atmosphere, cheerful staff, and great food. However it's not for the weak at heart because they kill, clean and cook your food right in front of you. If thats not for you, just don't sit at the bar. I suggest starting with the lobster bisque and the uni if it hasn't sold out by the time you get there. I mean, you can't go wrong with ordering any shellfish too since it is as fresh as it gets.The only mediocre dish I have had so far is the lobster sandwich other than that it's all great food and a great place to bring visiting friends and family. Ohh yeah make sure you get your name on the list early and walk around the little shops after, if your looking to get a seat inside. If not I think you can order at the side window and eat outside. Don't quote me on that cause I'm only assuming thats what the side window is for. Enjoy!  :)",5 star rating,Joseph L.
6/16/2008,"Los Angeles, CA","As first timers to SB, we wanted explore and have dinner at a random place on the pier, the Dick was pretty depressing and empty, the other forgettable restaurants didn't seem convincing; low and behold at the end of the pier was an establishment with not only a vast amount of spectators, there was also a wait for a table; not to mention a to go window on the other side ( how awesome is that?).  So I picked the Shellfish Company.  Apparently winners chose other winners.  This place was pretty damn awesome.  Service was prompt and friendly, Lauren I think her name was, really sweet; she offered to turn on the heater above us so I could enjoy the meal without cowering under my companion's jacket...Clam Chowder: Yuuum...it didn't even need any pepper, it was seasoned to perfection, just the right consistency.Lobster Bisque:  Delicious as well, not overly salted like most.Soju Bloody Mary:  My new favorite drink, I scoured SB the rest of the evening for this, and the ""soju"" mary we had with breakfast the next day tasted like watered down horseradish sauce/cocktail sauce.  This, however, was perfection in a pint.  Salted/peppered rim with limes and a celery stalk.  Main Lobster:  I finally fulfilled my fantasy of Daryl Hannah in ""Splash"" when she went to town on an entire lobster.  It was however, split in half when it arrived, but I just wanted to say that I've had an entire lobster, not just the tails like most restaurants serve it.   I've never used claw crackers before, but there's a first time for everything, and it was worth the non-work.  I not only drenched all the edible meat in the melted butter tin they gave me, I also took the remaining precious liquid as an after dinner shot.  Alaskan King Crab Legs:  Fabulous, the meat by itself was buttery, but wouldn't you know that it came with it's own companion of melted butter heaven.  Not to mention, kinda loved the coleslaw and onion rings....so wrong but so good.  All in all, we were seated on the outside deck, facing the sunset, stuffing out faces with alcohol and butter sea goodness.  It was an awesome ending to what might possibly be an incredible beginning.",5 star rating,Christina L.

1/15/2016,"Alhambra, CA","2 stars for the location and relaxing atmosphere. The view is really pretty and it's a nice, short stroll around the pier. If you're looking for great seafood, I'd suggest looking else where. We tried the dungeness crab, fried clams, clam chowder, and scallop ceviche. None of them were the best I ever had and the portions were quite small for the price. The dungeness crab was flavorless like bland chicken. When we asked the waitress why this was, she said it was supposed to be sweet. The manager refused to make it right. We left unsatisfied and unhappy. I felt like the manager or waitress should have explained why it tasted the way it did, instead of just asking us to order something else on the menu. This caused us to spend more money on another entree because the crab wasn't tasty enough to finish. I am not a picky eater and this was quite disappointing.",2 star rating,Grace C.

The local crab was alright, barely any meat and not worth the price. A few things i would get again are the onion rings, shrimp bisque, and sea urchin&scallop. The sea urchin and scallop tastes fresh and sweet. Because of the long wait each time, i always end up ordering from the side window and eating at the wooden tables!

4/2/2014,"Bakersfield, CA","Love the concept and luckily when we walked into this small, quaint little place on the pier, there was seating available at the bar.We had great service and our waiter was busser and the bartender. The food was just OK. It meant a lot to me that it was fresh and cooked to order.The clam chowder did not have a lot of flavor whatsoever. I had to add the crackers,salt, tobasco and luckily I carry my own little stash of cayenne pepper. I have had clam chowder all over the world and sadly, I cannot recommend this once. It needed some creaminess butt hat could be personal opinion. Get a cup if you are unsure like we did, a bowl of it is a big commitment. There were a lot of people working and things came out very quickly. Hubby had a local beer which he enjoyed and I had a glass of wine. A glass of wine here means a GLASS, loved it. No frills here, wine right to the top of a glass you would get at your granny's house.We split the fried platter with calamari, shrimp and scallops for $13. Not a ton of food  (3 pieces of each maybe) but the coleslaw complete with raisins and pineapple was a treat and they also throw on about 3 large onion rings. This was a nice dish to split so we did not ingest TOO much fried food. There is also the option to have fried oysters on it which we skipped. I imagine the more you order on the plate, the less you get of each.I would for sure come back here. Unpretentious and even a little gritty. Come as you are.If you want fine dining, there are other options on the pier.They will validate your parking if you park on the wharf.",3 star rating,Janna L.
1/26/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Everything was amazing! Between my boyfriend and I, we had (too many) oysters, half of a Maine Lobster, the best coconut shrimp we've ever tasted and then the highlight - I was so full but was so curious to try their Abalone. Normally they serve them pan-fried (I believe?) with rice and whatnot, but I couldn't do it. So, our waiter brings out two raw Abalone to try! My boyfriend /hated/ it, I loved it... such a weird texture! But, the highlight of the highlight, was we made friends with a couple from Norway one table over and, (thankfully our waiters were super cool about this), we shared our different types of Abalone. I gave them a little of the raw, they gave me the cooked (which was delicious)! All in all, a very fun restaurant with amazing food and great service!",5 star rating,Shelby Y.

It's right on the pier, so it gives you the Southern-California feel that tourists love (heck, I'm a So-Cal gal and even I love that feeling of basking in the sun while eating on the pier). We ordered fish & chips, oysters, crab cakes and more. It was all good. They don't have a kids menu but the waiter mentioned they have pasta or grilled cheese for the kids. My daughter ordered buttered pasta and my niece the grilled cheese. Can't go wrong with either. The prices are a tad steep for the food, but you're also paying for the experience, so I get it. Fun place; good food. I'd come back.",4 star rating,Janet E.
9/30/2013,"Garden Grove, CA","This place has got to be a tourist trap because of where it is located. Directly at the tip of the wharf looking out into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara sits the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company. They specialize in rock crabs and all types of seafood. Foodies and tourists far and wide would love to come here.Since the wait was too long for a regular table, we decided to order at the to-go window and seat ourselves at one of the public tables on the wharf. It is pretty much the same experience without the waiter service. The rocks crabs were tasty and came with plenty of meat. We also ordered a cup of their clam chowder which was creamy and awesome. There was a side of crispy onion rings to satisfy the mean.Definitely not cheap, but the scenic view while picking away at some grabs is worth the experience.",4 star rating,Ivy T.

10/25/2009,"Long Beach, CA","I love this place. Especially on a foggy day. Ive had so much fun in this tiny little joint at the end of the pier, a place offering fresh steaming seafood without a care as to who the hell you are or where you come from. They work fast and hard and I was amazed at how much food was prepped and pushed in front of avid, eager and hungry patrons of all walks.Farm raised abalones tasted wonderful fried quickly in butter and wine and served on a bed of rice with tomatos and basil with fresh sourdough. Mouth-watering delectables,  these abalone guys support a cottage industry from the greedy ab diving pigs and asses who don't obey conservation rules or countries with no rules whatsoever. Only $17.95 gets you one of the finest delicasies from the sea. And the clam chowder is excellent.We went back on our last day for more abs and the dungeness crabs and I felt wonderful flinging bits of crab everywhere, my care gone with the wind, and I was a mess though Jon still thought I looked killer in crabmeat.

11/30/2009,"Las Vegas, NV","I'm wavering on 3 or 4 stars, but after coming here a few times, it really depends on what you're eating. We first stumbled across this place a while ago at the end of the Stearns Wharf pier. With the smell of seafood wafting in the air, and our stomachs growling, we sat along the bar area facing the kitchen. We looked up and saw Oprah's boyfriend, Stedman, enjoying a grilled lobster by himself. If we said, ""where's Oprah?"" you think he'd be annoyed?The grilled lobster was juicy, succulent, with a nicely char grilled smoky flavor before dipping into melted butter. We returned recently, and the lobster was just as good as I remembered. It came with a side of either lobster bisque (need a microscope to find the lobster meat) or clam chowder, and some onion rings which were horribly soggy and oily. Unfortunately, at around 1 and a half pounds, the lobster ""special"" came out to around $37 alone ($25 per pound).Too bad this place is a bit of a tourist trap with high prices. You would think being so close to the coastline, the prices would be lower. If you are going to splurge, I suggest sticking with what's highlighted on the chalkboard. I recommend the grilled lobster. It's easy to make and doesn't take a whole lot of culinary expertise. Other stuff on their menu like cioppino, ceviche, pasta, etc are not their strongest dishes. My wife had the cioppino and everything about it was not fresh and bland, including the funky tasting dungeness crab and stale bread bowl.Service isn't exactly the most friendly, and for the amount of money you're spending, it should be better. You get the feeling the employees are just dragging their feet around. On the plus side, there are some eye-pleasing views of the water, unless you're fighting off the sea gulls trying to steal your food. Hey, anything but the lobster, pal. Oprah's boyfriend knows best.",3 star rating,Dru C.

7/18/2011,"Irvine, CA","There are many seafood restaurants around the wharf but the best one of the 4ish(?) has to be SB's Shellfish Company.Located in a huge tourist attracted area.. I highly recommend you park either.. far away and walk or if you're ballin' park inside the pier. Although let me remind you that there are people walking everywhere and you can hear the wood beneath your car. There is free complimentary valet parking when you first drive in towards the pier but meh, you wanna enjoy the sun!Santa Barbara's Shellfish Company is a rather medium-small restaurant with some outside seating. (Outside seating is much better. Really) The only not so fun thing about dining outside is the DAMN SEAGULLS AND THE PEOPLE WHO CONSTANTLY FEED THEM. These seagulls are BALSY. They WILL fly onto your table while you're eating and grab your food. This will happen if someone else is throwing food at them to eat so be careful! Ordered the Rock Crab special. (check the specials they have of the day. They're totally worth it!) It comes with a side of cesar salad with a cup of clam chowder. The chowder is DELICIOUS. The salad was delicious! and the crab? DELICIOUS. Although I had squirted crab juice all over the tables. Oh.. the tables may be a little ""sticky."" Crab is juicy and like it's name.. a rock hard shell. This is enough to feed two people so if you're on a date this wouldn't be a bad thing at all. :PAlso got the shrimp ceviche. Amazing! There was plenty of shrimp and a side of two wedges of lime. Before eating this.. remember to squeeze alllll of the lime and mix it. There's a little bit of juice on the bottom. The taste of shrimp and lime with a bit of a kick on a beautiful day with a mild ocean breeze makes this ""small bite"" a phenomenon. The only really big problem I had with this dish was the tortilla chips. They were elastically which most probably meant they weren't fried long enough. So there wasn't really a crunch but more of a bite and shake your head and hands to get it to rip. The price is reasonable for this meal and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is within the area to try. PS: If you want to know what your crab looks like before you eat--you can walk in to check it out. They're in huge fish tanks!PPS: Remember to sign your name on the wait-list and be present when they call you!",4 star rating,Monique N.

11/2/2009,"CA, CA","As the final minutes of my trip were coming to an end, I had to end it with a nice Clam Chowder Bread Bowl. Much to my dismay, I didn't have time to grab one up in the sourdough mecca San Francisco, so this would have to suffice. Yes, this is a little touristy, therefore it's a little pricey. It was $9 for it. The restaurant was a neat little seafood shack that didn't look like it offered much, but it did. I would have liked to have tried more, but it was still before noon and I wasn't that hungry, but I had to have a CCBB to make my trip complete. Service was quick and I opted to eat my soup out on the pier. I sat down and stared at my soup. It was decent sized and had more clam than potatoes, just how I like it. Contrastly, it was a little watery, not how I like it. It was good, but I definitely had better. The bread bowl was fresh and doughy. I sat there and enjoyed my bowl while staring at the sea and fending off the birds that were ogling my soup. One of them tried to move in on my food as I briefly turned my head. Man, those buggers are really on to you! As are the hobos. One of them came by and I gave him some 'spare' change and he blessed me. I took my time finishing it and reminisced back on my trip up to No Cal. It was very relaxing and melancholy at the same time. You never want a great trip to end.

Oh the food. I had the crab sandwich.   I hate to say I was disappointed.  Not because of flavor.  Because it was not what I wanted or expected.  It looked like a tuna sandwich but with a crab flavor.  I wanted (and would have paid for) lump crab on a roll.   The clam chowder was great with plenty of clams and potato.  Loved it.   BF had the calamari sandwich and would not stop raving about how good it was.   The calamari was pounded to about 1/2 inch thick and set atop a french roll with tartar sauce.  Sitting at the bar is fun.  You get a great view.  You get to see all the going's on in the kitchen.  You get service from friendly people that obviously enjoy what they doThank you!,4 star rating,Sandy P.

They are thick and tender with real crispy coating. Today I had a crab sandwich and I didn't love it. There were no chunks of crab at all, and it really didn't have much crab flavor either. The cole slaw has good flavor but the cabbage seemed a little wilted. Sometimes we've had good service and sometimes not. I think it's just hit or miss.

They'll be hiding under a rock until they can regrow their main source of defense.  But the crab in my Cioppino pulled out the short stick, I guess.No doubt, their ingredients tasted fresh.  But nothing really did stand out to make me want to come back again.  And for the prices they have?  You're better off shopping!  And for non-seafood eaters: there's nothing in the menu for you except Caesar Salad.",2 star rating,Mimi S.

12/18/2013,"Temple City, CA","Craving some seafood when strolling down the Stearns Wharf. Came into this hole in the wall seafood restaurant. Got the New England Clam Chowder in bread bowl and a cup of the Seasonal Bisque. The clam chowder was fresh, unlike the smell of the pier, it has big chunks of fresh clams in it which was delicious. The seasonal bisque was good as well. Definitely recommend the clam chowder. You won't be disappointed.",4 star rating,Kuen L.

The oysters were ok but served beautifully... We would probably visit again when were in the area!,4 star rating,Diana B.

5/29/2012,"Fairfield, CA","We made our way all the way to the end of the pier and added our name to the wait list. After a 45 minute wait, we finally got to our table outside. The view was amazing and although it was windy and a bit cold, the heaters above our table helped keep us comfortable. The Santa Barbara Shrimp Cocktail was just a standard shrimp cocktail, nothing spectacular. I had the crab sandwich, it was good but would have been better slightly warmer.My husband had the rock crab special which came with a Caesar salad and clam chowder. The clam chowder was excellent. He usually adds pepper but said it came seasoned just the way he liked it.  The crab was great too, a great deal and very high quality.Our son had the chicken strips, he ate 3 out of 4 of them, which means they must have been good!We had a pitcher of Firestone, they actually have a very good selection of beers on tap as well as by the bottle.The location is very casual, the inside consists of more bar like and stool seating. There are 4 actual tables outside with clear views of Santa Barbara.  The food is high quality and very much worth the price. Other than a long wait, it was a great experience.",4 star rating,Lisa D.
7/17/2016,"Cerritos, CA",I went here for dinner because my dad wanted the whole day to be seafood after seafood. I went to Brophy Bro's earlier that day for lunch so it was so easy to compare these two places especially since my parents are weird and basically ordered the same thing we had for lunch for dinner. We got the food from the walk up side since we didn't think we'd make it inside since it was packed and the waiting list was long. We ordered the cioppino (so much better than Brophy Bro's) the calamari pasta (DELICIOUS) and clam chowder. Maybe the food was more delicious since we were cold and needed the hot food to warm us up but the flavor of everything was so much better than lunch.,4 star rating,Jane Y.
3/2/2012,"Wilmington, DE","I give this an overall five stars for the entire experience.  I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. Overall one of the best experiences ever.  If you go to Santa Barbra you MUST go here!",5 star rating,Kent S.
5/19/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Ventured to this cute locale at the pier end on a Friday afternoon with my Mom. Not a super warm day so we opted for a couple of stools lining the perimeter facing the water. The inside of the restaurant isn't huge, maybe 20 people max? It was pretty crowded, but no waiting :) We started with the Coconut Shrimp, our favorite for the day. A decent portion (6pcs) of shrimp covered in a light coconut coating. Light, crispy and sweet and served with a slightly spicy and tangy dipping sauce with a few of their large house onion rings. One of their specials that day was the Fried Clam Strips...yes, I started with fried and continued with fried :) A generous portion of  lightly battered, seasoned fried clam strips served with a stack of their large onion rings. Tender meaty clam strips and sweet onions...very nice. My mom chose the crab cakes. These were disappointing. It was mostly filler and very little crab. I like my crab cake with lumps of crab meat...these cakes were so full of bread crumbs you could barely taste the minimal amount of shredded crab in the cake. Sorry, Shellfish Co., but I actually prefer the frozen cakes from Costco instead. - Sidnenote- Onion Rings- I normally don't like the thick cut onion rings (I prefer the thinner slices) but these were good! I believe they may have been sweet onions, not the brown? They're so thick, we had to eat them with a fork and knife! A nice change to the traditionally served french fries. The service was prompt and efficient and the food came out quickly. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things and should have tried other dishes? The guests sitting next to us had the steamed clams and crab...those looked good.",3 star rating,Syd M.
2/14/2016,"Brooklyn, NY","Went on a daytrip to Santa Barbara while visiting my brother and dad in LA this weekend. We found out about this place through Yelp reviews. No reservations - expect to put your name down and wait (we were told 2 hours but in the end we waited for less than an hour as people probably dropped off the waiting list or weren't there when their names were called). We ordered the lobster pasta which was yummy - the meat could've been more tender but it was flavorful. My bro and his gf ordered the rock crab (comes with clam chowder, salad and onion rings) which was delicious but took ages to eat, as everyone can attest it's not the easiest food to crack into (pun not intended lol). My dad ordered the abalone on tomato basil rice. I don't eat abalone but the rice was good although a little on the salty side. We were still not full so finished up with the beer boiled shrimp which was probably the highlight of the meal. Only subtracted one star as the lobster pasta could have been better, being a seafood place n all. Otherwise, worth a visit if you're around the Santa Barbara area.",4 star rating,Mellie J.

8/6/2017,"San Francisco, CA","Beautiful view and decent clam chowder, but literally everything else we ordered was under seasoned and bland.  It isn't hard to make such fresh seafood not taste good but these guys found a way. Bread bowl was a few days past stale and sandwich slices were only toasted on one side.  Like seriously?  Everything was dismally portioned and half assedly prepared, yet still somehow overpriced. Terrible service our orders arrived completely separately and we had to ask at least twice for napkins and silverware.",1 star rating,Joe N.

The restaurant itself is not large. some inside and outside seating. There's a restroom inside so you don't need to use the public one on the wharf. Given that list was fairly long, we decided to order from the to go window on the side. We ate at the benches on the wharf. We had the 3lb rock crab special, lobster linguini, fried appetizer (onion ring, calamari, shrimp, oyster) and the calm chowder bowl. It all came out to $67. The crab were 2 small one with a side of chowder and salad. All the food tasty fresh and good. Since it was windy stuff was blowing around. This restaurant is located at the end of the Santa Barbara Wharf. There is 90 minutes free parking on the wharf. afterwards its 2.50 per hour. They make you pay even if your one minute over.

The first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means I pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws. Barely any meat in the body. Second crab was the same thing just cut in half.

You would assume that a restaurant on a pier would have excellent seafood, right? Unfortunately, all of our seafood was overcooked and bland.

Attentive to all our needs without being overbearing, and had great recommendations on beer, daily specials, and everything in-between. We had the bread bowl of clam chowder, full crab, rice, and lobster pasta.

No problem. Gave us another soda with the correct taste. I don't remember the price back in 2002 for this bread bowl, but today the price is @ $8.95. It comes in a decent size enough for two people to share. If you can get a seat inside, do it.

4/14/2013,"Santa Monica, CA","I went on an impromptu Santa Barbara day trip and wanted some seafood.  So I was excited to find this place on the Stearns Harbor.  Parking is on the dock and it is free with validation for 90 minutes.This establishment is super small with bar seating, seating along the back wall or outside.  I recommend sitting at the bar (if it is too cold to sit outside) because you get to watch the cooks and you have a nice view out the window.  There was about a 20 minute wait, so don't forget to sign in on the clip board.I decided to order the cioppino ($18) and my server suggested to get it spicy.  The cioppino comes in a bread bowl and is full of shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, and a quarter of a crab.  It was really filling, however, I wish that it came in a regular bowl with bread on the side because the bread bowl soaked up all the yummy stew-y goodness.  I loved it spicy!I also ordered a side of onion rings...couldn't help myself because they were frying them in front of me and they looked super delicious.  They had a panko batter on them and were perfectly crisp but on the bland side.Service was delightful, friendly and my server gave good recommendations.  All in all, a good experience!",4 star rating,Sarah L.

7/7/2010,"South Pasadena, CA","A trip to Santa Barbara wouldn't be complete until you get some local fresh seafood. This is the place to find super fresh seafood! A tourist must-stop BUT NOT a tourist trap! Come early or else expect to wait. This place is super small, bar seats inside and 4 booths outside. If you don't want to wait, you can order from their to-go window and enjoy the seafood at one of the picnic tables on the wharf. We decided to order a local SPIDER CRAB, which was $8.50 per pound. Our crab came out to be 4 lbs. It came with two cups of soup, two ceasar salads, and onion rings. For the two soups, we chose one CLAM CHOWDER and one LOBSTER BISQUE. The clam chowder was delicious with LOTS of clams in it, not the typical ones with more potato than clams. The lobster bisque didn't have much lobster taste though, it was more of a tomato-based lobster bisque. The crab tasted really fresh. The shell was thicker than the usual crabs I've eaten, but they provided crackers and tiny forks to get all the meat out. The crab was very meaty, in both the legs and the body. After they cook it, they break off all the legs, take off the body shell, and split the body into two pieces. This makes it much easier to eat. We also ordered the garlic baked clams. WOW, I was in awe after eating it. The clams were HUGE and really FATTY! I've never seen such big clams. They tasted super fresh. There was minced garlic on top of each clam, which just brought out the natural sweetness of the clam. However, the prices were pretty steep, $12.95 for 6 clams. BUT I think it is TOTALLY WORTH IT! We also ordered a CRAB SANDWICH. It was pretty good, but nothing special or amazing. They do give a lot of crab salad in the sandwich. It comes with a side of onion rings, which were pretty good. Service: Don't expect too much from this place, its not a place where you would go for spectacular service. However, the service was pretty good given how busy they were at the time. They came by immediately whenever we flagged them down. Parking: You can park on the wharf. It is free for 90 minutes with a validation. Its $2.50 for every hour after that. If not, you can always park on the shore and walk onto the wharf.",5 star rating,Vickie C.

Once we got inside, we were seated at the bar. We ordered 3 out of the 4 specials, as seen on the board (yelp.com/user_local_phot… ):- Rock Crab Special with the clam chowder and salad (yelp.com/user_local_phot…)- Local Ridgeback Shrimp (yelp.com/user_local_phot… )- Alaskan King Crab Leg (I apologize for not having a picture link here; I got too hungry to take a picture)To accompany our meal was a big pitcher of Santa Barbara Blonde.The salad and the soup came out first. The soup was good, but I was more interested in the seafood. There's only one place seafood belongs other than the ocean - in my moutH!The crab was cleaned out of its guts, which was a disappointment for me, but it was still good with the side of butter. The beer battered shrimp was definitely my favorite of the night and he loved his crab legs.Like I said, we ate until it got dark. The couple from Arizona on our left and the family of four on the right were amazed with our bottomless stomachs, especially since we ordered a lot more than they did....geez, I feel like so much of a fatty after writing that sentence.

They have blended seafood but that's not the worst part.  We waited over 2hours to be seated and as you may know they don't have enough tables. We thought that it was going be worth it but it turned out to be waste of time and money. Ok, the food was about average, their clam chowder was nothing better than Whole Foods's, but the worst part was their servers were so rude and careless. It seems like since this restaurant has been popular for a long time, they didn't care about service anymore. It took an hour for us to get water and napkins even though I asked the server many times. I barely got them right before I left. Don't expect smile here, you will be disappointed. All the server cared about was checking how much tip she got every time people left. All the people at other tables looked unhappy with the service since they were also calling the servers over and over again. I was so happy to be in Santa Barbara but my experience here was very unpleasant. I left no tip for the first time in my life.

If you sit by the bar, you can see the chefs cooking, they are all really friendly as well and cook up a mean meal! I would definitely try their crab specials, and the Alaskan king crab legs are amazing! Specials normally come with soup and/or salad, deals are good. Can be a bit of pain to get those crab shells off though! Wasn't a fan of their twist on their oysters rockefellar - it had lots of spinach. But the size of the oysters are generous.

10/3/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","A must-come place in SB. I bought a $60 Groupon for $100 at this place and it was seriously worth it! The wait for the restaurant is really long but there are poke stops nearby for Pokemon Go players lol. It is hard to find parking in this parking lot because most people are here for this restaurant or to play Pokemon Go. Remember to validate your parking ticket because the parking lot is only 90 min free parking, and the time would definitely exceed when you enjoying the delicious food after having waited in line for so long.",5 star rating,J.

11/19/2013,"Long Beach, CA","Sooooo good! Pure awesomeness! I loved this place.  It was uber packed, and we opted to order our meal to go and avoid the line for the sit down.  Even then, we were lucky enough to miss the rush! Whew. The cashier was great and gave us a few recommendations and in the end we went for the 2 rock crabs, a cup of clam chowder, onion rings, and steamed clams.  Yeah...we had enough food to feed 4 people.  The crabs were cooked fresh to order and they were such a treat.  Everything was super fresh and every bite was like a bit of the ocean.  The steamed clams were amazing! White wine and garlic...so down!  Can't go wrong...ever. Only dish we didn't like? The clam chowder. Not a huge fan of SB clam chowder (don't judge me).  It was just too thick...and just kinda rich.  Lacked the brininess that you typically equate with clam chowder.  Either way, the next time I'm in SB--I will most definitely make a point of stopping by again.",4 star rating,Angela T.
5/2/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Hi guysI luv eating n this place coz their seafood is so fresh & tasty. I usually go there with my brother. Both of us luv seafood, so this place is the best place to find fresh seafood. Also, the restaurant has outside seatings which is a perfect thing to enjoy the ocean's view while you're eating. For appetizer you can get baked oysters. It very tasty and you can feel the flavor in them. For the soup you should try clam chowder. It's great coz this soup is full of staff, such as potato bites, and some of seafood bites. For the entrée you get king crab. This crab is full of meet which you can dip it in a melted butter with salad, fries, or onion rings for the side. My brother like to get lobster or seafood bread which is full of oysters, muscles, and other staff with kinda of soup or sauce. YummyI think if you luv fresh seafood, you'll luv this place.",5 star rating,Hend B.

The bread bowl clam chowder was okay, but the bread was incredibly stale which I've never come across, ever. The bread bowls at food court malls are sadly better. The crab cakes were okay, I've had much better. The oysters at $34 a dozen were very disappointing, I've also had much better. All in all, I've experienced MUCH better.. I'll be sure to find another establishment to get my seafood fix while in Santa Barbara, because Shellfish Co you've let me down :(",2 star rating,Aurora L.
1/4/2009,"Vancouver, Canada","Loved it, but more the ambience than for amazing food.  It helped that it was a beautifully sunny New Years day, and mid-afternoon with no line-up to get an inside bar chair.  Only because of recommendations here and in the Skywest Airlines magazine that we tried it in such a probable-tourist-trap location.  4 photos posted.VERY cute inside, very clean, friendly and helpful staff.  Great view from our window seat over the harbour.  Ordered:1) the calamari sandwich:  I switched ciabatta for toasted sourdough and requested chipotle mayo on the side.  It was a large piece of breaded, deep-fried calamari with tomato and lettuce.  The calamari was extremely tender (!) but the sandwich was nothing special.  No particular flavour that justified the US$13 but the ambience was fun.2) seasonal lobster soft-tacos:  sauteed lobster with tomatoes and spices, but lobster is very mild and again, can't say they were amazing.  Good, well prepared and presented, but the dish wasn't worth US$16.Go for the experience and order a beer and appy.  **Had friends go later that day & they really enjoyed the experience and seeing the kitchen action from their barstools that overlooked it.  They felt the same I did about the food.",4 star rating,Littlefish B.

11/1/2008,"Big Sur, CA","Let's start off by clearly stating that I have a profound weakness for 'crab shacks'. When eating seafood, I am not enthralled by fancy service, swanky ambience, or linen tablecloths. For us, it's all about the food, so if you're eating shellfish, crustaceans, or any other sea creatures where freshness is paramount, then it's all about location, location, location. The closer to the source, the better.So it will be no surprise that we're big fans of the SB Shellfish Company, or as it's referred to in our household, the Shack.We live just a few blocks away, so we usually just bike up the pier and when possible, grab a table at the bar overlooking the open kitchen, or outside on the harbor side of the Shack (that way we can sit outside, and have a beer too).The menu's not all high-end. Lots of fried combo's (all good). The real treat though is gobbling down a plate of oysters, maybe a small cup of NE chowder, followed by any one of their seasonal specials. The tanks are always filled with live crabs, lobsters, etc --so freshness is never an issue. The open kitchen is a joy to watch, and the food is fast and honest. When it comes to casual non-sushi seafood in Santa Barbara, there is no competition. The Shack is the place to enjoy a beer, some tasty treats, soak up the sea breeze, and watch all the sail boats trafficking in and out of the harbor. A perfect afternoon.",4 star rating,Dirk R.

OMFG!! It had crab claws, shrimps, scallops, mussels and to top it off it was in a bread bowl.  SOOOOO-GOOOODDD!!  The fried calamari and onion rings were full of flavor and the breading was just right not overly breaded.  You can totally taste the sweetness of the calamari.   We sat in the patio to look at the ocean and smell clena salty air. Dude your in SB you gotta enjoy the views.  The price was resonable..just make sure you are there when they call your name.  And its faster if you ask to sit in the patio rather than inside.  Its pretty cramped inside.  Love this place!!  =P",4 star rating,Merrill M.
8/1/2013,"Hayward, CA","My husband had the crab sandwich, which he thought was pretty good (a bit heavy on the mayo). I was tempted to get the pasta with scallops and shrimp, but I heard that they are imported from Mexico or Asia. So much for ""local"" seafood. So we settled on getting the crab dishes. I had the clam chowder and the 1.5 lb local crab. The clam chowder bowl was good, but not the best that I've had. I think I like mine a bit chunkier, though I appreciated the big pieces of clam. The local crab today was a rock crab, different than a dungeness crab -- flakier, saltier. For $15, I felt like it was a good price for a meal. Tip: Order to go and skip the lines. Eat on the picnic benches. Same menu is available for to-go.Side note: It was cool walking the pier afterwards and seeing a kid crabbing and catching the exact same type of crab. I realized I could have saved $15 if I only had the equipment and patience :)",4 star rating,melissa c.
8/25/2014,"San Dimas, CA","Discovered the Santa Barbara Shellfish company by accident. I saw that the wait was abnormally long, even for a Saturday night. Visually, it's a dive and very casual restaurant. Decided to go for Sunday late lunch after 1:30 p.m. on Sunday instead.There are no real tables unless you sit outside, you sit on a counter where they do most of the cooking or a ledge by the window. Outside has patio seating. My boyfriend and I started with the oyster shooters and the fried scallop and fried oyster plate. Loved both. They use Japanese Panko crumbs instead of batter which is a big plus. Then we decided to splurge and share the Full size lobster! Absolutely delish! Grilled Lobster to be exact... succulent and cooked to perfection and worth every penny! ($39). It's served with a large cup of bisque (lobster or chowder), we had the scrumptious lobster bisque, and also served with a creamy pineapple coleslaw and a few onion rings. I had a great experience with the service. I guess we just got lucky. The place gets pretty hectic and people get impatient so they tend to be rude, which then makes the staff defensive. Can't blame them. Always be nice to restaurant staff and they'll be nice to you! Simple...Long story short... the food is great. Great portions. A little pricey, but hey... it's friggen beautiful Santa Barbara, it's expected. Worth it.... BUT, still cheaper than Moby Dick Sea Food which is next door... horrible, no flavor, over cooked food and more expensive!!! I digress.....Only gave 4 stars because the place is a bit visually dirty inside and out. They definitely need to ""clean"" the place up a bit. I like rustic charm and all but not splattered lobster and crab juice on walls and windows. Also, Can barely see out of the windows because they're so dirty, which was a shame since I was facing the ocean and it would have been a glorious view. Anyway.... please give this place a try! Food is great. But be patient, you will have to wait. Bring a snack if need be. Sorry, no photos...my hands were full of lobster and butter. :)",4 star rating,Lulu I.

Last time i left a review that the lobster tacos had too much garlic it overpowered everything. Well this time the lobster tacos were perfect. Clam chowder was good as always and i loved the fried seafood platter(shrimp, scallop, calamari, oyster and onion). All flavorful and worth the money! Big portion too.

My husband LOVES this place but every time I go it's mainly because he loves the seafood so much (which he raves about). There's things to order FYI - like I just do a small garden salad and have them make a cream sauce linguini entree, with a little parm - kind of like fettichini (sp)  I guess you could say. So I am really hoping that this place one day there could be a non-shellfish dish and it would cause us to come here even more often :) I know it's silly to insist something like this, but it would just be really nice to have an alternative!Regardless, my partner always says his food is a 5/5 so this review is from how he reviews his food, and where i'd solidly put this place!

6/12/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","Completely overrated, I had the Steamed ""Local"" Crab, it tasted bitter. I read online that when it tastes bitter is because the crab died and released its toxins inside it body-meaning it was not fresh-, or because it is infected with a parasite. I got the local crab thinking it would be the freshest one, but to my surprise the taste of it was not good at all, the bitter taste was odd.

He does bang the pots LOUDLY - so be aware of your ears are sensitive. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it and is cheaper than many in town. The wharf is fun and we love going for lunch as well - they will allow your dog at the outside table and even brought ours a fresh bowl of water - and I didn't even ask them! We will be back!

It was okay to me. Not the best, but better than most.Crab sandwich however was very~ bland. Me and my company we both didn't enjoy it at all...The seafood pasta was actually a better option. Maybe because it is freshly made in front of your eyes, or the shrimp and the scallop made it taste a whole lot better~The location is convenient off of SB pier and the beers on tap is good~I'd say try it, but the items on the menu seem to be a hit or a miss.

Go there expecting 5-star food in a fun environment!",5 star rating,Debi R.
5/25/2008,"Pasadena, CA","Stop #4 brought me to this great little seafood spot in SB.  Thank you fellow Yelpers!  This place probably seats about 20 total, indoor and out so be prepared to wait.  But according to locals, it has the freshest fare on the entire pier.The sweetie and I sampled the rock crab, crab bisque, and beer battered shrimp.  All quite tasty and fresh.  I felt like Tom Hanks in 'Castaway' while filling up on all that great fresh seafood.   Awesome little spot, some of the best seafood I've had in SoCal.",5 star rating,Dave C.

It was pretty busy at around 2pm and we sat outside after about a ten minute wait. The food was really really good. My boyfriend just loves crab so he ordered the stone crab special. It was very sweet and fresh! I ordered a grilled prawn caesar salad and it was awesome!! The reason for 4 stars is for the service. Our server just made me feel a little weird, like she was really irritated. Plus, we barely saw her. Other than that, the food was great!!",4 star rating,Jamie S.
8/1/2017,"PLAYA DEL REY, CA","What a view on a nice day! We were fortunate to have the marine layer burn off in time for lunch. Free parking on Stearns wharf for the first 90 minutes. Really a good deal for parking. Hearing the creaks and groans as you drive on on the wooden pier can be unsettling. You can also find parking elsewhere, like on the street, and walk out there. Yeah, it's kind of expensive, but what do you expect for a touristy place with a great view? We bought from the take-out window, and sat at one of the public benches. I tried the uni special, 6 pieces of uni, on top of halves of large raw scallops, on top of thin slices of lime, about $22. The uni was the freshest that I've ever eaten. The flavor wasn't a whole level above what I get in a good Japanese restaurant, but the texture was the most delicate, I've experienced. The plate comes with half of the empty sea urchin shell, which is quite an attraction, and conversation starter with strangers. We also ordered a 2 lb. rock crab, which was quite good. We know that everyone recommends the Dungeness, but at $23+ per pound, we just weren't willing to shell out that much for crab. We were quite content with what we got, except that the crab was so much work to eat, that we were hungry by the time we were finished. One visit here was enough for us.",4 star rating,Randy L.

2/22/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA",The husband and I like coming for the fresh but not fancy seafood.  The place is a scene with live crabs being plucked out of the tank and cooked fresh.  We enjoy seating near the water to enjoy as much of the sun and ocean as possible.  I usually get the steamed crab which is not huge but a decent size.

I don't understand how something can be both overseasoned and bland at the same time. The pasta and lobster were overcooked. The linguini was  limp and mushy and the lobster was tough and flavorless. I'm seriously baffled by how someone can manage to make lobster not taste good. That takes real talent. I could've made something better at home with the same ingredients. Even the guys next to us left half their plates uneaten behind. Only upside is that the wait staff seemed sincere. Slammed, but sincere. Wish I had nicer things to say.",2 star rating,Julia C.

8/31/2012,"Chino, CA","When looking for some good seafood in Santa Barbara, look towards Stearns Wharf. Put on some comfortable walking shoes and head towards the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company at the end of the pier.Upon arriving at the restaurant, please read the sign that is at the door. Put your name on the clipboard and they will call you inside when it's your turn. It is a bit of a wait but it's worth it, the food is amazing. Take a seat on a bench, enjoy the sea-breeze, and wait to hear your name called. Once inside my wife and I started off with the small clam chowder and we asked for some sourdough bread. The bread was fresh and with a little butter, it hit the spot. The chowder was delicious, fresh, creamy, and full of treats. For our meal, I ordered the shrimp with scallop pasta and my wife had the crab cakes. Both dishes were amazing and left us satisfied. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better, they have Pyramid Hef on tap. A good beer to compliment great dishes.Staff works hard and is running around tending to everyone.

Well I certainly found it.While the setting on the Wharf and the staff couldn't have been nicer, the food was pretty much inedible except for the New England clam chowder. The shrimp tacos were measly , tasteless , and dry served with an unripe avocado and terrible rice. What was billed as a Lobster Roll had the texture of Crab Salad served on a grinder roll. We sent it back and ordered Lobster with Pasta. Tasted of white wine, and I have no idea what the lobster was I've never seen Lobster like that. Like it was beaten up and shredded.

8/7/2015,"Huntington Beach, CA","Went there on Thursday late in the  afternoon, I was really looking forward to their Sea Urchin and rock crab, unfortunately they were sold out. Their next batch was not to come in from their fisherman until the evening (at we know it's fresh). Settled for their scallop ceviche -- it was a bit underwhelming, flavor was a bit lacking. Their clam chowder was really good. Crab cakes were a bit subpar (not enough crab chunks, kinda doughy). I may return again the next time I'm up that way. Will try to get there a bit earlier in the afternoon for availability of rock crab and sea urchin. I am really hoping the place can redeem itself the next time around.",3 star rating,Minh N.
4/6/2014,"Mountain View, CA","Great location, friendly and efficient service, good food. My boyfriend and I were here just for a quick snack to hold us over until dinner so we just had the shrimp cocktail, the crab cocktail, and two oyster shooters. Everything tasted great and I loved how fresh the seafood was. I even ate the shrimp and enjoyed it even though I very rarely eat shrimp. The reason why I give it 3 stars is just because nothing about this place or the food really stood out too much. Yes, it's a fun hangout spot for a weekend afternoon and I might go back someday to try some other stuff (lobster tacos anyone?), but I wouldn't say it blew me away.P.S. Stay away from the Bloody Mary's... The one I ordered barely had any flavor and tasted more like vodka on ice than anything else.

6/23/2008,"San Francisco, CA","My boyfriend and I were trying to find a casual place to eat after basking in the sun, and trying to get a tan on the beach. We happened to take a stroll on the harbor, and landed here.A small little place with a waitlist, it was what we expected out of a Santa Barbara restaurant: Fresh seafood! My boyfriend and I decided to try the local crab: Spider Crab! It definitely looked like a spider sorta (maybe just the legs). The exterior (shell) was weird, and had a purplish color to it. The texture of the crab wasn't my favorite: kind of tough, and the way it broke away from the crab resembled fingers unlike the traditional Alaskan crab (thin, shredded, diagonal). I wasn't that impressed with it. The crab was $8.50 a lb, which included 2 caesar salads and 2 clam chowders/bisques. My boyfriend wasn't full with the crab, so he ordered a 1/2 order of steamed mussels and clams. That was pretty good, but the wine garlic sauce could have been a bit too salty for me....I would probably come back here for something other than the local Spider Crab, but it's definitely worth the try...since it's supposedly Santa Barbara seafood cuisine! Btw, the food could get a bit pricey...",4 star rating,Rachel C.

The place looked packed inside and there were a lot of groups waiting outside the door. Always a good sign, right? We were too hungry to wait and almost moved on to another place to eat. Fortunately we figured out that there was a window on the side of the building where you can order food and sit outside to eat at the tables nearby.We ordered the crab sandwich and crab bisque in a bread bowl to share. I thought both dishes were very good. Fiance is more picky about his seafood and thought  they were both only ok. Only gripe I had was that the sandwich was small for $10.95. Just like any pier/wharf, beware of seagulls and eat at your own risk. We had one that was relentless and watched us like a hawk. The fiance got up real quick to throw something away and the seagull tried to divebomb our food. Bastard.",4 star rating,Jean L.

Santa Barbara Shellfish Company was a great choice. It's located on the end of Sterns Pier so the view is spectacular. The mountains in the background nestling the coast on one side and the ocean, fishermen and harbor on the other.Their prices are very reasonable for fresh seafood and the service was pretty good. The waiter was well informed on the menu and the differences between the choices of crab.I chose the half Maine lobster and my wife chose the local fav Spider Crab special with the soup (clam chowder). I added a cup of the lobster bisque and an oyster shooter to my order.Both of us enjoyed our soups... the lobster bisque was better than the clam chowder though. Eating the spider crab took a lot of work with the crackers... much more so than the lobster or a soft shell crab. Some of you may be saying, ""no duh!"", but we weren't prepared for that. Neither of us like having to work that hard for our food!I enjoyed my lobster more than my wife enjoyed her crab. The lobster was tender and delish with plenty of meat in the half lobster meal.My one complaint with the service was that neither of us received dressing for our salads.

The crab sandwich was decent, but flavorless, you could hardly tell that it was crab. My mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious, though ridiculously overpriced at $20. The clam chowder was thick and buttery, and the bread bowl was once again stale. Overall, a very disappointing meal that was insanely overpriced. Such a bummer.",2 star rating,Liz O.
12/16/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Got the crab special. Caesar salad, clam chowder, 3lbs crab, and 2 big onion rings. $23. A great deal for fresh seafood and a beautiful view! Everything was perfect other than the onion rings, which were very oily and didn't taste like onion or ring... just oil. I did see the guy kill the crab with a giant hammer and knife in the window right after I ordered, which made me feel a little guilty. Admittedly, I'm no better since I ripped that crab apart and then used my teeth when the little metal tool wasn't enough to get at that delicious crabmeat.There was a long wait outside but it was Saturday around dinnertime and they won't seat you until your whole party is there.  Fair policy given how busy it gets.  I was pretty hangry by the time we were seated because half of our party was annoyingly late.  To make matters worse, there was a family waiting next to us that had a bakery box of tasty treats.  It was no ordinary bakery box... it was filled with mini bananas and baked items unlike any I'd ever seen...  a magical, mystical box of yummies.Bring a jacket if you go in the evening because it's pretty windy out on the pier and you may have a long wait / get seated outside.",4 star rating,Jane C.

5/1/2016,"Ashland, OR","Can get pretty crowded. The fresh shellfish options are great. I split the 3lb rock crab and a calamari appetizer, along with many beers, with 4 people and it was the perfect amount. It is a relatively small restaurant and very popular so be prepared to wait.",4 star rating,Steven N.
7/31/2015,"Los Filabres-Tabernas, Spain","The place is situated picturesquely at the end of the wharf. Friday at 2:30pm there was a 25 min wait to get a seat.  Service was fine. The place has a cramped feel. The food was sort of disappointing. Most people were ordering crab, which is probably the best bed. I couldn't resist the raw oysters and uni. The oysters were good, but no deal at $17 for a half dozen. The uni was fresh and served on top of fresh scallop slices and a ponzo type sauce. The sauce overpowered the uni sort of ruining it. The clam chowder was good. The lobster pasta that my dining companions shared was horrible. It tasted like some poorly made pasta with some dried up lobster scraps met a glass of cheap chardonnay.  Not subtle nor simple, just bad. Maybe try the crab if you go? Not impressed.",2 star rating,Steve C.
9/18/2015,"San Jose, CA","For those who want a quick review: food was just okay with nothing to rave about and so was service. Cool view if you're outside, but it's very noisy and hectic if you're sitting inside. Prices are good, but I would have rather paid more for better food, and there is def better in Santa Barbara!Parking wasn't bad for a busy day, first 90 minutes are free with validation, $2.50 per hour after that. Details: We were excited to try this place since it has good reviews, but nothing was that good to us. I understand that it's a tourist attraction and on the wharf so expectations shouldn't be high, but the oysters didn't seem that fresh, especially the kumamotos.Our best part of the meal was probably the calamari pasta, the calamari wasn't chewy and the pasta was good. Also, service was not the best. We were seated at the bar and our server was nice but not very attentive even though we were right in front of her a majority of the time. Handed us items without looking at us, talked poorly about other guests right in front of us, and we had to ask for napkins and silverware when our food came out. Overall, I wouldn't return, but it wasn't bad so 3 stars?",3 star rating,Hana C.
2/10/2013,"San Diego, CA","5 stars just for the clam chowder bread bowl! I literally crave this stuff every few months for no reason except its chunky, creamy, bacon-y and clam-chunk-y delicious nature. Seriously the best clam chowder around. If you're not a local and visiting Stearns Wharf, this is definitely the place to go.One star off simply because it is TINY. Very hard to get seats inside and it's bar-style seating in the interior (there are some chilly outdoor tables that are more restaurant-y, but only in warm spring or summer months), definitely not an upscale, sit-down restaurant if that's what you're in the mood for. But if you're looking for yummy, hot chowder in a fun, community setting, then go for it. Also, the last time we came my clam chowder was a little lukewarm, which is a strange pet peeve of mine, but otherwise delicious as usual. My boyfriend ordered the lobster and I ended up stealing it even though I hate lobster - it's that good!!Definitely recommend.",4 star rating,Kate S.

Husband had the Maine Lobster, and daughter had the local crab plate. We were all very happy with our meals! Shawn, the manager was our waiter and was wonderful, even helping to crack my daughters crab claw open!

It's not an ice cream cafe'.  It's a seafood restaurant .Stuck because we had a groupon that needed to be spent . So we endured an excruciatingly long wait ( the longest in my life-- for real) , for just ok food . Nothing stellar. Nothing great . Why the 5 star ratings from other folks ? I haven't a clue. Maybe it's better than the red lobster they are accustomed to ?Save your money . It's a great location, with great potential . But four tables, and the rest stools squeezed side by side ?

It was more bread bowl than any chowder.-Girlfriends lobster bisque was bland.

We ordered their dinner specials and they hit the spot for craving seafood:~1/2 Maine lobster, served with onion rings and a salad - wished we ordered the full 1 & 1/2 lbs instead.~1 steamed rock crab, served with calm chowder and salad - everything about this plate is amazing. Keep in mind, this place is tiny and not a typical restaurant with fancy tables. There are counters that run along the front and back of the restaurant. We ate at the counter facing the wharf.

To begin with, clam chowder was cold, yuk!  The crab sandwich only had one piece of sourdough toasted, the server explained that they didn't have enough time to toast both slices. The bread was not the typical ""San Francisco"" delicious sourdough, but ordinary store-bought. I asked why there was rice in my lobster tacos and the server explained that that was the lobster!!!  Thank goodness for the screw top $22 bottle of wine, it saved the day.",1 star rating,Kristin N.

But if 2 stars is ""I've experienced better,"" then that's what that was.The whole Dungeness crab was not sweet but slightly bitter tasting... Out of all the weird flavors sub-par crab can be, I've never really had that one before. I have no idea how to explain such an outcome... The lobster bisque wasn't any more impressive - flat with one stale piece of lobster in it.Of note, I had a seat at the counter and during the whole time I did not see one single crab being pulled out of the tanks. So for all intensive purposes, I do not know where the crab that was served to me came from... that's all I'm saying..",2 star rating,M R.

I also tried the crab cakes but they had too much bay seasoning in them, so the crab meat was really lost. Their fried seafood dishes were average.  I would stick to the really fresh items like lobster, crab & oysters.  Our waitress was friendly, this place is definitely worth a visit.",4 star rating,Beatrix T.

We heard this placed was known for spider crab, so we made a point to order it! 5.5 LB of spider crab and another 3 LB rock crab. The entrees also came with a side of your choice of soup and salad (nothing to rave about). Me and my 2 other guests quickly polished off those monsters from the sea. So delicious!!!

There was too much cheese in it.Oysters half-dozen  - $16 - 3/5 (Market Price)- The oysters are OK.... Brophy Bros down the street is fresher, and half the price.Steamed local crab - $16 - 3/5 - 1 and half pound of crab w/ onion rings & coleslaw.  The crab was steamed too much and was dry.  The inside is really small and only has counters/bars.  Not a good place for groups.  I'd recommend Brophs Bros down the street.",2 star rating,Mike T.
10/30/2014,"San Marcos, CA","We arrived about half an hour after they opened on a Monday and were seated right away (inside), the outside tables were already taken. Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable. There are no tables inside just a counter that runs around the wall. This is a little awkward because you are staring at the people and table directly on the other side of the window. We ordered the fried clams (they don't come in an appetizer size) so you get a rather large portion with coleslaw. I think there is way too much breading and is overly greasy. I ordered the local fresh rock lobster and my husband had the abalone special. The rock lobster is $40lb and the tails are 1.5-2lbs. This came with soup, clam chowder and it was very good. The lobster itself was big and delicious. My husbands abalone was well cooked but didn't like the sauce that was all over it...too much rice too little abalone. The bill came to a whooping $150 which included one glass of wine (house chard..not good) and one beer.

If it was not located at the best view spot on the pier at Stearns Wharf, it would not be high on my list of places to visit.The waiting list for a table in the limited space inside is long, and customer-driven (write down your party name and wait to be called). Because of this, I chose the shorter wait for a spot at the public benches from the self-serve window. The food is good and the service is prompt, but the presentation is modest. Expect something akin to paper plates and ketchup packets. A lot of people visit the area, so the benches are messy.

12/8/2013,"Pasadena, CA","I came here because a friend highly recommended it. Just in location alone, at the end of a pier, in beautiful Santa Barbara, a small bar/shack restaurant, it is a fun and romantic set up.The place is small and everyone is seated counter style along the kitchen and along the windows. There are some tables outside as well. You will get to know your neighbors, so get ready to be cozy. But I found this part of the charm and fun.The seafood is fantastic. Fresh, simple and just a pleasure. I have been here twice, the first time we shared the 3 lb crab, shared the clam chowder and both had oyster shooters and an extra order of onion rings. The crab was fresh and that platter was worth it. The clam chowder had lots of chunks of clam and a good briny broth. The oyster shooters were delicious. The onion rings were more heavily battered than I liked, but still tasty.The second time, we got ciopinno and clams strips. The cioppino was served in a large sour dough bowl brimming with a garlicky, spicy broth and chunks of scallops, shrimp, mussels and a side of crab. I LOVED IT. For winter time, this is the dish to get! We also got the clam strips and they were very well prepared. Not too heavily battered and the clams were tender.Overall, I have several items on the menu and covered the bases among steamed and fried dishes. I will come back and look forward to making the drive to visit this place again. It's a gem!",5 star rating,Kiki D.

The salad was, well, how can you go wrong with caesar?  I also ordered oysters on a half shell and those were awesome!  Now, for the main course, the rock crab... wow.  It was delicious!  My wife had the exact same order and we loved this place.  All for less than $80!Great service as well! Our waitress was very friendly and always came back asking if everything was alright.  Try to visit though when it's not cold and raining, so you can enjoy the walk back from the pier.  Overall, had a great time!

Started with the shrimp ceviche...oh wait I really started with a fantastic Bloody Mary followed by the ceviche. Had the lobster roll which was rich and full of lobster. The cole slaw was old school and had raisins which no one does anymore. My kid had the shrimp tacos which liked great and he wouldn't share.

9/14/2014,"Antioch, CA",Do not come here if there are more than 4 people in your party and you want to eat outside.  They do not take reservations and the staff cannot judge how long a wait will be. We were told 25-30 minutes. Talked to the waitress after 25 minutes and she rudely said it'll be another 20 minutes. Meanwhile people in smaller parties kept getting seated.

1/31/2012,"Long Beach, CA","I'm pretty sure I fell into a tourist trap by eating here.  The kind where you go because you think you're supposed to eat there, only to find yourself leaving with a much lighter wallet and a disappointed stomach.  The worst part is I knew better.  SIGHSo, the food was okay.  The lobster was good for sure.  It was easy to dig into with just your hands and a plastic fork, there was lots of meat, and the butter that it was served with was the perfect compliment.  The coleslaw, on the other hand, was lukewarm and soggy like it had been sitting out for a while.  Not something I want for my mayo-based side dish.  The onion rings were cold and chewy from being so cold.  I don't understand how they could possibly have cold onion rings if they're serving them with almost every meal.  Plus you get a whole 4 or 5 small ones with your food.  The soups in breadbowls were almost cold.  The stupid menu for the outside counter is very unclear.  It says ""comes with coleslaw, bisque, clam chowder, salad, onion rings.""  It *actually* comes with only two of those.  I was okay with paying $50 for everything on the menu + 2 drinks, but felt pretty ripped off when I got the tray and it was coleslaw and bisque.  I did have to get the Maine lobster instead of the local stuff, since they ran out, so that may have played a bit of a roll in the expensive bill.  But still, with the quality of what we got, the misleading menu, and the price.....I feel like they're trying to rip people off, and it worked!Oh, and thank God we didn't eat inside and have to pay extra for having a group of 8 and again for splitting a meal.  Did you know that a full lobster meal comes already split in half?  Charging $5 to put it on a second plate is almost stealing.",2 star rating,Andrew R.
5/23/2012,"Tempe, AZ","My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for the weekend and headed out to Stearn's Wharf. I had done quite a bit of research on the restaurants around the wharf area and this one had some really good reviews. Despite my initial reaction that a restaurant on the wharf and in a tourist area can't be good, we went ahead and decided to have lunch here.What a mistake!! My goodness, the food was just awful. I had a cup of the chowder which tasted like raw flour and pepper, mixed with some clams. Ugh! I also had the shrimp tacos which were equally bad. First of all, though they were not breaded, they were deep fried and tasted worse than the same offering from a fast food chain. The plate had pools of grease laying under the tacos. Just really really bad. The Spanish-style rice was just as bad - Rice-a-Roni would probably taste better. My husband had the cioppini, which is an Italian style fish stew. That was a slightly better choice - at least the seafood was edible. Also, I thought it was overpriced; with (2) iced-tea and tip, our bill totaled $50.00.My advice - STAY AWAY!! Btw, we had a lovely dinner at Le Petit Valentien (and it was only $20 more than the terrible lunch at the S.B. Shellfish Company!).",1 star rating,Renee j.

3/2/2014,"Anaheim, CA","Went one late night to try some of their clam chowder and fried clams. Both items had no flavor. Being that its Santa Barbara, I think sometimes due to the size of the area good food, isn't great food. There is not a lot to compare it to. It may be highly regarded because its close to the beach and its in a very touristy area, so you're already in a great mood and just enjoying the scenery, forgetting how not good the food is. Its like a Jedi mind trick, you are so happy to be walking on the beach you forget what real amazing seafood tastes like......Try Brophy Brothers, it is very, very good!!",1 star rating,Kate W.
9/12/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is so awesome! Besides having the nice sea view, the seafood they serve are simply the tastiest and freshest  like they have just caught from the sea! You can even see server carrying a live, big spider crab to customers at the table. Isn't that cool?We planned to have some steamed clams, clam chowder and maybe a seafood pasta as we saw many customers ordering. But we were quickly distracted by the rock crab on someone's table. So we go for it, and that was the best decision we have made on that day! Not only that the crab was big with lots of meat, the seasoning and freshness of the crab combined with precise cooking made the crab meat tasted like heaven! I can't help but cracking the shell faster and faster to reach out for the delicious meat that I couldn't stop reaching for... This rock crab special dish is really worthy at $23, and it comes with a salad and a clam chowder which is decently good but a bit on the small portion. Can't wait to go back for more crab meals soon..",5 star rating,Smiley H.

10/1/2012,"Sunnyvale, CA",Located at the end of the wharf there's a lot of places to sit outside to eat if they're full inside (which it most probably is since its a small place).  They have a take out/outdoor seating window off to the side.Menu is simple with all the usual seafood goodies.  Of course had to try the clam chowder and it was delicious!  Also tried the crab sandwich and it was not bad.  Wish it had more crab meat but I never really could get enough unless I made my own =)Beware the many seagulls and  pigeons that try to scooch closer and closer to you while you eat (outside)!,4 star rating,Esther S.

Normally I find places near the water to have fresh, albeit simple, delicious seafood, unfortunately it was not the case at this shanty by the sea.The prices were super inflated and not all of their seafood was fresh, which should have been the first major indicator that our group should dine elsewhere.I ordered the crab cakes, which arrived lukewarm and greasy; overall not very appetizing.

I also tried my boyfriend's lobster roll which was equally tasty. The oysters Rockefeller were large in size and so delicious!

I've not tried anything else there so can't comment on that.

I've got to try the onion rings. They are huge! The onion is very sweet and the battery is very crispy. Very well done..

7/8/2015,"La Quinta, CA","Went there last night for dinner, partly because it was on the water and partly because they allow dogs at the (4) outdoor tables. We had Caesar salads (ok, not great), crab cakes and shrimp tacos - both excellent. The only caveat is the wait. We put our name on the list at 5:30 and were finally seated at 6:30. People eating inside had a shorter wait, but still, it was a bit ridiculous. They could do a lot more to make the wait easier (like allow adult beverages outside, keep people posted about where they stood, etc).",4 star rating,Mary C.

4/19/2017,"Shanghai, VA","Tasty. Crowded. Picturesque.  On a pier with multiple selections of seafood restaurants, we chose this one based on the reviews. Heed the warning from other patrons...the location is small and there is a considerable waiting list for a table. Since we were interested in the food and not so much how we eat it, we ordered from the side window and ate our food on the outside patio tables. I ordered the cioppinno served in a bread bowl.  The flavor was delicious and there was plenty of seafood, including a rock crab claw, blue crab legs, shrimp, scallops, and mussels. My only problem with this dish was the awkward way in which I had to eat it without a shell cracker for the rock crab and how messy the soup was served in the bread bowl. 8 napkins were not enough to keep my hands clean as I ate. I'm assuming that if I tried the food served in the restaurant, it might have been a little smoother. My husband ordered the crab cakes and they were good...more. Ran than cake which is always a plus. I'd like to give this place another shot when I'm in Santa Barbara and see if there is a difference with the dine-in experience.",3 star rating,Lowell D.

I had one bite and gave it to my boyfriend who can't get enough food. It just wasn't good. We really enjoyed sitting outside with our couch and drinking beers while we dined.

3/27/2013,"Los Angeles, CA","This place is awesome. I've been here a handful of times and every time I've been impressed with the experience. Located at the end of Sterns Wharf, they do not take reservations, but have a sign in sheet on a clipboard when you walk up. There is normally a 30-45 minute wait (and no indoor waiting area), but there are ample things on the pier to do while you are waiting (such as grabbing a glass of wine at the Deep Sea Tasting Room or watching the people fish off the end of the pier). Inside and outside seating is offered and you can request your preference when you put in your name. The outside seating is booth style (better for kids and groups of 4 or 6), while the inside seating is on a stool at a counter and better for couples.The seafood is super fresh and fantastic. The large tanks of live shellfish and a good portion of the kitchen are in full view of the diners, so you can watch as the chefs prepare the meals. Most of the offerings, as the name implies, are shellfish, but they do have some bony fish on the menu as well. There is little in the way of non fishy items, so don't expect to see a chicken breast or hamburger on the menu. The locally caught crabs are fantastic as are the oysters. They also have a decent variety of beverages, both alcoholic and non alcoholic.",5 star rating,Robin S.

8/8/2016,"Temecula, CA","We ended up here because they were the only place that allowed dogs, so kudos to them for that. Most restaurants in SoCal allow dogs on the patio, so I was really surprised at how difficult it was to find a single place in Santa Barbara that took pets. Anyhow, food was so good we came back the next day as we were leaving town. We spent $60-$90 on lunch but got a ton of delicious, quality food. Coconut shrimp, onion rings, chowder, whole lobster, lobster pasta, lobster tacos, and oysters is what we had between the two trips and I would recommend any one of those things. I took off a star because the portions were inconsistent between the two days. Decent sized shrimp with 2 onion rings one day, and huge shrimp with a ton of onion rings the next yet paid the same price when one portion was obviously much larger. They have a take out window on the side so you can order your food and eat at the tables on the pier-food comes out faster than if they have a wait for seating.

When we came back, an hour later, we got seated at the bar near the door. I asked a waitress if we could change seats to a table on the other side of the restaurant and she said that she would check but never came back to us. I ordered the steamed mussels in white wine and my boyfriend got the crab sandwich. The sandwich was really good, like really good. The mussels however were heavily overcooked. I love mussels, it's what I order whenever it's on the menu. So this wasn't like a first experience I don't like it-type of thing. You also only got one slice of bread to with the mussels which is really unusual. Because we sat next to the door and they kept that open we were freezing the whole night, even worse our food got cold super fast because of it. When I went to use the bathroom the lock was a bit of a struggle. The person before hadn't flushed, it was urine all over the seat, they were out of toilet seat covers and soap.

5/7/2014,"Litchfield, CT","This place is OK. A tourist trap for sure, but what a spectacular spot right on the pier.  They have picnic tables set up outside perfect for enjoying SB's beautiful weather.  The food however is meh.  If you have a hankering for deep fried seafood, this is your place.  Coming from the East Coast, we have some killer seafood ""shacks"" and  less is more when it comes to fresh seafood.  We shared an order of the coconut shrimp which was second to the garlic clams that they were out of.  The shrimp were fat and succulent, but heavy with oil, as well as the onion rings.  It was served with a bright red dipping sauce that was watery and had he flavor of KoolAde-NOT GOOD.  After minutes of trying to figure out the artificial flavor that was so overpowering, we came to the conclusion that it was the juice from the bottle of Maraschino cherries.  The side of coleslaw was ok, very light on the mayo and sprinkled with pineapple and raisins. Refreshing against the heavily oiled shrimp.I glanced over at the crab cakes that my friend had ordered and it looked quite dense and heavily breaded.  This is not your Maryland Crab cake, which in my opinion is the best.  Why cover up the sweet rock crab that is literally pulled out of the fresh water a stones throw away?!!Granted I did not have anythings else here, but if you can't execute a simple fried plate of seafood, it may set the stage for the rest of the menu. It will curb your hunger while you take in the stunning ocean.",3 star rating,Pac M.

We used to go out to crab dinners twice a week, minimum. We were gonna eat at The Hungry Cat, but last minute decided not to since we have one of those here in LA. We came to the wharf instead and put our name in at Harbor Restaurant. As we were waiting, we walked over a few steps and found this place. It was totally opposite of Harbor...super casual, chaotic, tons of beer, onion rings, and of course CRABBBB. We glanced at the menu and saw 3 lbs of rock crab and a bowl of clam chowder for $23!!?!?!? Our jaws dropped. We totally forgot about our plans to eat at Harbor Restaurant and ate here instead haha. While we were waiting around to be seated they took our drink orders and we stood there drinking our beer and watching innocent crabs being boiled alive!!! I never thought i would actually witness it, but i did :( I was convinced that i wasn't going to be able to eat crab after watching it, but who was i kidding, haha. We got seated and started out with some chilled oysters and clam chowder. I don't like oysters, but i had one...only to be reminded of why i don't like them. Ugh, they literally taste like what you would expect the bottom of the ocean to taste like. On the other hand the clam chowder was reallllly good. I never get it in a bread bowl because soggy bread grosssssses me out haha. I know i know, i'm weird. I'm the kind of person who loves milk and loves cereal, but i have to have them separate. Clam chowder is no different. Anyway, there was tonnnssssss of clam in it, it was so gooood. However, i like my clam chowder REALLY thick and this one wasn't as thick as i normally like it, but i still loved every bite. Although the 3lbs rock crab was such a great deal, we just couldn't resist getting anything other than Alaskan King Crab. But still, 1lb of Alaskan King Crab, onion rings and cole slaw for like $25?! Omg such a great deal! We got 1lb each, which normally isn't enough to reallllly fill me up. But for some reason i couldn't finish! there was SO much meat in the crab we got, it was insane. And they gave us each a pair of heavy duty scissors along with the crab cracker and little fork, which reallllly made a difference. I don't think i'm ever going to eat crab again without some scissors, haha. But anyway, the crab was really good, as were the onion rings and everything else we had. Our bill came out to a little under $100 which was wayyy less than we were originally planning on spending. So that was cool.2lbs of Alaskan King Crab+Onion Rings+Cole Slaw+Clam Chowder+Oysters+4 beers= under $100?! You can't beat that. Next time we're in SB i'm sure we'll be back here again. I highly recommend it.",4 star rating,Amanda S.
8/23/2008,"Los Angeles, CA","I am definitely a fan of this place.  I went to this tiny little shack on 8/21/08 with my family.  My parents aren't usually a fan of non-Asian cuisine so it was a shocker when they wanted to try out the Shellfish Company.  Points for luring in my very Asian parents.  Even more points for not scaring them away with outrageous prices.  Everything was reasonably priced, with oyster shooters being only $2.50 each.  My bro tried one and loved it.  If you look at the shooter, it looks like someone just tossed the ingredients for a pizza into a shot glass and stuck a raw oyster at the bottom.  Hideously unappealing.  I guess looks aren't everything, huh?You MUST try their steamed rock crabs.  They charge by the pound ($6.50/lb), and they are fiiiiiiillled with delicious, juicy crab meat.  Those babies were hard though, and we had to ask the waitress to take them back and smash them to pieces for us.  The crabs came with marinara-horseradish sauce (soo good) and caramelly-butter (too buttery for me).  Be sure to look out for their specials...I think for $24 you can get a 3LB crab, soup, and cole slaw.  There were some specials on spider crabs too, but I didn't pay too much attention.One downside to this place is the wait...no, not for a seat, but for a waitress to come by.  The service was really slow even though the place was nearly empty.  We didn't even ask them to clean out the crabs for us so basically all they had to do was find us 3 crabs, toss them into the water, and serve them on a clean plate.  One other thing, the crab shells were caked with sand.  It put me off a little, but I will forgive them because the meal was pleasant.I originally was going to give SBSC 3.5 stars, but looking back on my experience I actually had a fun time sitting by the waters watching my parents suck the insides out of those cute chubby crabs.  They were so round and cute that I almost had trouble eating mine.  I wanted to keep it as a pet, even though it was obviously dead.  4 stars for you Santa Barbara Shellfish Company...4 stars!",4 star rating,May W.
8/15/2011,"Sacramento, CA","The rock crab was great.  Cooked well and had a lot of flavor.  Not over cooked and dry like some crabs I had before, so I was happy with that.  The oyster shooter was OK, but too much cocktail sauce and the parmesan added a little different flavor, but it all drowned out the oyster.  The chowder had good chunks of clams, but not the best I've had.Definitely will be back to get my crab fix, where it's low key and I can just crack and eat.",4 star rating,Jon S.

Seriously, a restaurant at the end of a peir surrounded by cotton candy and fudge shops... Tourist trap it is not! Several locals I talked to said this is THE place for crab and clam chowder, which is what I wanted. I ordered a two pound dungenous with clam chowder and it was extremely tasty. The crab was sweet, buttery, and cooked perfectly. Clam Chowder was full of bacon, potatoes, and big clams.You'll likely see a short wait here as the restaurant is very small and all counter seating.

It is located right on the pier which is something I love because you can enjoy the beach and the nice California weather while you eat some delicious, fresh seafood. Although it is a little pricey, you can get some good deals. I usually get the Rock Crab with a soup and salad for about $25. The caesar salad is good and both the clam chowder and lobster bisque are very good choices as well. The crab is very fresh and and soft, amazing to sum it up!

We found this place on the warf and it was seriously a debate as to what to order. Everything on the menu seemed so good and seeing everyone else's dishes come out before mine definitely added to the debate. Me and my boyfriend finally decided that it would be best to have the crab sandwich and rock crab special. So much good food! The crab in the sandwich is so fresh and the tomato and lettuce are so bright and it's absolutely delicious. The chowder is so thick and creamy, the way chowder should be and the onion rings are nice and sweet.

We got there around 5:15pm, and good thing we did, because after we put our names down, the line started to get way long. The inside is pretty small (only counters or bars) and there are about 3 tables outside. We got an inside seat, which is nice because it was starting to get kind of cold outside. We didn't have to wait that long to get seated, and the service was great.We ordered the rock crab ($25) which came with a soup and salad and the cioppino (which came in a bread bowl and another half a crab!) The food was so good that after the food was set in front of us, we did not talk to each other for the next hour until we were done. The crab was really fresh and super yummy and we were stuffed after eating it! The cioppino was really flavorful too. The boyfriend had two beers for $4.50 each, but the dinner came out to not that expensive for really great seafood.I think this would be a really great place for a date. There were also a lot of families there too, but it might be a little difficult to find seats for a bigger group. I would definitely recommend this place as a must-try place if you're in Santa Barbara. Even if there is a wait, you have the beautiful beach and ocean view to enjoy!",5 star rating,Stephanie S.

I'm not a local, but from living 7+ years in Tokyo & just being an overall snobby seafood prick, maybe my stamp of approval will hold some weight. SB Shellfish is the spot where I fell in love with cioppino. Every time I come here, I always seem to order it, even though I know there is a plethora of tasty sandwiches, crab, & pastas. So much seafood swimming in delicious marinara in a flavorful sourdough bread bowl! Plus they add some rock crab legs on the side! If you want fish, then you have to go to their big brother restaurant SB Fish Co. However, we were quite happy with sharing the cioppino, the shrimp ceviche, & the fried platter (oysters, shrimp, clams, squid, onion rings, served up with coleslaw). All washed down with the excellent pairing of the real San Francisco treat, Anchor Steam. For dessert we had oysters on the half shell from Fanny Bay, British Colombia.

Brophy Bros can give you more oysters for less and a much fresher taste.Rock Crab!THIS IS A MUST. You get a salad a soup combo with it as well. Its 3 lbs of a whopping local rock crab. The flavor was superb. Best $23 dollars I ever spent. I split it with my girlfriend and I was still full.Overall,I recommend getting whatever the daily special is. They'll always deliver and you'll save some money too. I heard good things about the beer-boiled shrimp so i'll come back soon to try that out.

We didn't have to wait too long, but when we saw that my wife's order consisted of just two very small crab cakes, a couple of onion rings, and a small mound of cole slaw, we couldn't help but be disappointed. My calamari and pasta, on the other hand, came with a decent sized hunk of sourdough, and the food pretty well covered the plate.To make matters worse, the crab cakes barely tasted of crab. They were gummy and flavorless, tasting more of filler  (bread crumbs that had been soaked in crab juices?) than of crab, and the onion rings were easily the bright spot on the plate. They would have been a rip-off at half the price, and warranted zero stars.The only thing that raised Santa Barbara Shellfish Company to two stars was my calamari pasta.

Alaskan King crab legs were very good & tasty, but I don't think they were alaskan king, there were pretty spiny & small, but still good. I love that they give you scissors for the crab legs!",4 star rating,Marisa R.
1/15/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","FRESH FRESH SEAFOOD!Twice in same weekend we ate here, skipped the long wait to sit inside and just ordered from the side window and sat outside - better view too! First visit, we ordered bowl of clam chowder (lots of clam meat), crab cakes (meaty, small size), and garlic baked clams (meat juicy, very garlicky, amazing dish). Second visit, we tried to get the garlic clams again but that dish was sold out for the day, so we ended with just a bowl of clam chowder and steamed mussels (delicious!). The portions are small and prices high, but remember all seafood restaurants is expensive in Santa Barbara and this place has it really fresh. Free parking with validation up to 90 minutes on the pier if you can secure a space, otherwise park on the street about a block from the pier. Definitely going to come back for more - especially for the garlic clams.",5 star rating,Calvin Y.

4/25/2010,"Salem, MA","I love seafood, and i love seeing tanks full of fresh seafood, usually a sign of a great restaurant, which knows how to prepare a good catch. this place was an incredible disappointment.issue #1 - please shuck oysters properly. it's hard, i know. i'm not very good at it. but take the time to notice when you shatter a shell, leave a few dozen shards in there, and lose all the juice of the oyster in the process. i love oysters, and i thought that these west coast beauties were slightly disrespected. what a bummer.issue #2 - the worst clam chowder i've ever tasted. even as my cohort had spoke of ordering it, hoping to get a taste of his much missed home on the east coast, i advised him against it. whatever they served him, in a mug, resembled a grey, peppered thick sloppy gravy mess. it tasted, as expected, like chopped up, luke warm clam gravy. any clam chowder out of a can is miles ahead of this travesty. ::hangs head in shame::issue 3 - beautiful scallops, and lovely fresh oysters. why such a heavy breading? to cover up the entire flavor of the beautiful fresh seafood that you have access to? only when digging through the doughy, less than crunchy batter, were we able to discern that these were really nice scallops, and large oysters (maybe gulf oysters though, not sure). i didn't even see an option for broiled or baked or flat top grilled scallops, which would have showcased the seafood a bit more.issue 4 - no need to fancy up abalone with pilaf and tomato sauce boys. it's fancy enough as it is. once again and similar to the batter issue with the scallops, we only enjoyed some very fresh abalone after having unearthed the seafood from its accoutrement.i think this place can do better, and hopefully i was just there on an very terribly off day.",1 star rating,jenilee p.
3/4/2010,"Brea, CA","After a walk on the pier, you end at Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.  Figured, why not! We definitely weren't disappointed.  Right when you walk in, you pretty much have your choice of seats.  If you'd like to sit inside, there are some barstools set up so that you can have a view of the ocean as well as some barstools set up facing the inside of the restaurant.  Outside, which is also open seating, there are a few booths that fit about 4 people.  If you've brought your dog along for the walk, many opt to sit outside so that you can keep Fido right next to you.  After sitting down, the menus are already on the table.  The menu consists of all things you'd expect from a seafood place on the pier - clam chowder, crab cakes, crab, shrimp dishes, fish and chips, onion rings - you name it.  I opted for the soup on a bread bowl.  Lucky me, their seasonal soup was LOBSTER BISQUE, my fav! The hubby went for the shrimp salad sammy.  I also ordered a side of fries (his came with onion rings).  The service was great.  The one waitress that seemed to be working seemed to be on top of her game.  Our food came out quickly, our water glasses were always filled, and she was able to anticipate all of our needs.  Can't beat great service!  The food was really good as well.  The lobster bisque wasn't the best i'd ever had, but did taste really fresh - it was by far not the worst either.  As for the shrimp salad sandwich - I didn't quite taste it, but he said it was good enough that he'd order it again given the opportunity.  I figure, all in all, a good meal.  Decently priced too - $35, including tip, for the soup in the breadbowl, a cup of soup for him, the side of fries (plate full), and the shrimp salad sandwich (which came with onion rings). Good stuff SB!",4 star rating,Michelle N.

So I recommend ordering to takeout, and eating at the tables on the pier (they are right next to the restaurant). The view outside and the ocean breeze makes the meal that much better.  We ordered the rock crab special (large rock crab, onion rings, soup and salad... great for splitting!) and a dozen blue point oysters. The oysters were delicious. I'd highly recommend getting oysters here because have a daily oyster menu that changes depending on availability and freshness. Too bad they didnt have kunomoto oysters that day. I got crab juice and tabasco sauce on me lol but it was well worth it :P So if you're going to Santa Barbara and you love fresh shellfish.

Why O Why o Why would they empty the best part of the crab out????  I was thoroughly disappointed and decided that crab is not CRAB w/out the brain part.Clam chowder....should have been delicious...but it was just OK. Kinda bland and very small portion.Oysters were fresh, but small and just OK.I honestly think that my favorite part of the meal was the side of onion rings that the crab came with.

5/30/2016,"Fullerton, CA","We tried this place based on the 5 star reviews we read on Yelp.  We got around 4 pm and there was already a small crowd waiting outside.  There was a clipboard hanging on a post outside the door so I wrote our name down for F/A (First Available seating).  We were the last name on page 2!  We did not have to wait long.  After about 15-20 minutes, we were called and seated right on the bar and could see the chefs cook.  Awesome!  This pleasant young man started to take our orders right away.  We started off with some Blue Point oysters, which they described as medium-sized, sweet oysters, 6 for $12.95.  We tried to order the Rock Crab special but it was sold out.  We settled for the Lobster sandwich and the Ciopino.  Our orders came out pretty quickly.  First, the oysters.   They were phenomenal! Very fresh and sweet. The Lobster sandwich came with coleslaw and 2 large onion rings.  My boyfriend and I split the plate, and thank goodness we did because it was very filling.  The coleslaw was very good, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they added pineapple tidbits to it.  I wish there were more onion rings though.  The lobster sandwich tasted really good just wished they put in a little more of the superb lobster salad to kinda even out the lobster to bread ratio.  The Ciopino was ok.  My boyfriend's mom cooks a superb Ciopino so our expectations were kinda high.  The Ciopino was served in a bread bowl with shrimp, mussels, lobster and clams.  I think I would have preferred if they served the Ciopino in a regular bowl with lots of bread on the side for dipping in the sauce.  The sauce just made the bread very soggy.  But I guess this is just a preference.  Maybe next time I can ask them for this switch.  It is a little on the pricey side.  The Ciopino is $18.95 and so is the Lobster sandwich.  Our tab was about $67 with tip. All in all it was a pleasant experience and I will definitely recommend.",4 star rating,Mylene O.
2/21/2012,"Anaheim, CA","LOVED it!!  Loved the mess, loved the food, loved the location.  I orginally wanted to get the cioppino but after seeing one of the cooks grabbing live crabs out of the giant tanks with his bare hands and tossing them in a huge vat of boiling water, I knew fresh crab was the only way to go.  We ordered the Rock Crab special (for $24.95: 3 lbs crab, 2 soups, it may only be a temporary deal).  It was a great deal and the crab was so fresh and sweet, it was amazing.  Not only that but you can really take some of your agressions out cracking those crab claws.  The clam chowder was good (a little too salty for my liking): very rich and creamy with big chunks of clam and bacon, good flavor overall.The location is very easy to find, just at the very end of Stearns Wharf.  We were only visiting Santa Barbara for the night and I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place.  Some of the prices seemed steep but c'mon people, the seafood is still alive until you order it.  Service was good, the waitstaff was knowledgable about the fresh seafood on the menu and they were friendly too.  Just be ready for a wait, there's only enough seating for 20 people inside and maybe another 16 people outside.  So just put your name on the list and enjoy the ocean and Santa Barbara coastline views.",5 star rating,Kandice S.

9/11/2010,"Whittier, CA","I needed to take a lunch break while I was on my way to Morro Bay, so I took out my handy iPhone and went on Yelp.  The reviews insisted the food was orgasmic, so I decided to come here.When I opened the door, it looked like I would suffocate by just sitting in this place.  I'm more of a fan of fresh air.  It looked like a long wait.  But who cares?  There was a gorgeous view from the pier. I ordered (outside) a clam chowder in a sourdough bowl for $9, a shrimp and scallop caesar salad for $13, as well as a fried calamari, scallops, shrimp, and oysters platter for $13.  The man did not hand me a reciept.  Just a number.  You have to pay close attention because the guys taking your order expect you to wait on him like a dog next to the window.   So, I just leaned my back to the wall and watched people take all the tables that were several yards away.As I read in The Glorious Oyster, Oysters are the most tender and delicate of all seafoods. The stay in bed all day and night. They never work or take exercise, are stupendous drinkers, and wait for their meals to come to them.  Well, then I am an oyster.  I DON'T LIKE BEING WAITED ON.This would be pretty frustrating for somebody who was eating alone because when he picks up his food, there may be no tables available.  So he'd have to wait ten to twenty minutes just to get a table.  Don't get me wrong.  This wouldn't stop me from getting some kickass seaFOOD because the FOOD is what I came here for, right?.But whatever.  I did find a table, but by the time I did, my salad had already cooled down.  It tasted pretty good though.  The clam chowder was hot, had plenty of clams, and wasn't too thin or too thick.  The fried dish was fried to perfection!  Not too greasy, so that's good.3 stars for the service, 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance.  (3+4+5)/(2)= 4 STARSNow why did I just do that?",4 star rating,Bobby B.

Salad was pleasantly delicious, soup was kinda bland (lobster bisque). Now the rock crab? Boy oh boy it was fresh and it was DELICIOUS! Yes, I know all that Dungeness is excellent and the seafood snobs in CA get uptight about it. And we FL stone crab snobs will tell you that neither crab can hold a candle to stone crabs, but let me tell you that fresh red rock crab is 90% as good and 30% as costly as stone/dungeness.Regardless of comparisons, it was a delicious meal and the presentation was A+. If I lived in SB, I think I would eat rock crab fairly frequently. For being in a super touristy area (wharf), I'd give them high marks.Yum!",5 star rating,Mike M.

This go round I didn't opt for the crab because it was for a snack.  The other parts of the appetizer platter were not bad as well.  The onion rings, shrimp and scallops fell in the same average category.  Overall this is a great place, but long lines and wait for food.  Either in the restaurant or eating outside.",4 star rating,Kent H.

I've been here half a dozen times now and it just gets better and better with each visit.Love starting out with a tall hefeweizen (they have excellent draft beers) with an oyster shooter or two.  For dinner, the specials are usually the way to go... like half a grilled lobster with onion rings & cole slaw for around $20... or local whole rock crab with chowder & salad for $23. They also have HUGE local spider crab and dungenes crab on hand most of the time. I LOVE their lobster bisque, fried oysters, and steamed mussels in white wine & garlic.

However, on my third visiting, I found out your secret. Simple food such as a boiled crab or fried calamari (food that you don't need complicated seasoning) is good to eat here, but others are under average. Though I understand that you want to create special fancy dishes, it works the opposite way as intended. Sadly, there are not so many choices of drinks and they don't have cocktails or sweet wine, so I have to drink some juice or water with crabs. Man... Their service and atmosphere? There is nothing to mention about that. It's like a fast food place on the pier. As long as you order only crabs, you will feel this place is a 3 star place. If you make a big mistake at picking out your food, you will be disappointed by a 1 star place.P.S. DO NOT ORDER THE LOBSTER TACOS!

The food is very good. We've tried their clam chowder, clams and mussels dish, crab sandwich and bolied crab. They were all very good but the crab was very fresh and mouthwateringly tasty. I tell you, I did not leave a single part of that crab without eating all of its meat. 2. The service is exceptionally fast and the crew are very nice, attentive and pleasant. They move fast. They check up on you and quick to refill your drink if needed. 3. The price is very reasonable. 4. The location is great. They are right at the end of the pier. My boyfriend and I rode our bikes there and it was very convenient and close to many stores. The place is not big so you may have to wait. I suggest coming in early before the crowd and sign in your name on a clip board hanging outside the restaurant. You can also order from the outside.

4/7/2013,"Philadelphia, PA","I don't even know, man. My experience of this place just was not that good. The service = BAD. When my friend approached the server asking him how long the wait would be, he rambled off, did not answer the question, and walked off. I understand the place can be pretty busy, but bad service is not the answer. After waiting about 30 minutes, we were seated. I ordered the cioppino and my friend ordered a crab sandwich and the lobster bisque. -lobster bisque: delicious! It was very flavorful without being overly rich and saturated with cream. Totally worth a try. A cup should suffice as a little starter-Crab sandwich: totally not what we expected. The crab was sandwiched between two small slices of sourdough bread. It looked small, and looked like something we could just make at home. My friend said that it was pretty good, but she seemed underwhelmed.-Cioppino: $18.95 It was an impressive sight when the server brought my dish to my table. I had some really tasty bouillabaisse, and cioppino sounded like it would hit the spot. The dish arrived in a bread bowl with broth dripping over the sides of the bread bowl. I could see the mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallop peaking out from the broth. And what was definitely noticeable was half a crab sitting next to the bread bowl. The broth was good, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. It's definitely tomato-y. I believe I had like 3 mussels, 3 small clams, 3 shrimp, and 3 baby scallops. Meh, it's not that much, really. Since they spilled the broth over the sides of my bread bowl the outside of my bread bowl started to get really soggy and lost its sturdiness. The crab was very difficult to eat! I was successful in removing the meat the last time i had crab. this times I was quite a failure. Shell was flying all over the place. I dropped a decent chunk of leg on the ground. I'm still in mourning. I wish they had provided me with scissors or something to make it easier or a better gouging tool or something. By the time I got to the crab, the crab got cold. (I don't like cold sea food. personal preference alert). It was incredibly difficult to flag down the server. When the aforementioned server who shunned my friend's question about the wait time came, I asked him for the check and a moist towlette. He did not bring either. So we had to have another go with another server. Kind of frustrating. Overall, I think I could get better seafood elsewhere, and I could do with better service.",2 star rating,Jean J.
8/25/2016,"Glendale, AZ","We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.",3 star rating,Wendi G.

6/29/2010,"San Jose, CA","Part of me really agrees with Oliver D.'s review and part of me agrees with the other reviews on the SB Shellfish Company - what it all boils down to is your preference.The shrimp ceviche was super chunky and had more large prawns in it than small bits of shrimp - I prefer Bay Shrimp in my ceviche, not prawns so really this just a different preference. The taste of the ceviche was pretty good, but need more finely chopped cilantro, onions and tomatoes. For a little over $10, the value was very poor - half of the ceviche was served with cabbage shreds on the bottom and the tortilla chips did not taste fresh.The small cup of clam chowder my father ordered was also eh-okay because it came out more brothy than creamy. Being that we are both San Francisco natives, we expect clam chowder to have a creamy consistency and this place just didn't fit the bill. With the money you would save by NOT eating at this place, you would have enough gas money to drive to Pismo Beach and getting some real clam chowder at Splash Cafe.",3 star rating,Jenny B.

And the prices are reasonable as well. I had the rock crab special - it was a full crab + half a crab, salad and a cup of soup for $23.

We started with the coconut shrimp which were jumbo looking shrimp with good tasting coconut but was lacking the sweetness. Also the sauce they gave with it was like a raspberry coulée. I prefer red lobsters piña colada like sauce. The cole slaw wasn't your typical it had pineapple and raisins in it and the cabbage was really crunch with not enough mayo. I got the lobster roll. The roll was plain with not even butter or toasted. The lobster pieces were good sized but I didn't like the mayo caper combination they mixed it with. Just ended up eating the lobster and left the rest of the sandwich. The onion rings were only partly coated and lacked salt. My friend got shrimp pasta which was good and had a good wine taste. Wouldn't go again. Think it's more of a tourist trap. The coolest thing about this place was the live crab in the tanks lining the restaurant.,2 star rating,Linda V.

4/30/2009,"Brea, CA","Here's a true story that should get a few laughs from y'all or at least get some of you to click the funny button...My gf at the time (now fianceé) and I took out some crab from SBSC one night of a stay in SB for dinner and took it back to our hotel. When we got back, we realized we didn't have anything to break the claws, so we jury rigged any blunt objects we could get our hands on in our room and started bustin' claws caveman style. Apparently, the folks a floor down didn't take too kindly to us making that much noise and had the front desk send someone up to our room. Imagine our surprise when the guy comes to the door while we're trying to get our grub on and asks us if we know anything about a ""banging"" noise with a weird expression on his face. I guess the downstairs guests thought we were gettin' busy rough-like or something, cuz this guy was pretty much scratching his head when he looked in and saw crab shell scattered all over our coffee table. We were just trying to have dinner, Mister! lol. We had a good laugh after he left and tried to quietly finish our crab.SBSC has excellent quality crab, lobster, and whatever else they have live in the tanks or freshly caught that day. One time, my dad, gf, and I polished off a spider crab at the tables outside. That was awesome. Another time, I had their California spiny lobster (in season Oct-Mar) and it was grilled to perfection. Whatever you have here, it's best when the weather is cooperating and you're able to eat at the outside tables and enjoy the beautiful scenery. I don't think I've ever eaten inside the restaurant, either because it was too nice out or the wait inside was just ridiculous, but the point is, come for the food and you won't be disappointed.",5 star rating,Jimmy N.

Its was so delicious and it went very well with the beer selection ;) We also had a few oyster shooters and raw oysters that were unbelievable! The customer service is fantastic, very attentive but not pushy at all. Its not as large as other restaurants but its cozy has a nice view of the water and you can sit outside if you want.

Our server, Jennifer P, was attentive without being overbearing. The only minus about this restaurant is the limited amount of tables outside (4) and the small amount of tables inside (bar like) that are rather crowded. You can, however, order at their walk up window and sit on the picnic benches outside. Probably no bar service there though. Great seafood!",4 star rating,BranandMike G.
5/11/2010,"Phoenix, AZ",When traveling on Hwy. 1 in California it only makes sense to take advantage of the fresh seafood serve along the way. I wanted to find a place that had that costal vibe and good food. The Santa Barbara Shellfish Company fit the bill perfectly.The boyfriend and I  walked out the end of Stearn's Wharf on a chilly evening hungry for some steamy seafood. We bellied up to the counter where the woman working was friendly right off the bat. It's a small place with only a handful of seats inside. We were glad to get indoor seating because as the sun was setting it was getting cold out. It was nice to get a little heat off the grill from where we were sitting. And the classic rock music playing added to its crab shack atmosphere.I ordered the crab sandwich and boyfriend ordered the shrimp tacos. While we were waiting for our food we watched the crabs and the abalone move around in the tanks. The waitress even brought an abalone over to us so we could watch it up close.My crab sandwich was so good. Big chunks of fresh crabmeat served on toasted bread with a side of onion rings. Yummo. Boyfriend's shrimp tacos were good too served with a side of spanish rice.This place is the kind of little costal eateries found in novels about living or traveling seaside. It's perfect for a vacation or if you just want to feel like you're on vacation. I wish I was eating there right now....,4 star rating,Holly R.
8/29/2010,"Los Angeles, CA","Dinner rundown- clam chowder was good- seafood was fresh- plenty of food!  Good for sharing- wait was ok but it was a bit cold. :(My coworker and I found this place while on travel. I selected this place because of the clam chowder review. I had it in the bread bowl and he had it in the cup. The bread bowl didn't make me too happy but the soup was delicious!!  I had the onion rings and they were a bit too greasy for me. Not enough breading??  I also had some baked clams which were good until I bit into a sandy one. :(. Aside from that one, it was very good. Coworker had an oyster shooter.  First time and he seemed to like it. He was a bit confused on how to eat it. The nice waiter gave him a few pointers. We ended up ordering a few more dishes that were not as memorable but there was more than enough for the two of us.I believe that I didn't get the full experience because I didn't get one of the crab or lobster's sitting in the tanks. In all, great service and great food. Must go back there again.",4 star rating,Jenn S.

7/31/2011,"Long Beach, CA","Unimpressed! We went here based on the reviews but were very disappointed.It's not really a restaurant, more of a walk in shack. There are only bar stools to sit on inside and it's cramped. You can sit outside, which is nice but not what was expected.I had the coconut shrimp and they were just O.K. The shrimp had an odd metallic taste to them and the coleslaw was underwhelming. My husband ordered the crab sandwich and it was completely bland. We added some salt and it was better but still pretty flat. The crab was all ground up and unrecognizable, you would think a place touting fresh, local seafood would use lump crab. We both tried the chowder but it was thin and too salty. A real bummer since we both love chowder normally.It was a $50 lunch and we didn't enjoy anything we had so it was a real let down. :-(",2 star rating,Leah W.

For starters we ordered the local Morro bay oysters $16.95 per half dozen today, it was really delicious and fresh and well worth it. We also ordered the rock crab special which comes with caesars salad and lobster bisque(or clam chowder) for $24.95 it was a good deal,the crab is 3 lbs.  Overall the food was good. Seating was slow although it was not too full. Also,bar style seating throughout the interior,no regular tables and seats,so a tad bit difficult to get into eating the crab,not too comfortable.

9/13/2011,"Santa Barbara, CA","Came here for dinner tonight. I called around 6:30 and they said there was no wait. When I got there around 7, there was a wait.I've never been here before, but I've been on a seafood kick. Arch Rock Fish definitely did not suppress my craving for seafood. It enhanced it. Waited a bit at SBSC and did not know that there weren't any tables inside the restaurant. My companion and I waited around 20 minutes before being seated at the bar in between 2 families. My companion is 6'4 so I let him take up most of the room since I'm only 5'1.We ordered clam chowder bread bowl ($8.95), fried seafood combination ($12.95), and the local crab special ($15.95).The clam chowder was good. I usually don't drink cream based soups, but this had a ton of clams in it. It wasn't too creamy, which was good. I added some Tobasco to give it a little kick. A good balance of clam, potato, celery, and bacon in the soup. Normally, at other establishments, there aren't clams but a ton of potatoes. A FACADE!!! I wish the bread was warmed up, though. Next the fried seafood plate came. It consisted of oysters, shrimp, calamari, and scallops. It came with a side of coleslaw and onion rings. Everything was fried perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. They were good! And the fried oysters were HUGE! I'm not a fan of fried oysters, I like them raw. Their cocktail sauce is SO good.  Overall, a very good dish.Lastly, we received the local rock crab, steamed and not cleaned. It also came with onion rings and coleslaw. I think the best part of the crab is the head. It's where all the juices are!! We spent a good time getting the crab flesh out, but it was worth it! The meat was tender and sweet. For $16, it's a good deal!There were only 2 servers working at the restaurant and they did a good job of getting our refills and attending to everyone.The place is small, but it had a good atmosphere and the restaurant smelled good! The aroma draws you in, but it doesn't smell seafoody.Reasonable prices and good food is all that I'm asking...and it's not that hard! Spent around $50 including tip and we were satisfied. We also spent that same amount at Arch Rock Fish and we had to get pizza afterwards since it wasn't enough food!I have been searching and have found what I am looking for!",4 star rating,Felicia C.
8/2/2007,"Orange County, CA","I give this restaurant only 3 stars because the main dining room smelled like the bathroom. The cioppino, salty, and ceviche, bland. BUT I did like the location as well as Hubby's lobster dinner. I wish ordered it too but he was savoring every bite of it and hardly shared with me. We had an outside table next to the water, seagulls and pelicans in plain sight. It was very romantic. I had a good time nonetheless, and will make sure to order something else next time.The neat thing is for those patrons that cannot wait for an outside table, they have a to-go window.

7/27/2011,"Irvine, CA","There's a bit of a wait if you want to sit in the restaurant.  However, you can order from the side window counter and eat your food at any of the picnic tables on the wharf.  That's what we'll do next time.However, during this visit, our first, we did the 20 minute wait for a table in the restaurant.  We ordered the Rock Crab Special which is a whole crab plus a cup of clam chowder and a side of Caesar salad for $24.95.  The crab is delish.  The meat is plentiful, it tastes lightly sea water salty, meat is slightly sweet and cooked just right. We also ordered half a dozen of Blue Point oysters.  It's been years since I've had fresh oysters that I approve of not since Santa Cruz about 10 years ago.  The oysters here are good.And, ordered the shrimp cocktail.  I thought it's very good but wifey knocked it down a point since the shrimp is not as big and crisp as the ones we had at Longboard Grill the night before.  I thought they were par for course.The clam chowder though was definitely better at Longboard Grill.This is a must go to place if you like fresh seafood at the wharf kind of place.  I don't think you can find this type of restaurant at the wharf in SF or Redondo anymore.  They all turned into tourist traps.  This place is still authentic.  To me it is anyways maybe because I am a tourist?",5 star rating,Ed M.
1/9/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","Biggest crabs I've ever seen. Sit at the bar and watch your lunch go from the aquarium to the frying pan. The clam chowder was excellent and the steamed local crab was meaty and delicious. This place is small so expect a wait for seating, and the walkup window doesn't seem to shave much time off the experience, so put your name on the list and wait. The name doesn't lie; only shellfish here, but excellent quality and excellently prepared. My girlfriend didn't like the bloody mary, but I don't like them anyway. Not a place for large groups, mostly barstools inside with 3 booths outdoors.Bottom line: the best shellfish on Stearns Wharf.",4 star rating,Mike C.

We ended up not waiting to be seated and just got it from the ""take-out"" store they had at the side of the building. There are definitely too few tables in the restaurant for the amount of traffic they get. Good thing is that the stall sells the exact same stuff on the menu so we got to save on tip!Oysters Rockefeller. Baked oysters with spinach and cheese. Pretty good. I don't usually get to eat oysters baked with spinach so I thought it was pretty good, but I wish it was more flavorful. It reminded me of eggs benedict a little, but even eggs benedict had more flavor than this. Dungeness Crab. With Onion Rings, Cocktail Sauce and Butter. It also came with a clam chowder. Yum! I liked the crab a lot it was really sweet but a little on the small side. At least it's local! It tasted really good dipped in the sauce and butter. Clam Chowder. I thought it was okay, since I love clam chowder so I tend to eat it a lot. I thought the clam chowder was thick and salty, but at least it had a lot of clams and potatoes in it which I like. I wish it was creamier and less salty though.",3 star rating,Constance P.

The food was fresh, service was on point, and the prices were great. We're so glad we decided to stop for a lunch break & walk all the way to the end of the pier to give this place a try before heading on up for some wine tasting. The rock crabs were ridiculously huge and although the shells are tougher to crack than the dungeness crabs, the meat was yummy & worth the effort. The inside of the restaurant is small, very casual & a relaxed place with bar like seating & stools. There is outdoor seating with a few tables for those who want some fresh ocean air. On our way back down from wine tasting a couple days later we decided to try out the Hungry Cat since we still wanted a seafood fix. Lets just say when we left the Hungry Cat we were still...well...hungry! So we drove back here to order more rock crab, shrimp, and this time another 1.5lb of lobster! For half the price of what we paid at the Hungry Cat, we got 2x the food and better quality here (IMHO). The folks next to me couldn't believe the gluttony and had to do a double take when the lobster came...but oh...so worth it. We sat at the bar this time and watched them flame broil my lobster and baste it with butter.

5/30/2009,"San Francisco, CA","This restaurant is at the end of the wharf. Indoor seating is dark and cramped, so we opted to sit outside. Despite the evening chill, the heat lamps kept us nice and toasty. The waitress knew what she was talking about and made excellent suggestions. We ordered the rock crab and maine lobster, which each came with a large Caesar salad and clam chowder. The chowder was delicious and aromatic, with a decent proportion of clams to potatoes. We had one and a half rock crab -- my husband had the half, and I started on the whole. Unfortunately, the whole crab was not only more difficult to crack, but after all that work it was flavorless. My husband says the half was much better, but my experience with the other crab was disappointing. The lobster claw was great though, very tasty with butter. The raisin slaw was delicious as well, and the onion rings were a nice addition.We had a great view of the water and saw some magnificent pelicans up close.

8/13/2010,"Glendale, CA","Was looking for some good seafood on Stearns Wharf, and this place caught my eye. It was fairly crowded, so we had to wait about ten minutes to be seated. The inside smelled a little fishy (lol), so we decided to go instead to choose the outdoor seating and ocean view. PLUS! Though it got a little windy, it was nothing that a cup of tea couldn't easily mend. Waiter was very nice and helpful, checked on us enough times to earn the 'good service' nod. Ordered myself some Fried Calamari, Oysters, Shrimp, and Scallops, which is basically your choice of one, two, three, or four of these shellfish favorites, served with coleslaw and garnished with onion rings. Mother ordered herself some Shrimp Scampi, which consisted of shrimp sautéed in white wine, butter, and garlic, served on a bed of rice. Both of our dishes were under the Favorites list on the menu, so we really expected to be blown away. However, that was not  the case. My entrée (the assortment of deep fried shellfish) was alright at best, I expected to be more impressed. The calamari tasted fine, a little bland even with the sauces on the side. Same goes for the shrimp. The scallops tasted good with a hint of hot sauce, but I couldn't stand the oysters. Maybe shellfish isn't meant to be fried? Overall, it was just unnecessarily oily. But, I was hungry and it filled me up. The Shrimp Scampi was overwhelmed by garlic. Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, I'm not a hater at all, but this specific dish used so much that it was almost to the point of repulsion. The shrimp was at its normal state (not fried), but still tasted bland and unseasoned. At least the onion rings were delicious! Food: Two Stars. Although our food was overall unimpressive, I will give this place the benefit of the doubt with three stars, seeing as so many others before me gave such rave reviews. I will, however, say that the ocean view, cool breeze, and fresh air is unbeatable.",3 star rating,Mari H.

We got some oysters for appetizers and they were good as always, can't really fuck up on the half shell unless you give us bad oysters and we spend the next few hours on the toilet. I'm sure that's the exact image you wanted when thinking about food, my apologies. Anyway, they had a blue crab special so we got that and the cioppino. Both were fantastic, the crab was some of the best crab I had and the cioppino was crazy tasty. However it came in a bread bowl and most of the delicious broth absorbed into it and you couldn't eat the broth without eating the bowl and that's just too much bread so if you can get a regular bowl to enjoy all of it.

Fresh caught seafood at its best! Got a 1.5 lb lobster, comes with salad and coleslaw. They boil it, split it, put it on the grill to finish and give it such a tasty flavor, then serve it up with drawn butter. Am I drooling? You betcha!",5 star rating,Goldi J.

I sat on the edge of the bar in plain view of all the cooking action and I learned that about 1/4 cup of butter gets finger-scooped out of a tub and is added into the pasta dishes...no wonder they taste so damn good! They have super crab cakes here too and the coleslaw isn't shabby either. For a touristy spot, I have to say they aren't resting on mediocre, they are doing a fine job!",4 star rating,Bridget W.

9/11/2012,"Los Angeles, CA",Went at about 630PM on a Fri night and it wasn't busy AT ALL! We were only 3rd in line and waited about 15 min before we got seated and we specifically requested outdoor because I had my dog with me. I ordered the rock crab special which comes with a caesar salad and soup (clam chowder). The clam chowder was delicious! I had the best clam chowder in Seattle but this was just as good! The salad didn't have as much dressing as I would have liked. The rock crab was DELICIOUS! It was my bf's first time trying rock crab and he fell in love and he wanted to go back and get rock crab every night during our stay in Santa Barbara! We also got the shrimp and scallop pasta which was soooooooooo goooooooooooood. Everything was just perfect and they even brought out a little cup of water for my dog! :) Probably our favorite restaurant we ate at during our whole stay!,5 star rating,Nari L.

But the waiter was a little on the rude side (I won't reveal his name), but the GROSSEST part of our lunch was when I went to the bathroom and our waiter came out of the restroom (there's only one), I went into the restroom and he DIDN'T FLUSH!!!!!!I mean seriously, that's DISGUSTING!

3/9/2015,"Glendale, CA","Couldn't forgive ourselves if we went to SB and didn't try this place. We aren't huge seafood eaters so definitely didn't order the huge crabs you can watch in their tanks while waiting for your table. Yeah, there's gonna be a long wait no matter what. Just prep yourself for that and dress accordingly. We were seated inside (there are stools and a counter--that's it) and the seating isn't comfortable at all. You're rubbing elbows with your neighbor and can hear all of their crunching and munching and slurping, but by the time you get seating it won't really matter. You're starving! We ordered the oysters on special (Kusshi--yum!), Calamari sandwich, Crab cakes, and Clam Chowder. All were really good. The crab cakes were on point. Flavorful, not too briny. I ordered the calamari sandwich because I tried some really good ones that are popular in Madrid, and it had me longing for another. I watched the servers bring out crab to some of my neighbors. What a stunning presentation. They give you a pile of claws and legs and put the HUGE crab body on top of all that. And some people take it home as a souvenir. Pretty funny.",4 star rating,Trisha T.

Ordered couple of iced teas and water ( very hot day) then we got a grilled shrimp Caesar salad and the mussels. Food came quickly enough, both Dishes pretty good. I give the food a solid 3. Our server was john and he was great! Kept the water and teas full, which is saying a lot. I had a minimum of four. Refills ( said it was hot) which John took care of without asking! Blows me away. Always checked back and brought extra bread for me to lap up the mussel broth. To top it off john brought us two teas to go when he brought me the check! Outstanding service.",5 star rating,Bill P.

Good soup, excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge, plenty of crab for one person. They had great service, beautiful location (it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating). The only reason I give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood. My poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food.

Let's talk about food - it was OK nothing amazing. Okay maybe the crabs are fresh but it end there full stop. First time I came here had the calamari. If anyone is following me you would know how I am a bit of a calamari fan. It was over cooked and tasted like grease. I didn't get the delicate flavor. Had it as one of the choice with scallops and oysters - yuck. Had the pasta - so-so. Had their sandwiches, nothing special. Had the lobster, man what a rip off!Service - OMG! some of the waiter/waitress are SOOOOOOOOO rude. I don't know but as I was leaving the last time I was there. The very, very rude waiter was harassing a mother (with a baby) inside the restaurant accusing her of cutting the line and wasn't suppose to be in there because no one called her. Poor lady, her English was very good but she said they called her name. Management if you are reading this you better screen your waiter because this is ONLY reason why I'm not going back there which is unfortunate because I have been talking about this place with my friends from out of the country and I just told them to find somewhere else after this experience. One star for location. That's about it.",1 star rating,Pink G.

Neither of us had eaten lobster bisque or oysters before, but we both thought both were delicious! Lobster originated on the east coast and was priced accordingly. The rock crab was much more reasonable and too much food for me to finish. We were splurging for our anniversary (we don't do formal) and sitting at the bar chowing down on shellfish was the perfect meal. We will be back!

They quickly told us they were out of the local crab and suggested the Dungenous crab (which is double the price) Wanting shell fish from the shell fish restaurant, we ordered it. When the meal came and we started eating, we immediately noticed the crab was flavorless, dry and seemed old. The clam chowder was ok, the bread it was served in did not taste fresh.

It is about 3 lbs for $24.95. You could share it with a dining companion...but you'll be happier if you each get your own.The trick to this place is to come when it's not crowded--that means no sunny holidays or even most of the summertime.

9/28/2013,"Santa Maria, CA","The scallops were way over breaded and the French fries were a greasy mound of over seasoned and over battered spuds. Chowder was starchy with few clams to be found.  When on Stearn's Wharf in Santa Barbara, go elsewhere!",1 star rating,C C.
10/4/2014,"Whittier, CA","I read good reviews about this place so I wanted to give it a try. I think over all it sounded better than it was. I did like the fact that it's all about the food but the items I ordered fell a little short. I also read that the bloody Mary's were great so I ordered one. It was not great, in fact it was just mediocre, so I ordered a cold corona after that. The oysters were great but as long as they're fresh, they're going to be great. We had a san ysidro  shrimp cocktail. Sauce came on the side - it was basically a salad of mixed greens with avocado and poached shrimp. I ordered a lobster roll since it was on the feature board and I had read that it was really good. It was flavorless and not at all what I expected. The lobster rolls at Hungry Cat are bomb! This one was not good. The clam chowder is average, nothing special. The service was ok but everyone is nice. I like this place but food was nothing special.",3 star rating,Laura P.
11/3/2012,"Long Beach, CA","First time here and was not disappointed.  The dozen of oysters were super fresh and the waiter Everett kindly explained which kind we got, but I was hoping for house-made cocktail sauce and horseradish.  The server was very attentive and checked on us frequently.  Ciopino was great - seasoned just right with big crab, shrimp, clam, scallop, and muscles. This was very good but the muscles tasted a bit off.  Shrimp ceviche was very good and juicy but I wished the corn chips they were served with were also house-made.  We waited for about 20 minutes to get seated but didn't mind as we were not in a rush.  Overall experience was great but could have been excellent 5 stars if some basic elements were more original and freshly-made.",4 star rating,Anna L.

You have a choice to sit outside, at the bar, or facing the window but if there is a big crowd and you don't care, choose first available. If you're a social type and like to watch the cook, server/bartender in action, sit at the bar. Cioppino does not disappoint but it gets messy. Seafood is fresh. Clam chowder is tasty. If you don't wanna wait for the restaurant, order at the window outside and sit at the windy tables outside, the seagulls and pelicans will join you for chow.",4 star rating,Phil A.

10/9/2012,"Alhambra, CA","We selected this place because of the high Yelp ratings.  Unfortunately, I'm bummed out that of all the places we could have gone for dinner..we ended up here. Very disappointed with the experience.To find this place you have to walk all the way to the end of Stearn's Wharf which is no big deal because we were already there.  By no means is this the only restaurant in the area but since we were on the wharf I pulled it up on Yelp and it had many, many favorable reviews. So we thought...let's give it a shot.  Upon arrival, you place your name on a list hanging from the post just outside the entrance to the restaurant.   You can indicate eating indoors, at  one of the few tables outdoors, or first available.  We were in no rush and it was a nice afternoon so we opted for outdoors.  The restaurant is very small with even fewer tables outside. Service was below par.  The waiter even apologized and self-admitting he ""forgot about us"" after leaving us for 10 minutes and not returning to take our order.The menu is typical seafood with specialization in crab and lobster. My two kids were with me and unfortunately their taste buds aren't at the level to pick from the menu. I asked the waiter if they offered a kids'  menu...they got three choices chicken dinos, grilled cheese sandwhich, or pasta. I opted for the crabcakes and my husband for the shrimp tacos.I wish I had read Steve I's review...I couldn't agree more with his description of the crab cakes.  I would assume that if you are calling a dish ""crab cakes"" that there would be some crab in it? Maybe?  They were a mushy mess.  Could not find lumps of crab nor taste the crab.  I won't complain about the skimpy size since it would have been a complete waste of ""food"".  The ""crab"" cakes came with a garnish of onion rings and a side of coleslaw.  The chipotle aioli tasted more like thousand island dressing.  On to the shrimp tacos.  Anyone who has had baja style shrimp tacos knows that they are breaded. In fairness to Sta Barbara Shellfish Co., the menu did not state they would be breaded.  According to my husband, they were just ""aw-right"".  From my vantage point across the table his plate did NOT look appetizing.  A side of box quality spanish rice to complement the tacos?!  The best thing about this place?  Getting the heck out!!!Overall, never coming back.",1 star rating,Rosie H.

9/23/2012,"Newtown, CT","Right at the end of a touristy wharf so a not so touristy seafood restaurant with very attentive service and delicious food.  We ordered the fried seafood combo and the rock crab special.  The deep fried oysters were MASSIVE, the largest I have ever seen.  And very sweet and juicy.  It took me 40 minutes to eat the single large 3lb rock crab. I like to pick through all the legs and area behind the legs.  They did an excellent job cleaning it and breaking the claws and top of shell in just the right places to get things started.  I also liked that they offered the option of two clam chowders rather than a salad and a chowder so I wouldn't have to order an extra chowder for my wife.  I don't remember our waiter's name, but he was one of the most attentive waiters I've had in a long time.  Very good experience and reasonable prices unlike the seafood restaurants in New England.",4 star rating,Chick R.
7/26/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","It's good food but be careful what you order. They usually have a special advertised outside. Read the fine print, it's tricky. Cost us like $200 for a lunch, because of that I wouldn't recommend or go back.",3 star rating,Trish G.

8/31/2012,"Rowland Heights, CA","We are on vacation here. After having read reviews of the restaurants near Stearns Wharf, I decided to try this restaurant.It's located at the end of pier, a small and casual place. I signed up on the clipboard at the door for being seated. The special of the day was on a chalkboard just below the sign-in clipboard. It was a Friday night and there was a free outdoor movie right next to the restaurant. We waited abut 15 min and were seated at the bar, facing the kitchen.  I loved it because I could enjoy chef's action.We ordered Oyster shooters, steamed claims, the special of the day Hardback shrimp and opinion ring, a paired with Pinot Grigio. It was the first time I tried the oyster shooter which wasn't bad. The claims were steamed with white wine sauce. They were a little bit over-cooked and the juice was a little bit sour. The hardback shrimp, OMG, they were delicious! They were cooked in salted water, accompanied with ketchup. We ate the shrimps without the ketchup. The natural flavor of the shrimp was preserved. They were tender and tasted of sea. The big fat onion rings were crispy and fresh. I regretted that I didn't order more shrimps. They also had crab, lobster and farm abalone. I'll try abalone the next time.The environment was casual. Our neighbors sitting at the bar offered to take video clip of us drinking the oyster shooter and picture of us with the food.  The staff was friendly and efficient.This is the place I'll go back and recommend. Tips: if you don't want to wait to be seated, you can order takeout. There are picnic table and benches just outside of the restaurant. The line is definitively shorted.",4 star rating,Wei L.
10/13/2014,"Boones Mill, VA","I was sorely disappointed in this place, especially given the multiple 5 star ratings. It wasn't particularly busy tonight but it was beautiful outside so I opted for the service window and sitting on the picnic tables overlooking the water. I ordered the cioppino and a side Caesar salad. The salad wasn't why I was eating there and it wasn't anything impressive. Just a typical romaine lettuce, dressing, Parmesan cheese and a few croutons. The cioppino was impressive at first glance. A large plate with a bread bowl overflowing with the tomato-based broth and a lot of visible seafood, including a half of a crab. While I realize that a 'traditional' cioppino is served with the shells intact, considering the very thick shell of the crab it took considerable time to try to crack and remove the meat. Which caused the soup to become cold. I like a warm soup. It's why I order soup. All of that aside, there were quite a few mussels and clams, but only one scallop, one shrimp, and no fish. The bread bowl it was served in seemed stale, even dunking it in the broth didn't seem to help that. It was simply a disappointing meal all around, but the service was quick and very friendly.",2 star rating,Lori S.
8/28/2012,"Boulder, CO","I wanted to like this place more. Great location at the tip of Stearns Wharf. The lobster bisque wasn't very flavorful, and had more of a watery, chicken noodle soup consistency. The Santa Barbara shrimp cocktail was just OK, but didn't Wow me. Total bill was $20-21. Not really worth the price. If eating at the outdoor picnic tables, don't leave your food for a second. The seagulls are pretty aggressive!",2 star rating,Ihno L.

Literally filthy - dust, crud on the counter, on the windows, unbelievable stench (not fish or food - but like dirty wet rugs).Food quality is pretty bad: burnt crab cakes were pre made and microwaved to order - hence still cold inside. Soup - barely warm and clumpy, onion rings - way undercooked, their famous crab - boiled in plain salty water, no spices, no flavor. And the presentation of the dishes - nothing like on the pictures posted here. Very sloppy, unpleasant.Don't buy into the advertising - the place is not worth your time or money.

7/7/2005,"San Francisco, CA","This delightful dining spot is perched at the very end of Stearns Wharf, with magnificent views of the islands bobbing in the sea a short distance away. Quite by chance, we chose the perfect time to dine here, and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise, followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline. With the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us, it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal. It was late in the day and, having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing, we were ravenous, so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense New England style clam chowder. We followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels, served in a white wine and garlic broth, every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty French Bread, and then splitting an order of calamari, sauteed in butter, garlic, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini. Including tax and tip, we stuffed ourselves for only $17.00 each! The very nautical decor and bustling open-air kitchen add to your dining enjoyment. There's a long bar (where food is also served) that seats a couple of dozen, and a massive aquarium - with water pumped up from the ocean below - houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters. Other waterfront spots in Santa Barbara easily will cost twice as much for a far less satisfying meal. If you're looking for seafood, this is THE place to eat while in town.",5 star rating,Gourmet G.

I don't know maybe we were really tired and hungry but I thought that the service was just ""okay"" not bad but not great either. When you first get in you have to sign in but after we signed in we kind of just stood there not knowing what to do because no one came to check the list. So after waiting for awhile, one of my friends just decided to ask someone and that was when we were seated. We decided to order 4 dishes and then share just so we can get a taste of everything. The portions in my opinion were a little too small for my liking well for the price. But I guess it is seafood so it kind of makes sense. The food did taste pretty good so no complaints there.

Much smaller and rustic than I imagined, waaaay more casual then I thought, which happened to be a good thing since the impromptu visit to SB had us in jeans and flip flops.There were only about 14 seats at the bar and about 20 along the one side of the shack.

It is generally too chilly for outside sitting but if you come prepared the view is great! Inside is very shack-ish. The windows were kind of grimy and you can barely see the crabs in their tanks, but it's all part of the shellfish companys charm! Mussels in white wine garlic was delish!Clam chowder  in bread bowl, was one of the best I've ever had!Crab cakes were good, (I have had better at the grill in westlake village)...The coleslaw however was meh.

2/3/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Great experience - touristy or otherwise. Our server was fantastic. He was kind enough to share a current Groupon promotion that we could redeem for our meal. This place is located at the end of the Santa Barbara Pier. Total seafood market/restaurant feel. Seating is limited so the wait can get pretty long. Fortunately, my husband and I arrived during a time when the wait was only 20 minutes or so, but as we were leaving the restaurant, the other guests mentioned the wait being close to an hour & a half. You basically put your name on a clipboard located at the front door and the server will call your name to seat you. Hubby & I both got the cioppino. I think the food was great & fairly priced for the amount of seafood you get. This isn't five star fine dining so I don't quite understand the other bad reviews. The place gets busy & has a constant hustle and bustle feel. We sat at the bar & got a first hand look at the ONE cook who jams on the stove!! It was great to watch your food being prepared in front of you as you enjoy a cold one! Hope to return to try other items on the menu!",4 star rating,Sherryl C.
3/6/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","2 of us came here on Monday at 1pm-day after the (now famous on youtube) storm hit MobyDick rest. just in front of Shellfish co! Since it was not the weekend, got seated right away at the bar-there were 2 other spaces empty in the whole of the inside! We started with the local mussels which was in a fennel broth - the mussels were very tasty and the fennel broth was simply delicious! We then shared the 3 Ib RockCrabs which came with a cuppa clam chowder and plate of caesar  salad. The clam chowder was surprisingly not ""heavy"" with lots of clams which tasted fresh-very tasty indeed! The crabs were huge and very tasty as expected! Also had a glass of bloody mary which went well with the seafood. Total cost incl tax was $50-which was quite reasonable indeed! Service was fast too and liked the ambience/layout as well as we could watch the action as well as see both the mountains as well as the beach from the inside windows sitting at the bar!",5 star rating,Renuka V.
4/11/2012,"San Gabriel, CA",Previous reviews hit it right on the head.   Hands down the best place to eat on pier.  You wouldn't guess it by its looks because so tiny but the line of people waiting says it all.  The rock crab is amazing and fresh.  A must if in SB.,5 star rating,Alejandro F.
1/20/2012,"Phoenix, AZ","The best clam chowder can be found here, I love clam chowder and have had many good chowders from all over, a few I even thought to be the best, but this by far is the winner.  Definitely plan to come back for a bowl or two. We also tried the fresh local spider crab, also delicious, we split a 5.5lb one between three along with the 2 soups and 2 salads that come with it (priced at $9/lb). I have never had spider crab before so it was very different. The shell is much more thicker and tougher than a typical king or snow crab that I'm used to, tasted different too. It most definitely is fresh though, there are tanks filled with live crab, it is a very rare opportunity for me to have fresh live crab, living in Phoenix and all. They also have fresh live abalone to, something I have never tried before, but i'm told it's delicious.",5 star rating,Lizzie F.

He took great care of us and even noticed and took care of things that were out of his and the restaurant's control. If this review was about him he'd get 5 stars. The reason I'm not giving a 5 is because all the food was bland, which was quite disappointing. As far as pricing goes, you pay for the view, so one can't really complain about that...",3 star rating,M B.
6/4/2009,"Los Angeles, CA","Why does this place ROCK?-Clam Chowder: Absolutely delicious.. especially with the bread crackers they give you! I don't even like clam chowder but I ended up stealing half my friend's chowda. Sorry dude!-Local 3 lb. Rock Crab: My favorite. 5 stars! Surprisingly, there were lots of meat to be found and it tasted very fresh.-Fresh Maine Lobster: YUMMM. Also very delicious. I saw the cooks boil the poor live lobster right in front of my eyes. It was a bit sad and terrifying to see, but hey! I knew I was getting fresh live lobster alright!!)-Nice view by the harbor. My friends and I took some pictures outside, and just stared out into the harbor with the winds blowing in our hair. Nice pensive atmosphere.-Service was great, but we came at peak lunch hours so we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. They really should make more seats available outside. Seriously! Especially because people don't leave for a LONG time trying to find all that meat!! (-1 star)-Ample Parking available nearby the front of the restaurant. I believe you can get it validated by eating here.Just make sure to go early to avoid the crazy long lines during peak lunch hours.

Had the lobster special which is boiled and then grilled to give it extra flavor. I really enjoyed it. There's also a decent selection of beers here as well which is  plus.

8/24/2013,"Van Nuys, CA","Located at the end of the pier, it's a small shack with outside seating along the pier. The décor is a bit reminiscent of Jaws meets Sponge Bob. I actually came on Weds night but found that the wait was too long and the weather too cold. I came the next day about 2pm and found there was only a 10 min. wait. However the most important thing is the food. I ordered the Rock Crab Special & 1/2 Maine Lobster Special - both found on their chalkboard specials. They came with soup & a Caesar salad. To be honest, I didn't touch the salad at ALL. Nothing bad, just not interested. The crab came out beautifully red, with the empty cleaned shell right above the meat to complete the presentation. The meat was so good!!! Moist, soft, melts in your mouth with the addition of lemon/ lime & butter. Lobster was the same as well. Cracking open these shellfish, eating, and sharing with a loved one was a memorable & yet a fun activity during a meal. Just keep in mind, you might get a tad messy. People complain that the price is too expensive. Just so that you know, there are fishing boats that LITERALLY will drop off their catch around 6-7am so I think the price is really reasonable. And if you don't believe me, just check out their tanks full of those live critters",5 star rating,Chris K.

They don't taste like ""crab"" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).clam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too ""fishy"" which can happen with clam chowder.We saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!some notes: -The indoor seating is limited. It's a small ""shack"" at the end of the pier.

The shrimp cocktail seemed a little over-priced compared to the rest of the menu and the value. We had the local crab which was ok but really barely had any meat on it.

9/6/2010,"Baltimore, MD","I'm not usually a fan of eating crab anywhere except home. It's usually much too expensive, for food that isn't that tasty. And here on the west coast, they swear by their dungeness crabs, which are the larger but less tasty version of the blue crabs we have on the east coast.But I was thoroughly impressed by the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company. The wait was about half an hour, and we sat outside where it was quite cold. The heaters solved our problems though. The lobster bisque and salad were your standard fare, nothing spectacular.But the special was 3 pounds of rock crab, for $23. Not cheap, but for the amount of meat you get in a rock crab, pretty damn worth it! We basically spent an hour and a half straight digging through our rock crab, picking at the big chunks of delicious meat.Sitting outside means the waitress doesn't stop by too often, but to be honest, there's not much you need to ask for. When you have an enormous crab in front of you just waiting for you to dig in, there's only one thing to do. Chow down!",4 star rating,Kevin T.

Their special rock crabs are pretty good too but i think the Alaskan king crab they have is way better. the last, the Lobster pasta is must to order, they use garlic, wine , and other sauce to cook that pasta.

If you dont mind getting your hands dirty, get a full crab of any kind...so good! Pull em right out of the tanks and they are on your plate in minutes.  Pasta w/ shrimp and clams also excellent, as are the $2.50 oyster shooters. They have Maine Lobster as well as local crabs of various types.  Beer and wine only (decent beer selections), but they can make Bloody's with rice wine instead of vodka.  Like another reviewer mentioned, if u love shellfish, this is a place to plan a vacation around.  Please open a place like this in San Diego!!!",4 star rating,Jeff F.

And I have to say that they do a great job with lobster - it is among the best I've had in a restaurant. I do love clam chowder, and sadly theirs is only so-so. If you like crab, it is a good bet.

We opted for the restaurant's take-out window on the side of the building and ate at the outdoor picnic tables.I had the coconut shrimp, a couple of onion rings and a cup of chowder. My husband had the combo with scallops, calamari and shrimp with a couple of onion rings. Both of our seafood was warm and flavorful. The onion rings were cold and not very good.

My husband and I visited this little cute place this past weekend. it was our second visit since last year. We started with a cup of Clam Chowder, WOW... very tasty! I had a bowl of Cioppino. it came out with a huge mix of sea food in a large sour dough bowl. A fresh cooked half crab lay on the top. There were LOTS of sea food in this bowl...manila clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop, and the soup base was thick and had so much flavor. It deserves a solid 5 star. They also serve great beer and wine. My husband had lobster tacos that were just tremendous. Service was excellent! If you are lucky to sit at the bar, you can see how the delicious food is made with many flaming burners! We will go back for sure. We had so much fun to watch our food  cooked, and really enjoyed the food and drinks.

7/12/2010,"Phoenix, AZ","As a first timer to Santa Barbara the first thing I wanted to do when I stepped off the plane was to get my hands on some fresh seafood.  My friend had been to the Shellfish Company before on a previous trip and couldn't stop raving about the fresh seafood at this hole-in-the-wall place on the pier.We left our hotel and trekked all the way down to the end of Stearn's Wharf, once we arrived we wrote our names on the clipboard (read: hostess) outside and waited.  We got lucky (as far as I could tell afterward, very lucky) because we were seated within 20 minutes.  Once I entered the place I realized how lucky we were since the entire restaurant seats about 30 people!We debated for awhile between the 3lb. Rock Crab that was on special for $24 and the Alaskan King crab.  We ended up going with the Rock crab on the advice of our waitress and we split it.  Along with that we each got a soup with our meal.  In addition, we ordered the fried shrimp and calamari appetizer.  The soup was good- being from the east coast and traveling to Boston I have pretty high standards for my clam chowder, and this stuff was good, but nothing to write home about.  The appetizer was great and the fried shrimp was unusually impressive- they were large and had a nice batter on them.  Finally, the crab came and we went to town.  It was undeniably fresh and was definitely enough for two people given the soup and appetizer.Shellfish Company is a great idea for out of towners to get their hands on some fresh catch.  However, you have to be cognizant of the tight seating arrangements (either at the bar or along a counter) as well as the long wait that's associated with having such little capacity.  It will however, give you great food and a hometown, local feel.I'll definitely be sure to return for some crab the next time I'm in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Kelly W.

The weather was beer appropriate, so we decided to stop by Santa Barbara Shellfish Company which was located at the very end of the wharf. Walking in, we were right away greeted by my favorite crustaceans: crabs. I salivate. These creatures were HUGE! There was a spider crab the size of my purse in one of those aquariums. So we found a spot right away, ordered a cold one and as I look up to the menu board, saw IT; ""Rock Crab Special $23.99"", Hellz yeah! I got me some of those! Solid local rock crab. They crack the shells for you so there's not much work involved. Crab was steamed to perfection, sweet and meaty. It came with clarified butter and 2 other sides, but who cares about those when you have a huge-ass crab in front of you? It also came with a clam chowder, and that was very good.

We wee seated outside which we usually do not do BUT it was so nice out, and the table had a heater above keeping the cool sea breeze at bay. My wife had a half Maine lobster, with a caeser salad and she loved it. She very rarely gets lobster but said it was really fresh and tasty. I had steamed clams. 38 clams counted!!!!!!!!!! In a broth of wine,butter,tarragon with a chunk of really delicious sourdough bread. I am not a huge bread person but this was unreal sour and crunchy and delicious. I had steamers at Slys the night before and had way less(under 24)and paid way more and they were nowhere near as tasty as these. I followed with stuffed clams. These were not shells stuffed with a few chopped up clams and breading. They were full sized littlenecks cooked intact with the parmesean topping baked on after the clams were cooked. I have never had stuffers done this way. AWESOME!!! We plan on returning later for dinner now also. Thanks Land Shark for the recommendation!!",5 star rating,Steve R.

4/5/2012,"Santa Cruz, CA","My husband and I were excited to come here for a date night. We got seated quickly. We ordered a plethora of fried seafood (fish n chips, calamari, coconut shrimp). I would have to say the calamari was my fave. The fish n chips is breaded vs battered and the coconut shrimp was okay. The places was good and the prices were reasonable. Only downside was that we were on a date and wanted to take our time and savor the night. Unfortunately the food came out so fast we were out of there in 20 minutes! We were still looking at the menu when the appetizer came out. Literally 5 minutes after we ordered our food arrived. Then as I was finishing up our server was breathing down my neck to clear the table. She was really young so I'm assuming she wasn't keen enough to space the orders out and maybe she just really needed to work a more tables that night. The place wasn't even crowded though! Anyways, that was the only downside.",4 star rating,Alice S.

Crab cakes for appetizers (cold, had much better at other restaurants), 5. Lobster tacos (very average) Our waitress was o.k. with us  however We noticed she was rude to  others.

6/27/2010,"Redwood City, CA","We were craving seafood. My boyfriend and I went for where after 120+ reviews, there was still a solid 4 start rating. At the very, very end of the SB pier is Shellfish Company. A small, low key, non-assuming restaurant with live crabs adoring their windows. After a brief 10 min. wait on a Monday night we were seated. We decided on  1/2 dozen oysters, bowl clam chowder, shrimp ceviche, and cioppino. Oysters and shrimp ceviche were fresh, pretty run of the mill but good nonetheless. But the dinner really started with the bowl of clam chowder we shared. It was a perfect creamy but not too thick consistency, with the just right amount of salt to bring out the taste of the fresh clams and potatoes. Add some pepper and Tabasco and we were fighting over it. Until the cioppino arrived. They have perfected the recipe for this. A bountiful medley of mussels, clams, shrimp, and crab in a slightly spicy, pipping hot bread bowl of tomato amazingness. I love that they served it so hot the bread just went soft and gooey to the touch. The service was good, food was mouthwatering - the whole experience left me in a dreamlike state.",5 star rating,Kristine T.

6/3/2007,"Woodland Hills, CA","I stumbled upon this shelfish shack last year when I was in town for July 4th weekend and immediately I was hooked. This place is small and located at the end of the pier, parking can be a problem sometimes, but I guess you can valet it up front or wait it out. When you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them. I always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder; absolutely the best Ive had thus far. They also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well, apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits. Overall you can try alot of different fresh shellfish without paying as much as you will other places offereing the same items in their menu. Now that I write about it ... I think Im going to go today ..",5 star rating,Shawn Y.

4/7/2009,"North Hollywood, CA","Where to begin.. Messy toilet, no hand towels, non-functioning hand dryer; for one. A cold and rainy day compelled me to request they close the frickin door, but as soon as they did that, they opened a window that blew an icey draft right at us; for two. Third let me finally get to the food. I guess $25 for a pound of Alaskan isn't a bad deal, but it makes it hard to swallow - literally - when it's the fishiest, dryest, and saltiest crab you've ever eaten. Oh, and the onion rings mentioned as part if the 'meal 'deal"", if you will, amounted to a grand total of TWO. When a dish comes with a side of let's say rice, you'd expect more than a couples teaspoons of rice, right?  If you charge me 25$ to sit in a cold messy shack and eat ""crab legs with onion rings"" I'd better get a BASKET of onion rings, and how about some bread too? Even the cheapest seafood restaurants won't let you leave hungry, but this one did.",1 star rating,Matthew L.

There are like 4-5 tables outside with heaters since it was cool (68 degrees) and breezy. I got the halfdozen oysters, cup of clam chowder, and steamed clams.

We cycled over the uneven wooden surface of Stearns Warf pier (bottles of recently purchased white clinking together in the front of my basket) to find this little gem of a restaurant perch at the farthest corner of the pier. I wanted to try everything on the menu but my body failed me. I worked hard to try as much as I could though. (Will have to condition my body for the next time I visit). I started with the urchin over scallop and served on top of a slice of lime. Drizzled soy sauce over, was delicious. (That is on their specials board.) Went on to eat a crab sandwich which was also very tasty, with huge crispy onion rings. A few crab claws later a foodie smile appeared. I then helped finish off my wife's Cioppino dish, which was equally divine. Served in a  hollowed out loaf of bread, the juices get absorbed into the bread and it is yum for the tum.Fresh local produce. Our server was so helpful, bright and enthusiastic. TipsIt can be windy at the end of the pier and if you sit outside it maybe a good idea to put an extra layer on.It is possible you will be queuing up to be seated (it is very popular) be patient, it won't take long and the food is so worth it. Maybe call up to find out how busy they are before.Be prepared they may have run out of certain things. It is in fact a good sign everything is fresh.Next visit I am going to eat as many Parmesan encrusted garlic clams as possible - the large steamed crabs - the coconut shrimp and maybe squeeze in the lobster roll.Why do we not have anything like this on the water in Miami?!

This place has it all: good oysters, actual pieces of clam in your clam chowder, good local beer on tap, and an aquarium of stuff you can eat. Don't know how this place can miss. Oyster choices were all native to West Coast so you can taste the difference between the different regions they were plucked from. Staff was attentive and kept the beer flowing. Definitely suggest sitting at the bar to watch your food be prepared right in front of you. They also have outside dining in case you're there on a beautiful day. We loved this place and will always come back for more.",5 star rating,Joe E.
11/6/2016,"Hemet, CA","Great place to eat! My wife had the cioppino with pasta and I had the lobster roll with onion rings.The cioppino comes in a bread bowl but they substituted the bread with pasta. It was served hot and was delicious! The bowl was crammed with mussels, shrimp, sea scallops and a king crab leg. Loved it!My lobster roll was nothing to write home about. Bland on flavor and very salty. The meat was minced and unrecognizable as lobster. However, the onion rings were crazy good! Fresh onion wrapped in a light and flakey batter. The service was great and our server, Sam, was very nice. We'll be back!",5 star rating,Mountain M.

Everything was delicious. I was really looking forward to the rock crab special, but they ran out. With that said, try and get there before 4p to ensure you try their signature dish.Their seafood gets delivered daily. Yep! Their fisherman pulls up and drops off the goods. Also, their tanks containing crabs and lobsters have ocean water being pumped in from below. Doesn't get any fresher than that!Overall, great food, not overpowering with too much flavor, but just right. Ever, our waiter was patient and checked in when needed even though the place was imploding with people. We ate a lot, drank a lot, and only paid 73.00.I'm definitely coming back!

We then saw the side window which you can order food from. We ended up ordering oysters and clam chowder. The chowder was great. The oysters were really big but still good. It would have been nice to enjoy those oysters with a Bloody Mary but we didn't feel like waiting in line so the side window was great!,4 star rating,Matty C.

2/28/2013,"La Mirada, CA","I am often not impressed with these fish joints on piers places. However, the Shelfish Company is the exception to this rule.  It sits at the very end of the pier in Santa Barbara. I believe it is called Stearn's Warf. FYI-Beyond the restaurant, the pier has no railings so if you have kids with you, be careful.  Or if you have to much to drink, you can go in the drink!My wife and I shared the fish tacos and the sampler platter(I think that is what it is). The tacos were really good. The sampler platter was good as well. We had a lil bit of everything. Fried calamari, shrimp, oysters(which were interesting).  We also had Ceviche which was great as well. Also, I have had clam chowder at a lot of places, Monterey being the best, but the Shellfish Company's rivals the chowder in Monterey. There are only 4 tables outside. This is a very small place. I would highly suggest getting there a bit before noon or you are going to be waiting a while.  We waited about 40 minutes, but it was worth it.  While you are waiting, you can enjoy a beer outside. Only beer and wine are served here.  The inside is small and much more like a bar than a restaurant.  The service is good as well. These touristy type places can be hit or miss on service, but the Shellfish Company has it down.So if you are in Santa Barbar and want to get off of State street, go to the Shellfish Company, but stay away from the side of the pier. lol Remember, don't drink and dive!",5 star rating,Bill S.

1/1/2019,"Thousand Oaks, CA","Had a late lunch there around 3:00 PM. They were still packed and had to wait in line. Ordered the rock crab, clam chowder, and the lobster tacos. The rock crab was well cooked, cleaned, and prepared. The clam chowder came in a bread bowl. It was good, but not mind blowing. The amount you get in a bread bowl is pretty small considering it was $9.95. But the lobster tacos will change your life. Best I've ever had. Generous amount of  tail and claw meat, great aoli, perfect amount of vegetables. It is worth the visit.",5 star rating,Steven F.

3/8/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","At the end of the pier, this little shellfish shack had a lot of promise. The food items, however, were hit and miss.Since the place only has ~10 seats inside and there was a loooong line (even at 2 pm!), we ordered from the takeout window (to the left) and seated ourselves at the picnic tables on the pier. They holler your number from the window, and even with the wind, were really easy to hear.The food was good, but not fantasmic. The crab cakes were crispy without too much breading. The clam chowder itself was great, but the sourdough bread bowl it came in was pretty dry. The cole slaw was really unimpressive. Overall, if I was down at the pier, I'd probably give some of the large pieces of shellfish a try. I also had my eye on that lobster roll....",3 star rating,Stephanie B.

Orders Cesar salad, dressing was great but the lettuce was mainly the rib and limp. Our entrees were lobster roll, crab cakes, and shrimp and scallops pasta. The lobster roll was on a French roll which we felt was too dense of a bread complement the lobster. Maybe if some of the inner roll was removed it wouldn't feel so thick and dry. The shrimp and scallops pasta lacked flavor. The scallops were too under done. The crab cakes were the best out of all things ordered. They were a bit dry as well but the dipping sauce made up for it. It was experience but I wouldn't choose to return.",3 star rating,Latoya M.

2/7/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Stopped by after a long day visit to Santa Barbara. There were few different places near by but remembering that 'smaller place with limited menu' has 70/30 chance of being better than a big place with big menu. It's generally a good ratio to keep in mind, and depending on the category of food, like sushi, it leans to a higher ratio like 80/20. Other places may have better seating and views, but I believe this place has better food. Their clam chowder was the best I've had so far in California (been here only for 5 months, I'm just getting started). Their 2 options of fresh oysters were good choices. Their lemonade was good and sweet. I just wished their shrimp cocktail came with more ...Cocktail. (Easy fix, just ask for more)",5 star rating,matthew c.
2/5/2016,"Rolling Meadows, IL","Not worth the wait!My husband and I stopped here on a driver up PCH. My Dad actually had told us about a fish place in Santa Barbara on the pier that we had to go to. We looked up restaurants at the end of a pier and thought with the good reviews, it was this one. As we were waiting for a table (you add your name to a clipboard outside and wait)- it's very small inside with only stools for seats (all at the counter). My Dad texted saying that when he went they only had male waiters, no females. This was my first clue we were in the wrong place. The waitstaff here was mixed: men and women and I could tell by the casual dress this wasn't the place he referred to. We were there, however- so decided to wait. It was quite cold, so we took a quick walk down the pier for some hot cocoa and walked back. In that time, of course, our table was called. We let them know and they had 2 seats ready for us at the counter. My husband decided on the lobster tacos and I asked the waiter how he likes the crab sandwich- his response made me question instead about the calamari sandwich, to his reply was- it was amazing, or something equally great. I ordered that.We also split some bisque soup (it was okay, we were expecting better being on the pier and all).My husbands tacos were rubbery and overcooked. My sandwich was barely there, not a lot of meat and small. My husband took a bite once I was on my 2nd half and asked what I ordered. I told him the calamari to which he told me- this was crab. I guess I was so hungry I honestly didn't notice. It didn't taste very crabby either- I tasted a lot of bread. Everything so far was incredibly bland. We called the waiter over and I asked him what this was- he said the crab, to which I let him know I ordered the calamari and he stated that he wouldn't have said the calamari was excellent, because it was the only thing he doesn't eat on the menu. He asked if I wanted the calamari-, I said yes. So when that came out- it too was quite bland, I was kind of fed up. Putting the sandwich down I saw a hair on my plate. My husband called the waiter over and he said he was sorry and took the hair off my plate (leaving the plate there)- and asked if I wanted another one. I said no and he walked off. However, I felt that he didn't stick around long enough to ear that I didn't want the plate with the hair on it either! I wouldn't waste your money here or your wait time. Test out another seafood company with good reviews- this is bland and did I say not worth it?",1 star rating,Kate D.

Chowder was hot, drawn butter was yummy and I liked the blue cheese & ranch too.My special was the 3 crab claws for $14.95, no sides.  It was plenty and filled me up with the cup of chowder.  I suggest you go here sometime in your life time...its the Jewell of Santa Barbara when it comes to seafood!!",5 star rating,Karen J.
5/8/2011,"Tustin, CA","This is the place to come if you're looking for some awesome, fresh, sweet, tasty seafood.  So, why 4 star?   The wait, AND the waitress FORGOT about us.   We didn't want a seat near the door because it was 8:00pm at night and it was cold.   So we were willing to wait for another sea that's more inside the store.  So, it's gets a star off for that.  My bf and I came here after we had already eaten dinner, but the SUPER LARGE CRAB look so COOL that we decided to have a 2nd dinner. We learned that the crab was called the ""spider"" crab, and that was what we decided to order.  Honestly, we ordered because it looked cool and we wanna to be cool, and show off to all of our friends on facebook.   The crab came with soup and salad, which was just o.k.  The salad is kind of like a ceaser salad, but does not have a ceaser dressing.  We had a choice between claim chowder and lobster bisque, where we both chose claim chowder.  I thought the chowder was good, but not great.  I had a better chowder elsewhere.  Now the main course, the crab, so BIG!!!!!  The body was as big as my head.  I was excited to take lots of pictures, but wasn't as excited to eat it.  I knew we couldn't have finish it since it was 6 and half lbs.  I was hoping the meat wold be sweeter, but it wasn't as sweet as I excepted it.  It was really really really good, but not excellent yet.  I guess I at least got my money worth by taking lots of picture of this crazy BIG CRAB.",4 star rating,Rosemary T.

Local crab special includes a cup of clam chowder or lobster bisque and a side salad. Lobster bisque was a bit bland.  The clam chowder was good but not fantastic. The crab was very sweet. The oyster shooters with vodka is a definite must. It had two fresh oysters in a shot glass with tomato juice with a spicy kick, Shredded Parmesan cheese, and finished it by lacing the top with vodka. Best tasting shooters. My only wish is that the shooter was a little colder. Here's a suggestion, keep the vodka in the freezer, and they pour like a syrup, and the shooters will be nice and cold.",4 star rating,Adela B.

12/10/2012,"Santa Barbara, CA","I like the shellfish company.   I have fond memories of enjoying a sunny Santa Barbara day sitting at a picnic table in the sun eating shrimp tacos as we watched the bombers drop retardant on the Tea Fire a few years ago.   If you are going to live through the terror of a fire it is best to do it in paradise where you can eat shrimp tacos!   For some reason I don't think of going to this place all that often.   Recently a Groupon was what it took!   It was a good deal.   $40 coupon for $20!    Since the 1/2 Maine lobster was $18.95 we could have lobster dinners for only $9.50 apiece!   Can't beat that.    The fact that the lobster was a little on the small side didn't matter, it was under $10!    The guy who served us was great, don't remember his name but he was SO enthusiastic and nice.   Sometimes when you pay with a Groupon the server treats you poorly and that kind of defeats the purpose that the owner of the business had in mind when they chose to offer their food for a discount to raise awareness for their restaurant.   It was nice to be pampered and it really makes me want to come back--with our without a Groupon! Had some Chowder with the Lobster and a beer.   The Chowder is pretty good but not quite as good as Brophy's across the water in the Harbor.   I have had the Lobster Bisque before too and wasn't a fan-too fishy!    I like the Lobster Bisque at Enterprise better.    All in all this place defines a four star review!   Couldn't imagine giving them only three.   If they had a full bar instead of just beer and wine one could almost justify five stars!",4 star rating,Douglas M.

Very little lobster in the tacos and the cream salsa was way over spicy inedible. The Spanish rice was not at all fluffy. It was hard and beyond dry. $80 for poor food is upsetting. The service was slow and un -attentive. Again, very disappointed ! I will need to find another seafood place",2 star rating,Gianna S.

9/7/2015,"San Francisco, CA","Major disappointment. The cioppino was gross -- overseasonsed and in a bread bowl that managed to be both soggy and stale at the same time. The mussels and clams in the dish were not cooked sufficiently for the shells to open, so they were inedible. The crab was stringly and unsatisfying. The raw oysters we ordered were marginally better, but nothing special. At least we didn't get sick.The outdoor line moved like molasses -- there were around 25 people ahead of us, and we waited nearly an hour for food. You can do so much better at some of the restaurants downtown, like the Hungry Cat -- it has much better fresh seafood at similar prices, and without the wait!",1 star rating,David C.
4/14/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Came while visiting  SB on the recommendation of our friends.  I was worried that the place might be a tourist trap since the reviews were either very good or pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised.We arrived at least 20 minutes before the other two in our party, but the servers were wonderful and very accommodating and allowed us to save four seats even though only two of us were present and we never felt rushed.  I had the half lobster, which was delicious, and I thought a decent value.A nice spot to grab a drink and some seafood!  The service was very nice, is why they get a full five stars!",5 star rating,Ruby Y.

We did have to wait 13-15 minutes for a waitress to finally come by to ask if we want anything to drink. After taking our order she brought us cold coffee and water with ice when we specifically asked not put ice in the water. 10 more minutes and she took our order finally. Place was not packed at all, there was entire section of empty tables and 3 tables right around us were empty as well, so there was no reason to say that the waitress was swamped with tables. We had lobster bisque and fried seafood platter. Both were good, not exceptional. We did like re puff pastry on top of the lobster bisque. It was a nice touch. We probably won't come back here since there are plenty of restaurants with great service just down the street.",3 star rating,Tatyana T.

1/18/2015,"Petaluma, CA","We just endured the worst meal we have had in a long time.  I kind of understand the poor service as this place was packed, 1 hr wait times.  We ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl, lobster bisque in a bread bowl, fried shrimp plate, crab sandwich and a lobster sandwich.       The bread bowls came out fairly quickly, the bread was cold and was going stale.  Clam chowder was overwhelmingly buttery, almost like having a bowl of clam chowder flavored butter.  30 minutes later, the rest of the order came out.  The shrimp were bathed in grease and completely unseasoned, the crab sandwich looked and tasted so much like a tuna fish that I stopped eating to examine the contents closer.  In pretty sure it was crab meat, just overworked and prepared exactly like tuna fish would be.  The lobster sandwich was actually quite good, best bit of food brought to the table.  All plates came with VERY greasy unseasoned onion rings.       Overall the food quality was terrible, the service was below average,  but with a line of tourists out the door, they can get away with it.",1 star rating,Steve K.
12/9/2018,"Palmdale, CA","What a huge disappointment. While the clam chowder was very good, the two pasta dishes we had were meh to crappy. The shrimp and scallops pasta had nice sun dried tomatoes but the pasta lacked any flavor at all. Shrimp was not sautéed in butter. Scallops therefore, lacked any color or flavor, though were tender. The lobster pasta was worse. I've never had dried lobster before. The entire dish lacked absolutely any flavor period! Wonder if we just picked two bad dishes and the others were good? Not worth the price to find out.",1 star rating,Jean M.

Got the clam chowder, delish! Also got to try the hubby's lobster bisque....I wasn't a fan, and I love a good lobster bisque--needed more sherry, maybe a bit more cream. I ordered the uni, and it was amazing. Great presentation, delicious fresh taste. The husband ordered the crab sandwich...tasted like a tuna melt, we wouldn't quite recommend.Realistically this is a solid three star based on food, but location and service make it a four!",4 star rating,Anne C.
8/15/2015,"San Lorenzo, CA","Delightful! I ate here for my last meal in Santa Barbara and I couldn't have been happier with my decision. I had the fresh 3lb crab, which came out clean and gutted and it really did taste fresh. My boyfriend had the lobster roll, which was alright. Nothing spectacular, but not terrible either. The clam chowder was enjoyable, but nothing compared to SF Pier's clam chowders. The coleslaw had a nice twist with pineapple and raisins, which I really enjoyed. The onion rings were average as well. We came here at 11am, and as soon as we got our food and started feasting, it got really busy! People were lining up at the door and the inside was packed. I'm really happy with the service we had. We had a really nice waitress who was always checking up on how our food was, asking if we needed more napkins, and always made sure we had a full cup of soda. Good service makes food taste better.",4 star rating,Kaelin N.

I took another yelper's tip and ordered from the side window for to-go, which I'm glad we did because we didn't have to wait long for our order plus I didn't think what we had was worth the wait. We ordered their clam chowder and the lobster pasta. The chowder was good but the pasta was pretty bland. Felt like I was just eating pasta with olive oil. The lobster meat in the pasta was good though.",3 star rating,Kristianne O.

8/5/2014,"Fremont, CA","The hubby and I had dinner at Santa Barbara Shellfish Company last Thursday and we had a great experience. While staying in SB, I wanted to walk around Stearns Wharf - we ended up wine tasting at Deep Sea, then hopping on Yelp to look up somewhere for dinner. SBSC had great reviews, so on we went.Luckily since it was a Thursday, the wait wasn't too bad - we waited about 20 minutes for a party of 2. When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised - I was expecting your typical on-the-pier-seafood-restaurant, however, came to notice that it is a cozy seafood ""shack"" at the end of the pier. We got seated inside at a bar style table facing the window. Great views with great food.The service was decent - quick and attentive, but not necessarily friendly (but not unfriendly either!). What I loved most about the place was the atmosphere and vibe - you're just sitting in this casual and fun seafood house overlooking the water and I just had such a great time eating seafood and having a glass of wine with the hubs.During our visit, we ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Oyster Shooters, Alaskan King Crab, and Lobster Roll. Everything was absolutely delicious except for the Lobster Roll - very boring, lackluster, on the dry side, and bland. Other than that, everything was great.I would definitely come back again - looking forward to the next visit when I'm back in SB!",4 star rating,Tiffany K.
10/31/2016,"Glastonbury, CT","This place was great! I was on the pier with my parents around sunset and we decided to see if we could grab a quick, light dinner. We noticed some of the other restaurants on the pier were empty but didn't have the greatest reviews here on Yelp. Although the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company had a wait, I had a feeling it would be worth it and I was right. We added our name to the list and grabbed a seat on the bench right outside. There are pretty views here of the water and sunset. The inside of this place is super tiny so we were waiting for an outdoor table (which there also are not a lot of). We had a nice waiter and the food was great! We are New Englanders so we are a tough judge when it comes to seafood and New England Clam Chowder. The chowder was great, just like back home, and my parents really liked their fried seafood plates as well. I wish they had fried clams on the menu (they did have clam strips as a special that day, but the strips just aren't as good!).

We had the oyster shooters, abalone, cioppino, shrimp scampi, and the steamed clams and mussels in wine broth. Everything was killer our plates were left spotless. We were even drinking the wine broth from the clams and mussels from how good it was. On Valentines Day obviously it was very packed so we ended up going to the side and ordering to go to sit on the benches on the pier. We ordered oyster shooters, steamed clams and mussels and rock crab. The shooters and clams were to die for yet again. The crab got me it tasted so fresh and even came with soup(clam chowder) and a salad. I had not had fresh crab like that in quite some time. Our order was ready very quickly.

Cons:The wait to sit at the restaurant inside or on one of the limited tables outside (4). Better choice is to order the To-Go items and sit on the benches.Benches covered in bird poop so, watch out!

8/24/2014,"Monrovia, CA","My boyfriend and I came here with high expectations based on passed yelp reviews.  However, we were very disappointed in their food and service.  Their lobster roll was mediocre and their fried sampler was bland.  The calamari didn't even have any fried batter.  Now on to the service.  Every single person from the hostess to the waiter was rude.  When my boyfriend asked the hostess a question when we arrived, she gave him an attitude and said she would get back to him but never did.  When the waiter gave us our change, he slammed it on our counter and said ""Change!"" and left abruptly.  We were expecting ""thanks for dining with us!"" or something along those lines like any other restaurant.  Management needs to retrain their employees so that they can realize when they give off negative energy, it creates an unpleasant dining experience.  We came here and waited about 45 minutes to be seated and let me just say this place isn't worth the wait.",2 star rating,Marlyn R.

I had crab cakes and the gf had the 3lb rock crab special. Hers came with a soup as well as the enormous crab. Mine came with two crab cakes, a small coleslaw, and some onion rings. Even the onion rings were crazy good! Even though it was only two crab cakes, they were really dense and filling. They also came with a side of dipping aioli which was a little spicy, and a lot of awesome. Everything is fresh made right there. You can see the crabs being prepped right in front of you.

8/7/2012,"Los Angeles, CA","OMG!! This place exceeded our expectations and was a great ending to our SB trip. It's the very last building at the wharf, all the way at the end of the pier. I distinctly remember this place from a few years ago on another trip to SB, we really wanted to eat here but the wait was so long and we were so hungry we just ended up eating so-so food at Moby Dick's instead. Man, do I wish we had stuck it out and waited! This time around we were there on a Sunday afternoon, wait wasn't terrible, maybe 20 minutes or so for an outside seat. I was eyeing the Cioppino, but $19 for a cioppino bread bowl seemed a little outrageous. The waiter assured me it was a hefty portion and one of his faves so I went for it. My friends got the clam chowder bread bowl and steamed calms. We also ordered the fried shrimp, oyster, calamari & scallop to start...aaaand some bloody marys while we were at it.Our Bloody Marys came fully accessorized with lemon, lime, celery and pickled green beans! mmmmmm.  The appetizer came out quickly and I guess we didn't read the menu closely because it also came with onion rings and coleslaw! Surprise additional food FTW!! The onion rings and all the seafood were all superb, the batter was perfect and crisp - so glad we tried it. The coleslaw was really good too and I'm not even that big of a fan of coleslaw in general, but this one I attacked and went crazy.Our meals finally arrived and holy cow! My cioppino was packed with so much seafood goodness and a GIANT hunk of crab leg/claw. I was not expecting that and I was giddy with excitement. Not only did it look good, it tasted amazing!!! The best cioppino I've ever had. Yeah. I said it. There's no going back now. My friend's clam chowder was also out of this world good, better than SF clam chowder, I would even say. And the steamed clams were a winner as well.I am so deeply saddened that I can't have that having cioppino unless I make a 2 1/2 hour drive (in good traffice) up to SB.

The food, despite getting cold because of the wind was great too. I had the shrimp scampi and the clam chowder bread bowl. Nothing compares to splash in Pismo so I kind of expected it to be just as yummy. It was great but not a lot of soup for a bread bowl. I wish I would've just got a bowl with a side of bread.

7/14/2014,"San Diego, CA","I'm not really sure why this place has such a high rating or maybe I ordered the wrong items, but the items that I did order were a huge disappointment. C'mon yelp!SERVICE:-Was good.LOCATION:-Ocean view, of course!FOOD:-CLAM CHOWDER: by far one of the worst clam chowder I've had in a while. If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!! One of the clams was bad though (dead taste) but the rest were fresh.",2 star rating,Cara T.

Their food was amazing! The place is small so there is often a long wait list or crowd waiting. The servers quote about a hour wait, however the lines often speed through faster since there is a to-go window on the side. So if you have the time, I would definitely recommend this place. The place is constantly busy and their ciopinno, lobster and oysters were amazing. I would skip on the lobster taco as it was not as impressionable as the other dishes.",4 star rating,Linda L.
5/6/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Skip,   This place should be great right !? This place should probably have one of the best chowders ever right !? This spot should have crazy amounts of seafood at a reasonable price right !?  SBSC had none.  Luckily I found a nice seat outside in the sun.  I ordered a few things but the only thing that I can remember is how sub par everything was.  Just, Meh.",2 star rating,Justin F.
6/12/2012,"Orange, CA","If it weren't for the beautiful location on the wharf, this place would be a mediocre kind of place.  The prices are on par for fresh seafood, but I've had better elsewhere (specifically, Malibu Seafood...which has an equally impressive ocean view without all the tourists and waiting times).I had the crab cakes, the San Ysidro shrimp cocktail, and the Caesar salad.  I was disappointed in the shrimp cocktail, but appreciated the random avocado salad on which it was served.  The cocktail sauce was lacking.  The Caesar salad is tasty enough and even anchovy free, which I thought was strange coming from a seafood restaurant.  I liked the crab cakes the best...but can you really mess up a crab cake?Another person at our table had the cioppino, which looked AMAZING.  I wish I had gotten that.  It's a delightful spicy Italian-style seafood soup served in a sourdough bread bowl, with a rack of crab legs sprawling over it.  Oh man.Everything is really standard fare, and you're really paying for the view and the tourist attraction.  This restaurant is really just a glorified seafood stand.  The inside was stenchy, loud, and crowded, and there are only four outdoor tables (where we sat).  We only had to wait for ~ 20 minutes on a Saturday night, but we put our names in around 6:00 pm before the rush happened.  The waiter was nice, and I had a good time, but one visit was all I needed.",3 star rating,Kay D.

6/30/2018,"Brea, CA",$45 for two small lobster rolls (without drinks) that were very underwhelming and had no flavor at all is insane.

I also got some shrimp pasta i forget the name, but it was decent.  I have yet to try the rock crab but I heard good reviews.  Sucks the place is so tiny and no happy hour though. Also the clam chowder was NOT amazing. Tasted plain.Sometimes there are flies flying around everywhere, esp in teh kitchen. So it's kind of gross and unsanitary. Hence the 3 stars :/Portions are tiny, while the prices are high.  The quality of the food is definitely worth your money though.  It's really tiny and the waiters are really unattentive.  Try not to eat outside!

Since then we've had the cioppino multiple times, and most recently, he had a half lobster and 3 lbs of crab.The cioppino is fan-tas-tic, a bread bowl full of tomato-y broth/soup with crab legs and a claw, shrimps, clams, etc. So good, and worth rolling your sleeves up and getting down and dirty for.

3/29/2015,"Valencia, CA","Debated between two and three stars. The Chioppino was good, so I went three stars. I had it spicy. It was oily, but tasted good. The seafood in the stew was well cooked, the shrimp were a bit chewy but it was tolerable.  The crab cakes were doughy and the flavor wasn't great. The onion rings were greasy and bland. The coleslaw was the best thing on the plate and it was just O.K. The aioli was bland. The service was great, except he forgot the waters we requested and forgot to bring back the check with my card. The location is great if you time it so you can get a seat outside. Inside you can still see the water, but you're looking through dirty windows and past the lucky people who got the outside table. The place itself feels greasy, lots of food on the floor and on the kitchen floor too. The spoon that came with my soup had food on it, and I had to stand up to get our servers attention to bring me a clean spoon.  They seemed under staffed.",3 star rating,Amy V.
5/20/2012,"London, United Kingdom","I think I just became a huge fan of seafood. Yeah, I know... it took long enough, but Santa Barbara Shellfish Company just hooked and reeled me in!For being on the wharf (aka tourist trap), you wouldn't think that the food would be so good. Of course, I yelped it and prayed that what my yelper friends were saying about this place was true. Shoot, it better have been true since it's almost at the end of the pier! When we got there around 3PM, there was about a 20-30 minute wait. Not too bad, the place is tiny. There aren't even real tables inside, just counter space. I know there's an outdoor patio, but I didn't get a chance to see it. When we finally got seated, the bf and I decided to order the Shrimp & Scallops Linguine and the Fried Calamari, Oysters, Shrimp, and Scallops. Everything was made right in front of our faces and served to us hot and ready. Let me just say that I practically inhaled my food. The seafood was so fresh and everything seriously tasted amazing. I usually try to limit my fried food intake, but this time was an exception. I almost ordered another one because it was so good. The pasta had a generous amount of linguine, shrimps and scallops. It was the perfect lunch spot for our day at the beach. What could be better than a sunny day at the beach and eating phenomenal seafood? Nothing much, that's for sure. I'll even go as far as saying that this is the best restaurant on Stearns Wharf... it's soooo delicious!",5 star rating,Nida K.

My friend and I went here spontaneously (it was my first time, my friend invited me) but there was such a long line - it was really because of people that were done eating that weren't getting the hint to leave. We were finally seated at the bar which is the best seat since you can see them cooking.I got the fried clam strips and California king crab with New England clam chowder. My friend got her usual calamari sandwich - her favorite item. The clam strips were soooo good, perfect natural clam flavor with just enough breading. The clam chowder also gets an A+, and I'm from the east coast so I know a good chowder! And last but certainly not least...the king crab!!! It was the best seafood item I've had at a restaurant in a while. 2.5lbs of deliciousness - succulent, juicy, sweet. And taking it apart was so much fun too!It's not just the food, it's also the atmosphere of the place. It's a cute little place out on the wharf. (It gets cold so bring a jacket!)

Not that hard to do right but these people kill me they way they turn out burn't tasteless food. They haven't serviced their cooking oil in many days, trust me it shows. Coleslaw absolutely tasteless, beautiful onion rings but no, not, nana, even a speck of salt, crispy salted fries,,joke.The waitress was sharp, on point with service, attentive and very kind. She has no backing what so ever from her management, kitchen staff or floor managers,,none. She tried hard but she, unfortunately, is the only person the public gets to see and interact with, unless a customer demands to see some sort of manager.

The place seems always busy inside (barbershop style sign in sheet to get in) but it's well worth ordering from the side window and sitting out on one of the picnic tables.I'm actually not sure why anyone would want to sit inside.I had the mussels to start with and they were great. I literally drank the white wine stock they were cooked in straight from the bowl. Delicious!Then I shared half a Lobster with my wife and it was excellent.

6/12/2014,"Platte City, MO","The best crab I have ever had in my life.Bold statement. I know... but the SB Shellfish Company was not the hokey tourist-trappy ""Red Lobster"" of the pier that I first targeted it as. The wait wasn't bad at all, but we were there on a Thursday. If you must wait, doing it on a pier over the Pacific is probably the best way. We were seated overlooking the water at a counter. We started with the scallop ceviche, which was actually a 'meh' in my book. I love ceviche and I feel like the scallops were too big to have soaked up much of the flavor and it was hard to get a good scoop of everything in one bit. Still solid, but not the best. The chowder was fantastic. Loved it. Chunky and thick just like real chowder should be.. but the best hands down was our crab. It was SO good. It was warm and it was almost drippy because it was perfectly cooked. It was almost sweet too. The thing was spiky though. I cut both my thumbs trying to open it, but that was 99% because I was so busy literally racing to stuff this in my face. It was that good. I'm fairly certain all other crab is dead to me now. Just this week, Husband brought home imitation crab meat for some salads, but why bother? :) Friendly service, food came quick once we were seated and oh, did I mention that I liked the crab? I will be back here.

We came here on our first date here 3 years ago and decided to come back since we were in town. We've had a lot of freakin good food but this place still managed to come out on top. (Cajun Kitchen Cafe, Freebirds, 3 wine tastings, & 6 amazing cupcakes.) We weren't that hungry but it was cold on the pier so we put our names down, waited maybe 15 minutes and got in. We were seated by the counter area facing the kitchen which was entertaining in itself, I saw that as soon as we put in our crabcake order, the chef put hot oil in a pan and started frying em up. Cool. We also ordered a cup of clam chowder, and garlic baked clams. It sounds like the restaurant deals with a lot of impatient complaints because she felt the need to tell us that it'll take time because they actually do bake it. It's in the name. Garlic BAKED clams, of course it's going to take time. so we told her of course but it looks like she's been through a lot of shit, poor girl. Got the clam chowder first and it was amazing, my bf and I both agreed it was better than the stuff from SF pier which is saying quite a bit; the best part was that it wasn't insanely salty. We then got the crab cakes with 2 onion rings and coleslaw. Coleslaw was ok, onion rings were ok too but the crab cakes soooooooooooo gewd. We were too full though and only finished 1 and took the other home. and OMG THE BEST PART WERE THE GARLIC CLAMS which are absolutely worth the wait (which was not that long anyway, I was preoccupied with the chowder, and crabcakes probably waited 17 mins tops) It was 6 large clams that were meaty and juicy, covered with breadcrums, pieces of garlic, and cheese and it was delicious. Service was also good, relatively speedy and we were out of there in less than an hour I think. Good stuff.",5 star rating,Amy K.

Went to the bathroom first, a male cook came out and had peed all over the seat. As I walked through the restaurant, I took a look at the prep area which was filthy. Filthy buckets for entrails, shells, etc.. pipes, walls, all of it was filthy. The large tank that was visible from outside, held the crabs and it was disgusting. They must have been at least 5 or 6 deep with only a few of the top ones barely moving.We got out of there immediately and had dinner at Moby Dick next door.

I LOVE the clam fettuccini and their clam chowder is delicious! The head cook is quite a chef and watching him prepare the food is very entertaining. He does bang the pots LOUDLY - so be aware of your ears are sensitive. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it and is cheaper than many in town.

The first guy who sat us came around and let him he know he sat us, John didn't seem too happy and was very unprofessional with his co-worker. John left and came back and asked us where our name was on the clipboard, we showed him, he went on to explain that there was another party before us that was waiting to be seated.... how is that our fault? He didn't ask- he told us we need to leave our table and wait for the next one to come up, again unprofessional and rude. Left the place, called and spoke to manager Pete who gave a generic response.

4/18/2014,"San Jose, CA","Trying out some local seafood. Clam chowder, fresh abalone and a 7 LBS spider crab. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I was very surprise, the clam chowder here was better then Sam's Chowder House. I would drive here just for the clam chowder. The fresh abalone sauté with tomatoes and sweet basil was very tender. For a first timer eating fresh abalone, it was surprisingly good and not chewy. This is my first time eating a fresh spider crab. It was very sweet and meaty. It's like eating a poor man's Alaskan King crab, but for $9.99 LBS, you can't go wrong : )",5 star rating,Bobby L.
4/3/2014,"Pasadena, CA","Eli-score-o-meter: 3+1/3Being in Santa Barbara always makes me crave seafood. Either than or chorizo soaked in cheese. Given that seafood is abundant in the wharf areas, and that my company and I had worked up an appetite running around the beach, I opted to bring is here. First, the company I was with could brighten any day, so mood did not really affect this perspective. Second, wine was poured so that also improved the spirits. However, there were some not-to-be overlooked flaws and shortcomings to this place. The menu is a bit confusing. Should I look at the menu or the chalkboard ahead of me, or the random appetizers haphazardly scattered around the place on small chalkboards? This made it very hard for us to make orders that were of sound judgement. But we persevered. Oysters (blue & local). Flavorful, fresh, very poorly shucked. Not a single one I had was cleaned properly of grit. Additionally, many large chunks of shell were common in each one. Really not pleasant, but they were so rushed, who cares?Rock crab (their specialty) was tasty, though probably less than ~3lbs quoted. Yet it was hard to compare against the size of the enormous spider crabs being hacked to bits through the window. There's very little that can be incorrect about the preparation of this item. Served with butter an cocktail sauce and a number of wipes. Abalone. Served fried over tomato rice pilaf of a sort. It was reminiscent of a risotto, but that's neither here nor there. The abalone was tender enough, lightly breaded, and tasty. It was probably the best item, but something we ordered after we noticed it in some tiny corner of the blackboard. It was difficult to get the waiter back to make the order. Overall, the meal was fine. However, the constant negative chatter from the unseated guests piling up behind us and shoved into the entranceway was unappealing. They were hungry and irritated by the lack of service. Commenting about what we were eating and how long it was taking. But the restaurant did nothing to deal with the massive crowd. I'll stick to Brophy's or any one of the hundred other seafood establishments that offer a much better experience.",3 star rating,Eli S.

3/6/2015,"Long Beach, CA","1.5 stars. The only good thing about dining here is we got a 90min free parking with validation and their clam chowder. Unfortunately, that's it. With all the good reviews, my expectations were high. It was a hot day and it was lunch time, we didn't mind the long wait under the sun. But the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive. There were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list. Not good for the business, definitely not good for waiting customers.Crab cakes - If i didn't know what they were, I won't be able to guess that they were crab cakes. Just a fishy patty of some sort.Fried calamari/scallop/shirmps - They were cooked just right. Could have been perfect if they were not salty.Rock crab special, served with soup and salad - Soup and salad were served first, expecting they were cooking the crab. After 20 mins, we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away... It was big! At least the top shell.. Underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size. The top shell was even clean, meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already. Also, we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served COLD.. Not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge. Thinking we may have placed the order wrong, we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold. She acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated. She came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab, im not surprised that its still not warm. What a waste of money. Silverwares have heavy water stains, looks very unsanitary. Forks were crooked. We asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers. Good for them, bad for us. We will never come back.",2 star rating,Meng M.

You tasted the ice and tobassco more than anything. The clam chowder was great that was only saving grace. The lobster roll was nit what we expected becuae it was mostly filler than lobster not the big chunks of lobster and buttered roll you'd expect especially for $18. My meal was consisted of fried oysters, shrimp, calamari and scallops but it was super scarce and not bountiful as before where I had leftovers.

I also enjoyed the open kitchen where you could see the sea food and the preparation of everyones meal. The whole staff made quite a show of it.

Tasted like rubber on bitter cabbage with a squeeze of lemon...and the worst of it was that it was $18.95.

12/29/2013,"Washington, DC","This is the first place we opted to eat seafood in Santa Barbara, and it was not too shabby. We walked to the restaurant from our hotel, which was a bonus. Taking in the atmosphere of the wharf on a chilly night certainly got us into the Santa Barbara mood. Even once we arrived, the small bar style dining and aroma of the day's catch inside the place was in line with the image one conjures up when thinking of fresh seafood.After a very brief wait, we got a seat looking directly at the kitchen, and let me tell you, the staff have this operation down to a science. They are moving people in and out of the restaurant at record speed, all without sacrificing service. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, and we never once felt rushed. In fact, this was a highlight for us. Even when selecting our beverages, he let us sample beer and made recommendations on wine. We ordered all of our food at once, as we'd had a chance to peruse the menu and take a few tips from Yelp. We ordered a glutenfest including a cup of clam chowder, a half dozen oysters, some coconut shrimp and the shrimp and scallop linguine.The clam chowder arrived first, and it was a bit bland. I really wanted to like it since the weather was ideal and they add bacon in every batch (!), but it was lacking something. Adding the oyster crackers helped, but I would recommend skipping this. If you are in a soup mood, maybe try the soup of the day. They had a bisque, and that might have been a better option. The oysters arrived next, and that was the biggest letdown for me. I am an oyster junkie - I've been known to eat four dozen in one sitting. I'm also an oyster purist, meaning I add only a tiny bit of lemon before eating them so they maintain their sea flavor. The presentation was sloppy - just ice on a plate, which was melting and wet our eating area, a measly slice of lemon and lime, cocktail sauce and a little horseradish. The oysters themselves just weren't that good, and for the first time in my life, I left two on the plate when it went back.The coconut shrimp and linguine arrived together, and they were both quite good. You know how sometimes when you get coconut shrimp, they seem to be lacking coconut? These babies were loaded with it and were large in size to boot. I think I bit into the tail on every shrimp I ate on account of the batter being so delicious. The onion ring garnish was also amazing. Maybe it's just the fact that I don't eat gluten often, but the batter on everything was outstanding.The linguine was pretty good as the seafood was tender and the noodles were just past al dente. The sauce was a little too white winey for me, but my boyfriend loved it. Maybe it felt like too much because I was already drinking a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.All in all, I think this was a three and a half star dining experience. Admittedly, the biggest disappointment was likely my own elevated expectations. Yelp reviews caused me to believe that the food would be spectacular, and I'd say it was just good. Seeing the aquariums of crab was also sad as they were overcrowded and all trying to escape. Maybe I've just seen Finding Nemo too many times, but I couldn't watch them. Watching the chef, however, was fun, and the shellfish coming off the grill looked delicious. It's possible that we just didn't order the right thing, so we will likely go back once more during our stay to try their specials and the lobster tacos.",3 star rating,Sally K.

1/6/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Great seafood, very good prices, and excellent service!  For a restaurant located directly on the pier (with plenty of tourists), Santa Barbara Shellfish Company (SBSC) is very competitively priced and offers a wide, but straightforward menu of various seafood dishes.  With the exception of a few ""market-priced"" seafood (Spiny Lobster $44.99/lb), everything was within the $12-20 range.  Seating is indoor/outdoor, but overall, not much seating as it's all booth seating indoors and a few tables outdoor.  Outdoor seating would be awesome on a nice, sunny, non-breezy day since there's a great view of the pier.  However, it was cold and a bit windy on my visit, so we hid indoors amongst all the other tourists.  Surprisingly, the bathroom is HUGE and about 1/3rd of the restaurant lolThe items that I tried: New england clam chowder: thick, creamy, and full of clam meat. recommendedLobster Bisque: a bit more watery & tomatoey than usual, good flavor but didn't taste much lobster.  For my palate it was fine, but maybe not for everyoneFried Clam strips: very breaded and very crispy.  seasoned and tasted good (like everything fried).  Wouldn't recommend this unless you also ordered another seafood dish.  Really like a very large appetzier and not a real entree (but served as one)Rock Crab: delicious, flakly, and sweet!  Monstrous claws with ample amount of meat.  I ordered the ""3lb Rock Crab special"" that came with soup and a salad for $24.99.  Great value on such a large, freshly caught crab***if you're going on a weekend or a holiday, expect at least a 30 minute wait!!

As a restaurant on the water, they do not suffer from the beach-food curse of ""great views, poor foods."" Exactly the opposite: Solid fresh seafood period. Great atmosphere giving that genuine feeling of a bustling seafood shack on a pier. Small capacity & the wait can be long at peak hours. Limited seating outside but can be romantic at night when the weather's right. Prompt friendly service, love their work ethic & knowledge - very patient with foreigners & tourists who oooh and ahhh over the tanks of live crab. They're very accommodating & put up with a lot (take photo, take photo, hold crwab, hold crwab)... Oyster on the half shell - a little pricey, but fresh and well-shucked & presented. Seasonal selection.Oyster Shooters - delicious but I hold the cheese. Personal Preference.Garlic Baked Clams - Crowdpleaser. Comfort app.Abalone is tender and flavorful served over a bed of Spanish rice that will make you scrape your plate. I did. And now I wonder how many tourists scraped that plate before me... Shrimp Tacos were solid - nice salsa and tender. Get it with the Spanish rice.I've seen the lobster pasta and even though I'm slightly anti-lobster anything other than plain outa the shells or lobster rolls... it looked tempting and bountiful.The ultimate winners? The Crab & Cioppino.Get the local crab (I like with the Crab innards/mustard) or for a treat, the ALASKAN legs - I die.Cioppino - I got it spicy. Get it spicy. It's not your traditional italian nona's cioppino, but it was delishious. I love they put a half of crab for you to get in there with and the bread bowl was served heated and toastey. So good that I brought my leftover breadbowl, soaked in all the yummy broth home for a later snack hehe... my friends thought I was crazy. They missed out.Tip - Don't come here for the soups - not really anything special.Only beer/wine. It does attract toursists but the locals definitely go here as well.",4 star rating,Mari L.
9/3/2014,"San Francisco, CA","I felt like this place was just ok. Expensive, of course because it's located on the pier but nothing we ordered was a wow. I don't consider myself a picky eater but the crab cake wasn't good at all. Even the Bloody Mary was disappointing! The place is tiny too so I imagine the wait would normally be insane here on a weekend. Perhaps next time I should order the special... Except that it's $18.95! Yikes.",2 star rating,Erin C.

French fries, cole slaw were really good and the onion rings were as good as the best I have ever had. We especially enjoyed the clam strips, the assorted battered and fried oysters, shrimp, scallops and the halibut. unfortunately we were not in town long enough to sample other fare. Highly recommended.",4 star rating,H Paul C.

Orders take about 10-15 minutes depending on how busy they are.Everything we had was excellent:Cioppino $18.95Crab legs, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels in our homemade Cioppino sauce.

You can however order takeout and eat on the benches on the wharf. Loved the bisque, the lobster tacos and the Stone Crab Claws. They don't come broken or semi shelled, so be prepared to exercise your hands. Overall a very enjoyable experience and will be back when in this part of the country.",4 star rating,Bobby G.

The crab was as fresh as can get, we watched them pluck him out of the tank and kill it though it wasn't as tasty as some of the smaller crab. Lobster bisque was great too. One crab and soup meal can easily fill up two people. They also have a decent assortment of drafts.",4 star rating,Ronaldo H.

7/28/2014,"Bakersfield, CA","We were in Santa Barbara for the day and decided to try this place for lunch.  First of all, parking on the pier is a joke.  You take a ticket when you enter the pier and the first 90 minutes is free with any business validation.  Problem is there was ABSOLUTELY NO PARKING SPACES.  So after driving around like a vulture for 20 minutes I decided to drive off the pier and park in the nearby neighborhood.  At least they didn't charge me when I told them I couldn't find a space.Finally got parked and made it to the restaurant.  They said the wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being about 45 minutes.  No big deal cause we weren't in a hurry or anything.  I ordered the abalone with rice special.  She had the 3 pound rock crab special.  It was my first time eating abalone so I was excited to try it.  Everything was just okay.  Service was mediocre.  Price was about what I expected.  This place was not bad but I think they are definitely 3 stars and not 4 stars.  I don't think I'm coming back.",3 star rating,Bryan D.

The only thing is that there is no sun shade, so bring a hat, sunscreen and sunglasses. As for the food: 1) clam strips special with onion rings and cole slaw - the clams were good and so was the tartar sauce, the cole slaw and onion rings had no flavor. 2) clam chowder bread bowl- the biggest joke of a soup bowl ever! It was so small that we ordered another cup of chowder to eat with the bread.

6/22/2012,"Durham, NC","You earn 4 stars for your awesome outdoor seating, right at the edge of the pier with a view of the ocean. Just plain  awesome. But I wish your food had been a little better for the price. This place looks like a divey seafood spot at first, but then  when you start looking at the menu, especially for being literally on the ocean with instant access to seafood, I was shocked to see how pricey some  of their food items were. We ended up getting some beers and my mom and I split lobster tacos and crab cakes. Both dishes were good (a little on the small side portion wise), and they both tasted fresh which we liked, but have we had better lobster? yup. better crab cakes? yup. So all in all, this place is a nice spot to grab appetizers and some beer I say, but for a whole meal, your money will be better spent and will go a lot further elsewhere. Or better yet, just get apps here and then go get dessert somewhere on the pier!!!",3 star rating,Sarah G.

The location is cool on the end of stearns wharf, it would be gorgeous during sunset. The only negative was it's very small so took over an hour to be seated but you can watch them cook the crab right in front of you which was interesting. They cooked up a 13 pound crab while we were waiting which was crazy to see. It's also out on the water so the view is nice while you wait. We got clam chowder and the rock crab special which were both great! We also got a shrimp and scallop pasta which was good but not amazing. The workers were very nice. We would recommend and go back to this place for sure!",4 star rating,Alyssa F.
10/23/2011,"Forest Hills, NY","Near the end of Stearn's Wharf is this small, unassuming shack of a place that turned out to be a great choice for seafood.  While waiting for the Shellfish Company to open, the big attraction were the large tanks lining its windows, filled with shellfish.  It was smaller than expected, even seeing it from the outside; aside from a row of outdoor tables alongside it, the interior just has bar seating around the kitchen, and bar seating along the wall, looking out the windows.  I snagged a corner spot at the kitchen bar counter so I could view the action, and took a Figueroa Hoppy Poppy IPA to start while I perused the menu, including the large chalkboard with specials.I started with a refreshing, generously portioned, crab cocktail, surprisingly well-presented in a wide-mouthed glass.  Super fresh, perfect with its wedge of creamy avocado and spritzes of lime and lemon.  Then came the incredible lobster tacos special, which outdid every other taco I had on this California trip.  Sweet, juicy, just-cooked chunks of lobster steaming on a bed of stewed tomatoes, herbs, and shredded cabbage/lettuce.  The tortillas could definitely have been better, but this time, the filling was good enough to elevate the whole.  Having reached seafood nirvana, I could have stopped but gluttony prevailed (and not wanting to waste opportunities when the going's good) and I took a half order of their special beer-boiled shell-on Ridgeback prawns.  These beauties were huge, fresh, with very hard shells.  It was finger fun to peel them, eat them, and suck on the innards of the heads.I was very satisfied with the quality of the seafood.  Service was quick and friendly.  Casual seating but it fits the place and I found it comfortable.  With limited seating, it fills up fast.  Highly recommend taking a spot at the kitchen bar counter and enjoy the seafood.",4 star rating,Valery C.
11/5/2015,"San Diego, CA","While visiting Santa Barbara I used Yelp to lead me here for what I thought would be a good meal of seafood on the pier. Instead I debated jumping off the pier in disgust. I'll start with the scallop ceviche. It comes to our table and I take a bite to determine if I should spice it up with some Cholula or if it needs salt. I then put a little salt on it, take another bite and the scallop ceviche has suddenly disappeared while I never had the opportunity to taste a scallop. I never even tasted a scallop. So essentially I paid $15 for a Roma tomato and bed of cabbage. I'd like to speak to the Chef. Chef, you're fired, take a swim!! Moving right along to my shrimp tacos..... Their smallest 3 shrimp inside a tortilla, The End. The first time I have been really disappointed in Yelp. This place was horrible!!",1 star rating,Nic J.

In fact we saw fishermen come in to drop off a new catch of crabs. Clam chowder is a must have. Easily one of the best. Rock crab special was good though a bit salty for my taste. Get ready to get dirty because you'll need to get cracking. Onion rings that came as a side were a great addition. My dad got the crab sandwich. I had some and it was really good, with bits of crab. Mom and sister both got different pastas.

1/30/2012,"Chicago, IL","THE GOOD- The lobster was pre-cracked perfectly. I've actually not seen a grilled lobster served as well as this one. The claw broke apart easily, and the meat came out just as easily.- The lobster was also cooked perfectly. The lobster was really the only thing going for this place.- The clam chowder had great flavor, but wasn't quite chunky enough for my taste.THE BAD- The prices were a bit ridiculous, especially considering these meals were served on paper plates and taken to a bench outside, no additional service provided.THE UGLY- The lobster bisque was lukewarm and watery.- The onion rings were greasy and cold.BOTTOM LINE: Maybe I'm just spoiled from FL seafood, but I probably won't eat here again. Thankfully I was lucky enough to have ordered the lobster and enjoyed it. At least the seagulls ate very well here.",2 star rating,Aimee B.

Not only was the so called restaurant located at the end of the pier, where the sound of fog horns and obnoxious tourists, there was a huge waiting list to get a table. At this point one would think if there's a waiting list it must be good, do not be fooled. After deciding to get takeout and sit outside, the crab sandwich was soggy and flavourless, all of the food was cold and the classic duo of fish and chips is non existent. However, the three flavourless breaded onion rings were much to my disappointment. The lobster tacos also flavourless. Overall this meal was not worth 75$$!

5/24/2018,"Canoga Park, CA","This was my third time here with my boyfriend. First time, we were both pleasantly surprised. The uni and scallops were amazing and the Dungeness Crab spectacular. The second time, they were out of uni but the two dozen fresh oysters made up for it! We had clam chowder, a lobster roll, and Dungeness Crab again. It was the best meal my boyfriend and I have ever had! The crab was flakey and fresh and probably the best crab we'd both ever had (we eat crab a lot.) THIS TIME HOWEVER, we came for our anniversary and got oysters, uni, and Dungeness crab. The scallops under the uni were warm and questionable but still good enough to eat. The oysters were fresh and good. When we got our 3 lb crab it was smaller than expected. We got an old rotten crab that had a bad aftertaste. It was 2 lbs at most. We didn't complain and just asked for our check, when our waitress was picking up our plates she dropped melted butter and crab juice all over my boyfriends jeans. She looked down at it and just said ""I'll get you some water for that."" WHAT?! An apology would've sufficed, which we did get when we were about to leave. It just seemed insincere and like she wasn't taking responsibility for her mistake. I work in a restaurant so I understand how it is, but I always apologize to paying customers when I'm at fault.

I came here for the second time last weekend and as far as seafood goes, it will never let me down.The only reason I took off a star was because I listed my family's name down and they skipped over it. We came for lunch on a Saturday at 2:00pm and I had listed my name, then crossed the first one out since it was a bit messy, then wrote it again right next to it. After about 25 minutes of waiting, they call our names, say the table will be ready soon, and never call us again. We figure out that our name has already been crossed off. UGH! So, we had to list our name again and waited another 15 minutes. In total, we waited approximately 40 minutes -____-Anyways, we had their oyster shooters, rock crab, lobster, lobster tacos, and calamari sandwich - all of which were very good. Very fresh! Very tasty! The lobster and crab also came with soup and salad beforehand. The clam chowder is amazing. It's so good. I don't know how they do it. Maybe it's something with the clams and fresh seafood. Overall, I love this place. I understand it was a misunderstanding that our names were crossed off the list, but still, if I didn't love this place, I wouldn't have waited that extra 15 minutes.",4 star rating,Kristel R.

When they say ""shellfish"", they mean it - no fish here (they have another restaurant for that elsewhere in the city), but you certainly tell the product was fresh. Of course, I think that the location and market pricing increased prices above what you might be able to find at other restaurants - a beer, garlic mussels, and an oyster shooter was just about $20.",4 star rating,Brad S.
