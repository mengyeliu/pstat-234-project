7/26/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Whether you're vegan or not, you must visit Mesa Verde. They are currently open for dine-in, with plenty of outdoor seating. The atmosphere is super cute, cozy, and green! I love the amount of greenery/plants around the restaurant. Parking is pretty easy here as they have their own lot in front. When the food first came out, I was immediately drawn to the presentation of the two plates because they were absolutely stunning. I see why Mesa Verde was featured in the Michelin Guide. The food tastes just as good as it looks. The impossible burrito is a must. It's HUGE and delicious! It's one of the prettiest burritos I've ever seen and it was loaded with flavor. My partner said it was the meatiest burrito he's ever had, even meatier than all the burritos he had as a meat eater. The waiter also recommended the green plant bowl and I'm so glad he did because it was packed with so many different ingredients. I loved the combination of different flavors and textures. The two of us miraculously finished everything on our plates, but we were SO FULL. I'll definitely need to come back and remind myself to save room for dessert.",5 star rating,Ashley H.

12/4/2020,"Orange County, CA","I'm one of those not-a-vegan-but-will-eat-vegan-food kind of people. I absolutely loved their mushroom burger on homemade bread - it's more of a flatbread than a bun, which I prefer! Their za'atar fries were excellently spiced. They have a small patio to work with during COVID so I assume they get pretty packed sometimes. Best spot for food I've been to in Santa Barbara thus far.",5 star rating,Julie L.
5/11/2021,"San Diego, CA","Eat here. Fantastic food. I had a curry dish topped with mushrooms that was very flavorful and filling. My wife had the green bowl, she ate most of and I got to finish.  Both were delicious for very different reasons. The curry was substantial with hunks of squash resting on a bed of couscous. While the flavors were familiar from dishes I've had, It was like a mix between a stew and a chili with simple glorious vegetables.The green bowl had two highlights the first being the  bed of lentils and fried rice that was unique. The sweet potato is a favorite and was highlight two, just tasty. The two sauces were well balanced and flavorful.",5 star rating,Steven A.
4/6/2021,"Brooklyn, NY","I appreciate what Mesa Verde is trying to do with Vegan cuisine. I have been here many times over the last year and would have given it a 5 star rating each time. The Brussels sprouts, tacos, grilled cheese, and squash quesadilla were always delicious.That said, I have come here two times recently and have been shocked with how much the food quality has declined. The last time I was there I asked our waiter if the items had changed -- the lack of flavor was so apparent-- and he retorted the chefs were the same so there's no way there would be any difference.I will not be coming back soon as there are much better vegan restaurants in Santa Barbara. I hope that Mesa Verde returns to their previous level of quality.",3 star rating,Nadia B.
2/28/2021,"Los Angeles, CA","Was very excited to find vegan food in Santa Barbara but this place let me down.1. There's no hostess so we stood around for about 10 minutes before we finally asked someone what to do. Waited another 15 for a table.2. Pretty poor service. I ordered a salad leaving out olives and onions. The salad had some of both anyway (Not an allergy problem but once I bit into them I was so revolted I couldn't finish my meal). 3. The salad was supposed to contain blackberries and beets. I counted three blackberries and two tiny baby beets. So it was basically lettuce for $16. 3. I had eaten the croutons, a few bites of lettuce, and one blackberry before having to stop. She took the salad away but then charged me for it! I politely expressed my surprise and she said ""well that's the policy, you ordered it."" Major customer service fail! In the end I did not pay but it was quite uncomfortable.Luckily, there's a grocery store across the street so I still got dinner!Food is interesting but portions quite small and overpriced.",2 star rating,B P.
5/3/2021,"Thousand Oaks, CA","Loved this place! My husband tried the street tacos and really liked them. He isn't quite convinced of the vegan cuisine yet and I think this meal got him much closer to considering more vegan dishes.My Mediterranean bowl was awesome. Best falafel I've had, hands down! So happy with our meals!",5 star rating,Stephanie C.
5/16/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","I took my family to what we thought would be a great place to eat. No host, no one to really ask questions. So we sat at a table for 25 minutes while no servers looked our way even though tables next to us were being waited on. I finally asked the cashier if we had to order out front. The poor girl was so flustered by her pissed off waitress co worker that she came over to take our order. She said I'm not even supposed to be taking orders. We waited another 25 minutes and nothing came at all. I walked over to ask the manager what was going on and the ticket for food had not even started to be made and no drinks brought out. I'm afraid that because of the pandemic the restaurant can't keep a full staff. I felt horrible for the cashier because she was in tears and she was trying to do her best. Ultimately we walked out without eating or drinking anything. I will never go back.",1 star rating,Matt R.
5/14/2021,"San Francisco, CA","First thing first! THE SMOOTHIE IS 10/10. Get the "" CALYPSO "" MY ASS IS LACTOSE INTOLERANT. I guap that shit down and it's homemade almond milk so no diary. It was soooo goooood. It's Bananas, Strawberries, Blueberries with Blue Agave. We are from the Bay Area. We found this place on the way back home. I'm not even vegetarian but then the food was really good! The Raja Tacos was really good and the Pizza, also the Impossible burrito was good too. Staff was super friendly, I would come back here if I lived closer.",5 star rating,Julia D.
12/9/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I was dining here when one of my dearest friends was a grad student, over a year ago. We changed tables for better lighting because the poor thing needed to do readings for class. Our servers were super friendly and accommodating, letting us change tables so easily.We found our food to be super yummy! We ordered the Green Bowl and the Rajas Tacos. I'm pretty greedy so I am inclined to want to try everything. My friend Jules is just about as adventurous as I am, so we are good team when it comes to trying out new food. We got food to share, back when it was socially acceptable. Our food came out rather quickly, probably because it was not too busy when we were dining.One thing to note for me was that the baklava was not the best baklava I've had. I'm still trying to figure out if I like baklava, but I was not yet convinced. It was super sweet, not unlike our wonderful servers.",5 star rating,Nathan N.
5/9/2021,"Burbank, CA","I placed an order online at 4:43 for a 5:30 pickup. I also called and confirmed the order. I arrived at 5:30 and they could not find the order. (As always, I tipped when I first placed our order,18%, then more would be added to a good order.)  They said it would be 10 minutes, but it was 5:55 before I received the order. At no time did anyone apologize.  We love to support vegan restaurants and we have enjoyed eating here in the past, in fact, I recommended it just today. We live out of the area and haven't been here since July 2020, I wonder if management changed. The socca pizza was delicious (thus 2 stars rather than 1 star) but the autumn salad was missing the listed blackberries.  Disappointing experience.",2 star rating,Sharon S.
4/10/2021,"Sausalito, CA","We came to Mesa to meet up with family to reconnect after a year of isolation once the older members have been vaccinated. We sat outside, it is shaded with sufficient spacing between tables. Service is extremely attentive and friendly! As we were waiting we had the grilled flatbread with hummus which is delicious! We also had the pizza, the street tacos, the Mediterranean Bowl, the Caesar salad & green bowl. All the food was fresh and delicious, and we were all happy with our dishes. Highly recommend, not only for vegans but everyone who appreciates healthy and yummy food!",5 star rating,Yael B.
3/22/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","Mesa Verde is consistently good but it's not going to blow you away. It's not my favorite place in town, but if you want some healthy options it's a good go-to. Personally, however, I think it's way overpriced for what you get. You can spend less and get more food at The Natural Cafe, which has similar options. I have tried both of their tacos--the street tacos and the rajas tacos. Both are average. The street tacos are very filling, and I recommend them if you like jackfruit! The rajas tacos are a bit of a let down. I can easily make the same tacos at home for a fourth of the price. They really just had grilled veggies, avo, and some vegan cheese. The tortillas are quite good and hold up to the toppings. I've also tried their curry, risotto, and Brussels sprouts. Each of the options looked so much better in the pictures but the flavors just did not go well together. I have left hungry each time, which is a bit of a disappointment after spending a lot of money (it's not cheap!). The Brussels sprout appetizer is about $15...seems to be way overpriced.",3 star rating,Mattie W.
7/8/2020,"Manhattan Beach, CA","Quick recap:-          Food: Good-          Portion size: Average-          Service: Table service; Nice Staff-          Environment: Casual-          $: Sort of overpriced -          Perks: Outside patioMore details:Went there for lunch. We had a California salad ($16) and the Street Tacos ($14). It was good, but nothing to write home about.In my opinion, the food looks way better than it actually tastes. Was a bit disappointed to basically pay $18 (tips included) for a salad and walk out still very hungry. The staff is nice and helpful though.Overall?Loved the presentation. Taste was very average",4 star rating,Claryssr B.
12/31/2020,"West Hollywood, CA","Coming back from a road trip, we decided to drive by Santa Barbara on the way back to LA. I'm always on the hunt for some good vegan grub so when I saw this place had a Michelin star, I was like count me in!It was super cute inside but of course, due to COVID it was ""to go"" only. I opted for the ""grilled cheese"" which certainly not a grilled cheese. I would call it more of a ""creamy cheese sandwich."" It was super creamy and tart due to the pickles and mustard. A pleasant surprise was the spicy pepper but it wasn't that overwhelming. The sandwich came with potato chips which were alright. The whole meal was very greasy and messy. The sandwich was pretty flavorful but the bread kinda hurt my mouth. My boyfriend got the mushroom umami burger. We didn't get a pic but he liked it. It was covered in beets (and I hate beets) so I didn't try it. He said it was good but ""pretty earthy.""They have a pretty great menu so we will come back when we stay in Santa Barbara. We might not have hit a home run but I'm sure we will the next time.",3 star rating,Katie H.
12/5/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","I've reviewed Mesa Verde before with 5 stars and I've always ordered the street tacos, which are really very good.We (party of 4) had the polenta fries, which is our typical starter, and they were typically great. So crunchy and yummy.I was going to order the mushroom umami burger, but asked the waiter (who was great) for recommendations and ordered the couscous instead. I've got to say, it was just okay. There was some sort of chili/cumin spice and there was so much of it, that it overpowered the whole dish. It was impossible to distinguish any other flavor in the dish, because every bite tasted exactly the same, like chili/cumin overdose.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate hazelnut dessert, which was super dry. I didn't finish either dish and took the couscous home. The next day, I threw it out. Hubby ordered the Mediterrenean bowl, which he liked. One guest had the special pizza, which she mostly didn't eat and didn't really like.I do have to say that the atmosphere was lovely, which is pushing my 3 stars to 4. They have big barrels on wheels that are portable fireplaces. They produced alot of heat and wonderfully romantic light. We were very happy with the atmosphere and the wine/beer list. But, the food wasn't as good as it has been in the past.",4 star rating,Harriet E.
2/2/2021,"Ventura, CA","I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while, unfortunately I have turned away a handful of times because I was not able to find parking in that teeny tiny small lot. On this particular day I put it out to the universe that I was going to get a parking spot, and as I pulled in there was one right in front. Thank you, universe. :) They had just re-opened for dining on the patio, but I opted for takeout. I let them know it was my first time and they helped me with a couple of suggestions. I decided on the jackfruit tacos and the baklava for dessert. It took a little while to get my food, but it was understandable, because like I said it was their first day of having patio dining open again and the place was busy. All of the staff were so nice though. When my food arrived it was most certainly worth the wait. High-quality, great presentation, unique flavors. My goodness!! This is terrific vegan Mexican food. In the future I will deal with the crappy minimal parking and make my way back in. Looking forward to trying more of their items soon.",4 star rating,Sanaz S.
5/4/2021,"Los Angeles, CA",It's been too long!  I still love this place and chose it to be my first dining experience since March 2020 (when of course I stopped dining out). It just doesn't disappoint. Great food and service as usual!!,5 star rating,Jon N.
5/25/2021,"Fountain Valley, CA",Great Vegan cuisine with some creative and delicious choices! Service needs to be refined but I'm easy to please.,4 star rating,Jana M.
5/21/2021,"San Francisco, CA","This is a review for takeout only. Was really excited to try this place, and the food was tasty but not amazing. Beautiful presentation, but emphasis seemed to be on plating and the sauces. We got the green plant bowl and the impossible burrito. The impossible burrito was enormous, flavorful, but lacked texture given so much sauce. The green plant bowl was good, but heavy on the rice and sauces without many veggies. The potatoes had also sprouted. All in all, would rather spend half the $$ at Natural Cafe.",3 star rating,Katie R.
10/23/2020,"Whittier, CA",Stopped by this place on the way to our hotel in Goleta. Looked up healthy food in the location and this caught our eye. We love brussel sprouts so had to try them when we saw them on the menu. They were delicious and were a plentiful amount! My Mediterranean bowl was delicious especially the hummus and the pita bread. I love that the falafel was super crispy but it was a tad bit dry. Lunch was filling and delicious!,4 star rating,Erika R.
4/6/2021,"Los Angeles, CA",Mesaverde goes far beyond being a Vegan Restaurant. Their dishes are creative with farm fresh ingredients and  bright flavors.We started with the flatbread with hummus and brussels sprouts which were delicious and beautifully presented.After the starters we wanted to try everything so asked our very friendly and attentive server Rozy  for her recommendations. She suggested we try the impossible burrito and the empanada. Also ordered the Tunisian Curry and two salads. We were delighted with Rozy suggestions.  Each dish was bursting with flavor. The greens tasted like they were harvested that day. As with the starters the presentation of the main dishes was appetizing.For dessert we had the very tasty brown marble.You can't go wrong  with  this  reasonably priced  gourmet restaurant with  great service. Would highly recommend Mesaverde.,5 star rating,Jacolyn H.

12/28/2020,"Cleveland, OH",My husband and I decided to order takeout during a weekend in SB! Of course it was during COVID times so we couldn't enjoy seating in the restaurant but we picked up our order after calling it in and drove to a nearby park and parked and ate dinner. We order the impossible meat burrito and the tacos. The burrito is HUGE! We weren't able to finish the burrito in one sitting and had to take it back to our hotel. It was delicious and spicy! The tacos were also delicious and a really good option as well! The ordering was easy as we called the restaurant ahead and picked up. Everyone was kind on the phone whilst ordering and during pickup!,5 star rating,Harpreet K.
4/28/2021,"Earth, TX","Love this place ! Love the Ponzu Burger, the Jackfruit tacos and the Mediterranean bowl. We love a good vegetarian restaurant, as they are hard to come by.  Love having them right in our neighborhood.",5 star rating,Niro K.
3/20/2021,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",Oh my gosh this place is spectacular - we tried 6 different items from the menu - each was delicious and provided us with very exquisite flavors. No wonder the chef has a Michelin star. If you are in SB - you have to check it out!!!,5 star rating,Nirav S.
7/7/2020,"New York, NY","Amazing restaurant we stopped at for lunch while passing through Santa Barbara! The street tacos we're very filling even though the pictures look like mini tacos. The blueberry salsa, jackfruit chorizo, and cashew cheese werea unique and delicious combo. The famous impossible burrito was worth the price as it definitely could be shared. The enchilada sauce gave the whole burrito a spicy kick, and there were more then plenty avocados inside. The polenta fries were very crispy and filling, and were almost like a unique twist on chili fries. I'll definitely be stopping here again the next time I'm in Santa Barbara. And hopefully I'll have time to try the baklava dessert.Worth noting that the servers were all very nice and accommodating during these covid times with setting up the table with enough space to social distance from other guests, wearing masks the entire time, and sanitizing everything.",5 star rating,Kristin S.
1/28/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","I live in LA but, purposely find myself driving up the coast to visit Mesa Verde. Ambiance is practical but, quaint. But, omg the staff here are just SO nice!!! I found myself chatting with the waiters who genuinely cared about us having the best experience possible!!! Seriously great people here. Unique take on dishes with deliciously fresh ingredients!! I've tried the tacos and gosh are they yum! The tortilla itself holds so much flavor and even more so, the ingredients within. So now for the TWO drawbacks of this restaurant. Parking sucks. There's about 10 spaces... I've never ever encountered an empty space when I've visited. I've always found myself parking in the plaza across the street. Not too sure how safe this is... so far, I haven't gotten towed. Next, and more I'm importantly, what happened to the cheese plate???! My initial reason for returning was that magnificent cheese platter that I was graced with. I have now discovered (much to my dismay)that it has now been removed from the menu. Why???! The cheeses were all perfectly balanced with a fInd array of nuts, herbs, and chutneys that balanced each other oh so perfectly. It makes me sad even reminiscing about it...",5 star rating,Bev D.
4/23/2021,"Alta Mesa, Santa Barbara, CA","I'd been previously and absolutely loved it (didn't have Yelp at the time otherwise I'd have given a good review) but this visit was extremely disappointing. Mostly due to the service, both our starters And mains were brought out separately meaning I waited 10 minutes each time to receive my food whilst my girlfriend had hers. I then had to go up and ask for the bill as once it was clear we'd finished we seemed to get ignored, it's such a shame as I'd thought so highly of it before. I'd consider going back because of my first visit and hopefully, if I do, I'll be able to change this review to a more positive one.",3 star rating,Ben G.
5/1/2021,"Westside, Santa Barbara, CA","I am a regular here but I hate coming on the weekends because my server (the blonde) never does anything the bussers are always the ones helping me out and checking on me, however the food is good so I would recommend coming in on weekdays",3 star rating,Josue L.
11/29/2020,"West Hollywood, CA",This place is fantastic. The Caesar salad is the best I've ever had and I'm not much of a salad person in general. The quesadillas are also phenomenal. Michelin star restaurant for a damn reason!Dog friendly patio and free parking in the lot. Great spot for lunch. The patio is 100% shaded and gets a bit chilly so bring a jacket!,5 star rating,Dori G.
9/19/2019,"Pasadena, CA","This place was great. So great that I can't wait to go back. We decided to give it a try after spending the morning at the beach with our dog. It's right up the street from Arroyo Burro Dog Beach which was perfect for us. Vegetarian places can be tricky, most of them are wonderful, some of them completely miss the mark. Mesa Verde did not disappoint in the slightest.  First, we never went inside so I can't comment on the interior. Outside they have a nice shaded patio that is completely dog friendly. There were at least three dogs, including ours, on the patio while we dined. We opted for the polenta fries and the Empanadas. Both were excellent. Packed with flavor, quite filling and satisfying. I am a big time meat eater who is trying to incorporate more vegetarian meals into his diet. I didn't even think about the fact there was no meat in these dishes. I was so impressed, that half way through my meal I started thinking about all the other things on the menu I'd like to try when we come back. I would 100% recommend Mesa Grill to vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike.",4 star rating,Bob E.
11/28/2020,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA","What an awesome 5 star experience . From being seated quickly all the way to the decadent, scrumptious desserts.

11/26/2020,"Miami, FL","This review is long overdue.I had the pleasure of eating at Mesa Verda a few years back and the food and service was fantastic.

8/30/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Mesa Verde has exquisite and delicious vegan fare perched along Cliff Drive in Santa Barbara. It is a nice cozy place near the ocean with dishes that range from street tacos to burgers to pasta--the plant based options are endless. With a sophisticated menu, the main focus is on meatless dishes for all to enjoy.  The ingredients are locally sourced from five local farms making this place a must visit. Lovely presentation with its vegan, gluten free and organic garnishing with edible flowers and delicious sauces. Classy dinner? That's what you can expect here. They especially know how to treat food like the celebrity. Water was what I ordered with the roasted mushroom umami burger. The burger had smoked onions, pickled turnip, micro greens, and a cashew aioli. Is your mouth watering yet? The burger arrived hot and I couldn't wait to make it disappear. I wasted no time and took a nice bite after I placed my napkin in my lap. I enjoyed it very much as it was perfectly seasoned with love--also activating enzymes and made in the most unexpected way. I only wish they had a gluten free option for the buns but otherwise a lovely dinner experience. The service was wonderful and the restaurant was clean. If you want fresh and locally sourced healthy food look no further as they make eating healthy so easy. Next, I have my eyes on the rajas taco, summer risotto, and gluten green walnut basil pesto pizza. Perhaps something on the desert menu. Seating inside or outside.A quintessential Santa Barbara plantbased restaurant experience.",5 star rating,Dominique D.

1/23/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","This is the best vegan restaurant in California according to Yelp!There was a sign on the wall and after dining here over the weekend, I believe it.We had the lasagna, green bowl, and the chocolate cake. They all were delicious and beautifully prepared. Especially the chocolate cake. I would die for that cake, and I don't even particularly like cake. All the servers were on their A game-- smiling, filling up water, checking if we were ok, and taking empty plates. There's so much variety on the menu-- from tacos and empanadas to pizza and baklava. Everything sounded amazing and I think it'll take quite a few trips to Santa Barbara to try everything. The prices are quite high, but when you're the best you can charge what you like.The vibe is intimate and romantic, good for hot dates with your vegan boo. There's a free private parking lot and clean restrooms, too!",5 star rating,Christina C.

3/11/2021,United Kingdom,GROSS!!!!!   The place has gone to the dogs.  Dog food that is.  The veggie burger was a pile of cold beet mush.  Horrible... 20 bucks out the window.  I could not eat it ....the texture was disgusting and the heirloom tomato was white and hard as a rock.   Inedible...

7/10/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","Phenomenal! Love the purpose, love the place, love the food.Genuine and unique foods made with passion. The most delicious vegan dishes I have ever tried. I was a little hesitant as I do tend to enjoy my red meats and hearty dishes, but boy was I wrong. What I discovered was something completely different and beyond my expectations. The mushroom pasta and veggie bowl were packed with flavor. After one bite of each, I was in awe. I can't seem to get Mesa Verde off the back of my mind. Perhaps another visit is in order.",5 star rating,Rick S.

4/22/2021,"Santa Barbara, CA","I've eaten at Mesa verde for years and always loved it. Unfortunately, when I ate there on April 20th, I got terrible food poisoning. I got the green plant bowl, and it was the second time in a row that it was served cold/lukewarm. My boyfriend's burrito was also kind of cold on the inside. I think maybe they aren't storing the ingredients at the right temperature or something. Sad because it's one of my favorite places but I wouldn't ever risk putting myself through that again.",2 star rating,Amanda W.

6/8/2019,"San Diego, CA","Came here after friends raved, and I'm not quite sure why they were so excited. Yes, it's good, but it's not THAT good. If you're vegan, you should definitely check this place out. If you're not, you may not be so excited.The rajas tacos were a tasty pile of vegetables, but that's really what they tasted like: a pile of vegetables. The lentils, yogurt, and roasted carrots in the carrot garden were delicious, but the crackers were dry and the other carrots were unpleasantly bitter. I enjoyed the polenta fries, but wouldn't call them a must-have. The cheese board was definitely fun! I was really excited to try their cashew cheeses, and they are impressively cheese-like. The soft, spreadable white one was definitely my favorite. I wish they came with a nicer bread instead of those crackers!I actually came here twice in a weekend, and we got good service both times. Not sure where the complaints on that front are coming from!",4 star rating,Akemi W.

7/26/2020,"Santa Barbara, CA","Loved my salad, very fresh, assortment of greens and herbs mixed in. My big issue is the size. For $16 this was way overpriced. It is about the size of a large side salad and I weigh less then 110lbs and I'm hungry 2 hours later. Could they add in more greens, avocado and olives to make this more substantial and like a meal???It's not a meal in itself but very tasty.",4 star rating,Madeline B.
4/30/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Maybe...honestly...truly...the best taco of my life.We stopped here for a quick lunch while driving around Santa Barbara. It's a little off the beaten path - you'll need to drive here if you're staying near State St. But they have parking out front and it's absolutely worth it!We were with our dog and we sat outside, where they had lots of shaded seating. My dog's a bit of a loudmouth but our server wasn't phased. They had a lavender kombucha on draft so I ordered a glass, it was lovely. The lunch menu had so many delicious looking things on it, I asked our server for guidance. ""The street tacos, definitely.""Oh my gosh. Cacao black beans. Jackfruit chorizo. Blueberry chipotle salsa. Garnishes galore. When it was set in front of me, I thought, ""I've never seen such beautiful tacos before."" They were fairly large - I needed to eat a bit of filling with a fork before I could dig in with my hands. But my god, the FLAVOR. It was so complex, so many layers that sang in harmony. I was so impressed!Mesa Verde is officially my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. It's so wonderful and unlike anything I've ever had before.",5 star rating,Shannon R.

3/19/2019,"Denver, CO","I came here a week ago on a day trip up from LA. I had never been to a full-fledged vegan restaurant before Mesa Verde, but let me just say...it left me speechless. My boyfriend and I shared the polenta fries to start, and it was one of the most immaculate dishes I've ever tasted. Sometimes you try a dish and you immediately know that the chef has a sixth sense about how flavors and textures mesh and mingle. This was one of those dishes. Do NOT miss the polenta fries. For our mains, I had the empanadas and Derek had the impossible burrito. Both dishes were just...wow. The flavor profiles of MV's dishes are simply on a higher plane than I'm used to consuming. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is cuisine-as-art. It was also very obvious that they used very fresh ingredients as all of the dishes tasted wonderfully bright and herbaceous. We shared a chocolate cake for dessert, and it was just as stellar as the first three dishes. I just wish I could remember more specifically what was in it, but it made me incredibly happy.There is a common misconception among meat-eaters (my past self included) that a vegetarian/vegan dish could never provide the same level of savory satisfaction that a meat dish does. This notion is simply false. I encourage any self-proclaimed carnivore to come here with an open mind and see if you don't agree. Bonus points: this place is way more affordable than it could be, and I'm so grateful for that. I think the good people of MV want their food to be somewhat accessible to the masses, and I felt little-to-no attitude of elitism here. I LOVE that! The staff was also extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you so much, Mesa Verde. I will be back someday.",5 star rating,Michael H.
8/19/2020,"San Francisco, CA","I really wanted to love Mesa Verde more than I did, but it just didn't blow me away.The things I liked were:- the great menu of hard kombucha options!- delicious salad special with watermelon, melon and tomatoes- The jackfruit street tacos were pretty good - but could have used a bit more freshness to balance out the strong flavorsWhat I didn't love- Like I said the tacos sounded and looked so special, but they didn't blow me away- My husband had the portabello mushroom burger which was really a disappointment.. it turned to mush when pressure was applied to the bun and just didn't taste great either.Love what they're doing overall and excited always to see new vegan restaurants - but I think the execution could have been a bit better.",3 star rating,Juliette L.

4/22/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","A 4 is generous for our visit but the food was wonderful.I visit MV on Easter Sunday with my daughter for a late lunch.  We were able to grab the last parking space in the small parking lot. The rustic and industrial decorated restaurant was not crowded during our visit.  We chose to sit inside as everyone else was outside on the patio.  That was probably a mistake.  After we were seated, we waiting about 10 minutes before we decided to grab our menus ourselves.  The paper menus were slightly worn and could've been cleaner (or replaced) but the items on the menu looked delicious!  There were so many creative and delicious items to choose from. We chose the Mushroom Umami Burger and the Jackfruit Pombazo and a tea (which never arrived).After about 15-20 minutes, our server returned to tell us that the computer malfunctioned and our order was lost.  And there I was hoping he was going to tell us our food was almost ready.  At least he was apologetic...Shortly thereafter, our food arrived.  Both were beautifully plated and bursting with color.  Taste was amazing!  The burger patty was hearty and textured just right. The bread on the patty was lite and moist.  The pombazo was flavorful with a good kick of heat. There were two unisex, single user restrooms that I was not able include in this review as they were occupied when I went to check them out. Our server was super friendly so he saved this rating from a 3.  I'm hoping our experience was a fluke.  We'll try again in a few months...  and we'll sit outside.",4 star rating,Paula F.

Thank you for a great meal! :)It's nestled between the 7-11 and a gas station and a bit hard to spot from the street.

11/30/2018,"Concord, CA","I was traveling with my vegetarian family and happened to stop for lunch at  Santa Barbara. Thanks to Yelp, I found Mesa Verde and decided to give it a shot based off of its reviews. And thank God I did because Mesa Verde did not disappoint!It has an indoor and outdoor seating. While I really liked the outdoor setting, we decided to sit inside as it was a little windy that day. Since we happened to visit on a Saturday afternoon, we got a chance to try their brunch menu. Here's my 2 cents on the dishes that we tried:PICADILLO EMPANADAS - They were nice and crisp on the outside with some delicious stuffing inside. The bed of black beans that they were served on were also cooked well. But the chimichurri on top is what stole the show for me and perfectly complemented the dish.POTATO LATKES - The grated potato pancakes were pretty good but could have been better. It was a little undercooked in my opinion. The picked cucumber on the side was fantastic though.FALAFEL BOWL - This dish was a winner. It didn't only look beautiful but was also packed with flavor with lots of ingredients that worked extremely well with each other. The falafels were amazing too. BAKLAVA - While the baklava in itself was pretty amazing, it was either the pomegranate molasses or the sumac that was probably in excess and added a lot of tart to the dish. But apart from that, I absolutely loved this dessert and is totally worth the hype.Had a pretty good experience on the whole. Would highly recommend to vegan and non-vegans alike!",4 star rating,Ishani S.

I asked for recommendations for my entree, and she said her favorite was the Potato Latkes ($16), so I went with that. I thought it was good, but I loved the Grilled Cheese ($15) that my cousin's husband ordered, so I stole half of his sandwich! It was just perfect comfort food. We also had the Baklava for dessert, which I thought was okay. The ice cream was very tasty and creamy.Overall, the food is very delicious and the service is great.

My husband and I came in for a late lunch and shared the following: Quinoa Avocado Bowl, Vegan BLTA, and the Juniper Smoothie. The BLTA and Juniper Smoothie were both delicious but I didn't much care for the salad that came with the BLTA which was a bit too ruffage-y with a very basic dressing. The avocado bowl looked absolutely beautiful but tasted just okay. Avocado wasn't even the ingredient that shined in the bowl either..maybe a little misrepresented?!

10/23/2020,"Monterey Park, CA","Definitely visit this spot. It received what is essentially an honorable mention from the michelin judges in 2019, and I was thoroughly impressed by the restaurant, even moreso because they are a vegan restaurant. There is plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, all adequately spaced. All the staff are wearing proper PPE. We were seated immediately and promptly served waters. The servers were extremely friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful. We started with the polenta fries. These delightful fried sticks of polenta were crispy on the outside and rich and creamy on the inside. They were covered with a flavorful chili with a slight kick. Definitely a very unique dish that I highly recommend. I had the impossible burrito, and my wife had the umami burger. The umami burger was absolutely phenomenal. I have a hard time describing the skill that went into creating this dish. The buns are warm and freshly toasted. The patty is savory and packs a huge oomph, and it has a lovely sear, just like a beef patty would. The caramelized onions, beet ketchup, and cashew aioli round out the entire bite with sweet notes and creamy texture. I had my doubts walking into this restaurant, and this burger buried all of those second thoughts. My burrito was very good as well. The impossible ""meat"" was seared perfectly into nice crispy bits. The burrito is stuffed with other contents including generous helpings of avocado. Keep in mind this is a bit spicy, probably on the mild-medium side for most people. If you are sensitive to spiciness, this is not the dish for you. I am only docking one star because the trash bin was too close to the outdoor seating area, and the light in one of the bathrooms was not working properly. Altogether, this is definitely a must visit.",4 star rating,Joseph L.

2/1/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","My BF and I was looking for a good vegan place to have lunch while in Santa Barbara on Thursday around 3pm and found this place on yelp. It was bit harder to find because there was plants growing over the sign but once we got inside was pleasantly surprised to how beautiful the space was. The wood details, resin table top and greenery is so delightful.Food is overpriced for what it was. Don't get the hummus and bread because they will give you a boat of hummus with only two pieces of bread. When you ask for more they will charge. The empanadas are ok and sat on a bowl of canned black beans, they did not even tried to flavor it to mask the can flavor. The mushroom burger was a hit! Service is the absolute worst I've seen in a restaurant. You have a bunch of entitled servers who would not clean a dirty table in a empty restaurant for more than 30mins. No table touching and was standing around talking about their own personal lives when guests are inside. We had to ask for napkins and was given two, water was never refilled. When ask for more bread we got it at the end of our meal, a dude come in and set it on the corner of the table (almost fell off) and walked away. They did not even say hello or goodbye to their guests.If you like a beautiful space to go to, sit quietly and experience some mediocre food this is the place. Don't except that your money and presence is appreciated. Don't be surprised to know that the staff there is an absolute joke.",2 star rating,Osanga M.
7/15/2018,"Chino Hills, CA","We got the mushroom burger and the macro bowl. Everything is a bit pricey but that is typical for vegan restaurants. The food felt very fresh (lettuce and greens were crisp and not at all wilted). The mushroom burger could have used more flavor in the actual burger patty, which I suspect had a lot of beets in it as the color was red. The sprouts were a wonderful addition to the burger and the salad dressing was very tangy and enjoyable. Macro bowl was also delicious with black rice and a ton of veggies. After,  we tried the cheesecake which we couldn't believe was vegan. It was firm and looked and tasted very real. The cookie crumbles had a very indian-y taste with pistachios in them. The owner here is so nice!!! After we asked for the bill, he sent over baklava with ice cream which was so delicious -seriously couldn't believe that it was vegan! After he found out I was Yelp Elite he asked us to stay and eat more but we were so stuffed we had to say no! Overall, beautiful restaurant, very friendly service, fresh ingredients, and tasty food (esp dessert wow!). The plating is truly professional here.

9/17/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I met a lovely woman with her dog at Butterfly Beach who recommended this place to me, so I made the drive up again the following weekend to check it out. There was plenty of parking in front when I arrived, but it quickly filled up. Now I know why! I was greeted with a smile by Edgar, and I chose a table on their charming patio, which was surrounded by stunning red flowers that attracted darling yellow butterflies. The filtered water quickly arrived in a mason jar and, after I perused the brunch menu, Edgar enthusiastically approved of my choice of the picadillo empanadas. I watched a few colorful plates go by and soon my dish arrived. After the first bite, I was hooked. The presentation was terrific and the flavors were wonderful. It was a substantial dish but I managed to gobble it all up. Just as I was ready to leave, the owner, Jamal, came by to say hello and said he wanted to bring me something. Lucky me, I got to try a generous sample of the baklava with ice cream and yes, it was as yummy as the many reviews have stated.

4/20/2018,"Thousand Oaks, CA","A couple months ago I was left in distress (no seriously I'm that into pizza) when my favorite items on the menu were taken off. I thought I would most likely not return because the drive to my old hometown, Santa Barbara, is not as close as it once was for some of the best flatbread I've ever had. But what happens when you find yourself in the area and your friends are dying to try vegan cuisine? You go to Mesa Verde and build the courage to try something new!Lo and behold! No courage was needed as I immediately sat down in the beautifully lit patio and saw my old favorites returned on the dinner menu: Gluten Free Tempeh bacon and Brussels sprouts with Cashew cheese and their Fig + Hummus flatbreads (sometimes dates have been used and everytime I have been impressed). Spec-tacular. We were given the Chocolate cake and cashew cheesecake for dessert, the latter being a tad too different for our tasebuds. Regardless, each bite left me questioning past desserts I have had and hoping their was more room in my stomach to try others! My dear friends tried some dishes and were pleasantly surprised that for a place that does not use animal products, the flavors are superb and presentation even better. Not only will you be left craving the food, Mesa Verde provides a setting and environment suitable for all occasions whether it be date night, a lunch date, breakfast, or like me, all of it all of the time....no shame. The staff is extremely helpful and will take the time to explain the unique flavors to those not accustomed to this type of cuisine.Lastly and most importantly, I can not rave enough about the owner. I have been coming to this restaurant for 3+ years, each time bringing new friends and family. His demeanor and dedication to customer satisfaction, especially his regulars such as myself, is unparalleled. I have found it is quite rare to find this in the restaurant business today. 5 stars well deserved to Mesa Verde because of my most recent experience last week (too bad yelp doesn't do 6 stars). Although it is a bit expensive, it is hands-down worth it. I HIGHLY suggest all visit at least once or a hundred times...as I will be now",5 star rating,Sayeh Z.

3/17/2018,"Oxnard, CA","I found Mesa Verde on Yelp months ago, shortly after going plant-Based vegan. What caught my attention was the number of generously positive reviews there were & still are. I am a lover of ALL-THINGS-SANTA-BARBARA & Mesa Verde is one of those iconic Santa Barbara-esque restaurants that blend something that is trendy, but classic. This place is here to stay. The restaurant from the outside, does not seem like the culinary genius that it is. It's a diamond in the rough, but once you come inside, you can easily see it is a gem!The menu was simple. One page. That. Is. It. There is no need to complicate the exquisite food. It spoke to my soul.My husband ordered the Picadillo Empanadas served over a bed of simple black beans & topped with this luscious verdant chimichuri. I ordered the BLTA sandwich, which came with a side of greens with a bright dressing that tasted like sunshine.We ate every crumb & speck of our dishes. If we're in the privacy of our home, we would be licking the insides of our plate & bowl. That delicious.After signing my receipt, the waiter told us the owner wanted to give us a sample of baklava & ice cream. It was explosive in flavor! Lemon ice cream with pistachio baklava with a sweet, tart & lovely lemon flavor that we both wanted to savor. It was the perfect balance of flavor & the sweetness was just right. Again, we would have licked the plate.The owner introduced himself. My husband praised his dessert then casually said, ""my wife will be writing a good review"". He then asked if I was an Elite, in which I replied ""Yes"" & he brought out another dish... the pumpkin cheesecake.The cheesecake was firm & held up its triangular shape. Pieces of a delicious, slightly sweet pistachio cookie were crumbled up & placed on the plate with pieces of plump blackberries & beautiful dark very syrup. The cheesecake crust & the cookie were the same flavor & was a nice repetition of this note. Service was excellent, the vibe was excellent, the decor was simple & subdued. It allowed the flavors of the dishes to be the star. The staff were friendly & very knowledgeable & had the supporting role of allowing the food to be was it is... Divine.Come back, I will. I would come here everyday if I could. And one day I will be brave & lick the plate!",5 star rating,Phyllis M.

Then my fiancé wanted a draft beer but they didn't have any so he got a bottle. The waiter comes back 10 minutes later saying they don't have that one so he had to get another. 15 minutes later I was barely able to order. I ordered the street tacos and bowl. We sat there for 40 minutes waiting for our food. Then the waiter comes back and tells us they sold the last bowl to someone else. Very poor service, they should've told us when we ordered there was no more, not 40 minutes later. We left and asked for the check, after wasting an hr of our time they didn't even compensate the $7 beer. We later couldn't find any other place to eat because everywhere closed down.

6/9/2019,"Santa Clarita, CA","This is a vegetarian's paradise.  Usually there are only a few options on the menu if you don't eat meat, and then half of those are salad.  Here the whole menu is an option.  Each dish is very unique - not easily made at home so I don't mind paying for it at a restaurant.  That said, the prices are very moderate about $14 or so on average so it won't break the bank. The decor is simple - wooden tables - on the causal side.  It's location is  little odd too - sandwiched between a 7-11 and a gas station.  Parking is limited but there is a big shopping center across the street you can use.There are also many vegan options.If you are going with people who do not like vegetarian options - they will be displeased - but if you want some healthier fare ( they have some richer dishes too) this is a fabulous option.",5 star rating,Robin M.

2/4/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I used to be a vegan shamer (feel free to judge me) but since I've started a mission to build a more plant-based diet in 2019 I have been largely proven wrong. And of all the places that I have tried, Mesa Verde is the place that has proven me the MOST wrong.Mesa Verde seems like your average instagramable trendy location with its cute wood and burlap finishings, but it is SO much more than that. Came for a friend's birthday among the three of us we shared the polenta fries, street tacos, grilled cheese, and green bowl. EVERYTHING tasted awesome, but I will say that the street tacos were my personal favorite. The jackfruit served as a carnitas-like substitute and was seasoned perfectly. Additional, the taco shells (not sure what they were made out of honestly) were so flexible and really withstood all the fillings they piled up on them. To give you an idea of how good it was, I started with a knife and fork and finished with my hands. My biggest takeaway was how it was SO FILLING and I don't think it was because we ordered four dishes since we had to take some home. The meals you get here aren't just leaves to eat, this is hearty and wholesome food. Definitely want to come back to Mesa Verde ASAP. Given my sad graduate student budget, I'll have to make this spot a treat when I have some extra cash, but I'm definitely glad to do so.",5 star rating,Donna A.
10/29/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","Okay. So. It's taken me a while to finally review this place because I wanted to give it a few times before I made my decision. The first time was phenomenal. I figured I was just starving. I am vegan. And have eaten a lot of vegan food. I love it. And every single time after was equally as phenomenal. But i was once a non vegan, and it's nearly impossible to find vegan food that is even comparable in taste to most non vegan dishes. This place is off the charts with flavor. The dishes are so unique and bursting with taste. The location is really charming. They have outdoor seating during COVID and dogs are welcome. The staff are SO friendly and location is always clean. The only downside is the very limited parking in the lot. But still totally worth walking 100 miles for. We always ordered their cashew cheese quesadilla (which I think was a winner special) that is just insane. Everything there is amazing. 10 out of 5 stars in my opinion!!",5 star rating,Shane A.

One time I called in the order and another time my husband went in person to place and pickup. Both times we experienced snappy, unfriendly service. For the Polenta Fries, we asked for no chili or at least on the side. The cashier appeared afraid to ask the cook. Seemed like a simple request to us. We would like to return and hope that service improves. They used to be so friendly back when we could dine in.",3 star rating,S R.
10/29/2020,"Santa Maria, CA","I was really disappointed when we went here last weekend. I ordered the California salad and we got it for take out. We then drove up to the beach and walked into the park. We opened the bag and there was no silver wear. I was shocked- how can I eat a salad with no fork? What restaurant wouldn't put silverware in the take out bag? My husband left me there and walked all the way back to the car and drove all the way back to the restaurant. The whole experience was really frustrating. Then I opened my salad and I was even more disappointed. The salad was barely filling the container. I just feel like with take out they give you half the food for the full price. After eating it I was still hungry and had to go home for more food. It tasted fine, just so disappointed in the quantity and the cost for still needing to eat again. But I wonder if they give you enough to fill you up in the restaurant or if it's just a take out issue. I feel like with the covid era they should really have the same quality and quantity especially when they are charging you the same price. Overall a very frustrating experience.",2 star rating,Erica M.

Then there was some confusion where a group found a table and since the staff hadn't started a list of names for people who were waiting, they were seated before a group that came before them. I wish that this restaurant would take reservations during this restricted dining situation to make things smoother. Once seated, the service was a little slow and we didn't get utensils for a while but staff was nice. We got the hummus flatbread, the Brussels sprouts, the rajas tacos and the street tacos. The capers under the Brussels sprouts were a little salty but the fava bean purée was really nice. I didn't care for the cashew cheese on the street tacos but once that was off, they were fantastic. The blueberry salsa was an unexpected surprise. Will be coming back to try even more.",5 star rating,Molly M.
9/20/2019,"Summerland, CA","Favorite vegan place ever. Including all the places that I've tried in LA. Me and my (meat-lover) boyfriend come here whenever we want to treat ourselves. You definitely don't need to be vegan to enjoy this place. I believe they have different menus for lunch, brunch, and dinner. I'd wait for dinner to come. I'm always impressed with the quality and complexity of flavors. Like how do they make sweet potatoes taste that good?! They're a little pricy, but still price performant in my opinion. The only time I've felt a little ripped off is when they decreased the size of the cheese board and kept the price the same. Deserts are kinda expensive for the small portions, but the cheesecake is one of my favorite vegan desserts. I really like how their menu tends to change seasonally, because at once point, me and my boyfriend had gone through basically everything on the menu (nothing was bad). It's nice that I can look forward to new things to try. Oh and they have house-made kombucha. I genuinely get excited to eat here!!",5 star rating,Cynthia M.
10/21/2019,"San Diego, CA","I am very happy we found Mesa Verde on Yelp on a recent weekend trip to Santa Barbara!  It's right on the way either from or to the dog beach. We are very healthy food eaters so a vegetarian highly rated place is going to stick out. I can't imagine a better one in Santa Barbara. It has a Michelin Guide sticker on the front door and it definitely deserves it and didn't disappoint. It's one of those places where you could close your eyes and make a selection because all the pictures of the menu items look good. We decided on the polenta fries, the street tacos, the hades smoothie and the baklava. Our favorite was the polenta fries and the hades smoothie.  The smoothie is expensive at $10 but it's the best one I can ever remember having. All the desserts looked good but it seemed like there were the most pictures of baklava and I don't think you will be disappointed. There are so many cool ingredient combinations, colors and flavorful bites there will never be a dull moment at Mesa Verde.

The parking lot was near full, and outdoor seating completely full, but indoors worked for us. Our server Sarah G. was friendly and knew the menu well. She directed us to great choices - potato latkes with tempeh ""bacon,"" avocado, and pea shoots; jackfruit empanadas with chimichurri sauce over forbidden black rice; The Sun smoothie (mango, tahini, banana, maca, ginger, and turmeric); and Artemis brew (raspberry leaf, hibiscus, rose petal, pau d'arco, and St. John's Wort tea). Everything was *perfect*. They gave us a taste of the baklava and vanilla soy ice cream with pistachios, sumac, and pomegranate molasses. We managed to leave without licking the plates.For two entrees and two beverages, expect ~$60 including tip for two people.

7/15/2019,"Los Angeles, CA","After reading stellar reviews about this place on Yelp and TripAdvisor, my companion and I were eager to give this place a try.  He (a vegetarian) and I (an adventurous omnivore) had recently gone together to the amazing, plant-based Plant Food + Wine in Venice, CA, so perhaps our expectations were a little too high. But both of us kept joking throughout the meal that the food was basically just ""acceptable."" It wasn't special, or unique, nor did it particularly showcase its vegetable ingredients.   We started with the cashew cheese board, which while it looked pretty enough with its little purple edible flowers, didn't taste like anything special.  The cheeses all had similar paste-like texture of cashew, and weren't sufficiently differentiated in flavor. Then, we had jackfruit tacos which were fine, but unexceptional.  Next,for an entree, he had a spicy fettuccine with roasted tomato that could have been served at any basic Italian restaurant; and I had a chickpea socca (basically like a tortilla made of garbanzo beans) topped with a salad, avocado and tahini.  It was a dish with basically two flavors/ textures - mushy (socca, avocado, sauce) and crunchy (lettuce) - which didn't particularly complement or contrast each other well.  I barely touched the socca, and mostly just ate the salad. The food was not only unexceptional, but so was the service and ambiance.  Our server was mostly absent, unenthusiastic about describing the menu options, and seemed stricken by ennui.  And it was rather chilly out there on the patio, despite the heat lamp.   There was really no ""vibe"" to speak of, which is sad in Santa Barbara (full of vibey hangouts). We ended up spending $100 on two appetizers, two entrees, two glasses of wine (for him), one spiked kombucha (for me) and a chai tea (also me). A little pricey for the mediocrity of the experience. Bottom line: While the food wasn't terrible, all in all the experience was just ""meh."" I wouldn't return.",3 star rating,Stacey A.

We absolutely loved it.The two of us enjoyed a nice outdoor table on a warm summer day, and I ordered a blood orange kombucha to quench my thirst. The restaurant is vegetarian, but mostly vegan. We each decided to get different tacos. I opted for the street tacos, which included, among other things, jackfruit ""chorizio"" and a blueberry chipotle salsa. WOW. So good, and such interesting flavors all put together. The order comes with two VERY loaded tacos, all on a homemade corn  tortilla. My friend got the rajas tacos, which also looked great. We were both jealous of each others choices so made the smart decision to make a trade so that we got one each. I loved the rajas tacos too - spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. My non-veg friend raved about everything as well!The presentation here is what's totally killer. Our tacos looked like works of art, and it was tough to tear them apart so quickly.

8/6/2019,"Beachwood, OH","Horrible service and average food. I was recommended to this place by a employee at our hotel. I am vegan and my husband is full carnivore, but obliged for me. We looked online at the menu prior to deciding on this restaurant. Upon finally receiving our menus after ordering drinks ( because none were available at seating ... approx 20 minutes later) it was not the menu online. We ordered our drinks which the wine came out fairly quickly but my chai took the 20 minutes ( came about when the menu arrived) and upon arrival the waitress forgot to bring honey and a cup. Our actual waitress didn't return to our table to take our order or so we could ask for a cup for about another 5 minutes. We finally ordered the linguini and tacos and as a appetizer the Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts came out fairly quickly and were flavorful. The linguini was cooked extremely well and quite good. The issue was with the tacos and service. I had a slight allergic reaction to the tacos. The waitress showed absolutely no concern and didn't come back to our table for another 25 minutes. We had finished and were waiting to leave for almost 30+ minutes for our check. I could understand if the restaurant was extremely busy, but that was not the case. I love supporting any vegetarian or vegan restaurants, especially privately operated.

6/29/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Disclaimer: If you have lived in LA or Portland or anywhere else where good gastro vegan can be found you will be slightly underwhelmed by this place, given the limited drink and food menu and frankly, this is not the place for strict vegans - if you want to get into the scrutiny of vegan vs. plant centric of honey and wine distillation methods etc...That being said: it's pretty good.  Service is great- friendly and quick. Only one suggestion I would offer would be for the waiters to be a bit more sensitive of the timing- our starter and mains came at the same time leaving the latter dish luke-warm upon eating. Also the water cups were a nice touch but never refilled and harder to get the waitresses attention as the restaurant filled. The ambiance is sweet and casual enough to where your comfy clothes but trendy and cute enough to have a romantic date and for a nice dinner for two with a bottle of wine you are looking at about $100, not bad if you consider the other options in town.For starters: The Cashew Nut Cheese Board, this is one of those things you order for your grandparents (or French friends) and just don't tell them it's vegan- the board is beautiful artistically composed pieces of dried fruit and nuts, fig and wine gel, a variety of tasty pickled bites and a couple varieties of sharp nut cheese sure to encourage any cheese lover to consider it worthy of a place on the coveted cheese board.Mains: Portobello Mushroom Tacos- Good and sure this is a thing you could easily and cheaply ,make at home but what this dish lacks in uniqueness it makes up for in presentation- again beautifully plated, whole avocado, carrot shavings, onions and spices. Everything fresh that leaves you perfectly satiated and doing the happy tummy dance.Flatbreads are all good but ehh could be missed.All in all we left feeling happy and healthy at a price point that was reasonable ($85 for two- bottle of wine, starter, 2 Mains, no desert) .

I feel like many vegan/vegetarian places can lean heavily on plant-based ""meat"" alternatives but Mesa Verde highlights the beauty of well seasoned and artfully prepared vegetables. Everything tastes so fresh! I ordered the green bowl and oh my goodness was it delicious. Lentils and wild rice aren't normally foods people would describe as powerful but the way they're prepared in this bowl really anchors the other ingredients. I could easily eat this everyday and never tire of it. The service was beyond excellent. From the moment I walked in the staff was so welcoming and they really treat you like you're the most important person they've seen all day.

10/4/2019,"Santa Barbara, CA","I reviewed Mesa Verde years ago, but I don't see my review, so I'm posting again.  The food is still excellent, and many of my favorites are still on the menu.  One standout entree is the polenta fries.My favorite dessert is the creme brulee. I take non-vegetarian friends here and they love it. They make everything from scratch,  all the way.  The Arnold Palmer, they squeeze the lemons to make lemonade. The candied nuts on the creme brulee, they candied the nuts. If something is smoked on the menu, they smoked it. That attention to detail and quality-  it's part of what makes each plate delicious.  Service is friendly and cheerful. One of best vegetarian restaurants I've been to, in any city.",5 star rating,F S.

12/7/2016,"Alexandria, VA","Tonight was the first time I've been to Mesa Verde. If you're the type of person who consumes Taco Bell and McDonalds on a daily basis, this may not be the restaurant for you.This place is pretty cozy, and has a nice ambiance to it. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and gave my friends and I suggestions on what her favorite meals are. We ordered the brussel sprouts, street tacos, polenta fries, empanadas, and pizza. The flavors are very bold for each dish, which is great considering sometimes I feel like restaurants don't know what to do with super healthy vegetarian food.My favorites were the polenta fries and the brussel sprouts. The street tacos were flavorful but I didn't love the texture of the jackfruit. Some people say that it tastes just like pulled pork, but the texture didn't work for me. The brussel sprouts were crunchy- just the way I like them! The polenta fries were crispy, and the olives and beans had a nice pairing-flavor to them.I also really loved their chai tea. It was brewed nicely. Took a while, but that's just the process to amazing chai I guess!I would recommend this place to a vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free or meat eater! The spices are no joke and your taste buds will really be amazed.",5 star rating,Jennie K.
4/30/2018,"Ventura, CA","I am a vegetarian and stumbled across a review for Mesa Verde by chance. I dont write many reviews and only when I am very impressed with the establishment. This place is amazing and I would eat here every day if I lived closer. The food is spectacular in its presentation, ingredients and flavor! The food was served quickly and looked so good I felt obligated to take pictures of it.The decor is relaxed and our server Hilary was polite, knowledgeable, friendly and answered our questions about the menu. The menu has many selections and I can not wait to go back and try them all. My wife and I had the polenta fries for starters, which was outstanding. She had the King Oyster (mushroom) Steak and I had the Rajas Tacos, which were spicy and good. WOW, the flavor on both dishes was so exciting I felt as if I was being bad! So many healthy ingredients assembled to make the most jaded foodie salivate!To finish the evening off we had the Saffron Cheese Cake which was another masterpiece of culinary art. Everything was so good I asked to speak to the owner to thank him and the chef for such a fantastic dining experience. Do yourself a favor and try out this fabulous restaurant and you will not be disappointed. Eating healthy can be not only good for you but exciting at Mesa Verde!",5 star rating,Robert W. G.
10/18/2016,"San Francisco, CA",First stop in my little weekend getaway to Santa Barbara. I searched top restaurants via Yelp and came across this place. The photos looked amazing and I'm pescetarian so it was a perfect match! I was surprised when I pulled up and it was situated between a gas station and a 7-11 but once you're inside you can't even tell. Looks like a little zen utopia when sitting outside! Everything on the menu looked amazing and the food looked even better when it came out! We got the Umami Mushroom Burger and Macro Bowl. We also got the Sun smoothie with the optional hemp seeds. Bomb! Thought there was a little too much bread on my burger but we finished it all anyways. This is the kind of restaurant I wish we had in San Francisco and really surprised we don't have such a place considering all the veggie hippies we have. The macro bowl could be more macro if that makes sense. I've had much better at the Apple cafeteria no less but still yummy. I have to say the salad is the most intricate I've ever seen in my life. All sorts of random greens I've never even seen before and I loved it. Felt so healthy. Only real complaint I have is I asked the waitress for hot sauce and she straight up said there was no hot sauce in the restaurant. I was all oh okay and then saw the table next to us get hot sauce wtf. I asked another waiter for hot sauce and he immediately brought me out some. It was house made and so good! Went perfect with my burger. The owner came and talked to us after our meal and hooked us up with their baklava which happens to me one of my favorite desserts. So freaking nice! We were stuffed but ate as much of it as we could. I immediately told ten different people about this place and its a must go!,4 star rating,Tiffany S.

9/2/2018,"ASTORIA, NY","4&1/2 stars and almost 1000 reviews did not steer us wrong tonight! Came in with a craving for healthy vegan food and tacos, and am on food cloud 9 as a result. Plus, the owner and staff were all so friendly and sweet, even though we snuck in as they were closing. The food: 5/5 incredible- I'd rate it higher if I could. We ordered the street tacos (sans jalapeño, we have no spice tolerance) and modified the hummus pizza, adding macadamia ricotta instead of the hummus. The street tacos were incredibly flavorful, and were huge - easily two tacos worth of food in each. The blueberry chipotle compote on them was he perfect amount of spice without making the fish intolerable - perfect! The pizza (which we had on the gluten free crust, they were out of the normal crust) was incredible - savory and sweet, and the first time I've had anything like ricotta since I realized my dairy allergy 3 years ago! The surprise dessert on the house at the end made this meal perfect, the baklava was just as good as were used to in NYC! It was the right amount of sweet and creamy, with the pomegranate molasses glaze adding exactly the right dash of sour. Plus it was free- it doesn't get any better!Can't wait to come back on our next visit to SB!",5 star rating,Samantha M.

11/21/2019,"San Diego, CA","My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for a quick get away to celebrate his birthday.  We got there on Tuesday and had lunch at Mesa Verde, the food were so incredible delicious, we were delighted with all the options we chose.  We ordered Street Tacos, Green Plant Bowl and Picadillo Empanadas, everything was delicious, super tasty and well made.  Next day we came back for the dinner menu, we were too impressed with the food.  And the dinner was sooooo good too... we ordered Gluten-free vegan lasagna and fetuccini.  Both were delicious... but the lasagna is the winner... and to close the night we had chocolate cake for desert... Being a vegan, there is nothing that makes me more happy than finding a good place to eat, but this one is beyond expectations.   I can't recommend Mesa verde enough.... Go there and you wont regret...... Ahhh and the staff are super helpful and friendly :-) This is my place to go whenever I'm in Santa Barbara.   Thank you Mesa  Verde for making our vacation even better.",5 star rating,Cleia T.

2/19/2018,"Santa Clara, CA","Lets talk about the food and get it out of the way. The food here is brilliant! Ordered Polenta fries - Outstanding. 6 sticks of fried polenta, topped with white beans, tomato and lot of goodies. Mushroom Lasagne - Very good. A piping hot skillet filled with marinara, mushrooms and lots of other goodness.Baklava dish - The Baklava dish is not a dessert but a work of art. I am not a fan of Baklava, and I was fighting till the end to get tiny last scrap it. Soft melt in the mouth Baklava is served a la mode with soy icecream and a lemony sauce and topped with nuts and flower petals. I cant find the perfect adjective for it!Panna cotta was very good. Very nice presentation and lovely flavours. (If i had to choose between the 2 i would choose Baklava!)Now the tough part - They can up their service a bit. Our Lasagne arrived 40 mins after our order. No waitress had the curtesy to inform us that the Lasagne will take 40 mins to cook. When we got attention of a waitress, she was pretty rude. The owner of the establishment is a saving grace. He is super cool. He checked into our order, came to our table and apologized with a plate of the Baklava dessert and we chit chatted a bit. This place is super duper busy, so be prepared for a wait! All in all a great place for vegan and vegetarians.",4 star rating,Priyam G.

8/27/2016,"Minneapolis, MN","Mesa Verde is the best place to eat in Santa Barbara, and I like that it's far from downtown, because it improves the atmosphere//ambiance.You wouldn't guess how tranquil this place is, given that it's sandwiched in a stripmall between a 7-11 and a gas station. Its outside patio is quiet and lovely.We got the empanada ($13) and I enjoyed it---it's crispy and savory, but feels healthy and wholesome at the same time. The ingredients in this dish are top-notch. I only wish the jackfruit filling had been seasoned more boldly. The BLTA flatbread ($12) was also great and is basically a breakfast sandwich. I got mine without dijon, but it still was delicious. The bread, in particular, was a marvel---soft, warm and rustic. I could eat this all day. The side salad was wonderful, too. We also had their homemade chai ($4) and homemade coffee alternative made with chicory ($4), both of which were delicious. They're served with homemade almond milk which they even lightly warmed up, which is a classy and rare touch.Lastly, for dessert we had the chocolate brownie ($10?) which was spectacular: rich brownie with amazing peanut brittle and a creamy ganache on the side. One of the best desserts I've had in a long while.The service was excellent and friendly. I'll be back whenever I'm in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Kedar D.
8/25/2016,"Destin, FL","My feelings for this venue are like a tossed salad: Saucy and slimy to where I can't really get a definitive grip, but refreshing and up in the air to the point where I like the light feeling of it all and want to keep mixing. Let me explain... This place is all vegan so the salad metaphor is maybe more literal than I had originally planned. They get very creative with their dishes and definitely make them to a fine perfection, however at the end of the day you really have to have an interest for the specific kind of food they are marketing, and the pocketbook to be able to afford it. They have a different menu for each time of the day during the week and a separate menu for the weekend. All of which they seem to change every so often so don't be set on a certain item you see through a picture of the menu online, because there is no certainty that is in shop after the posted date of that picture. I have been by only a few times for Lunch, trying the Mushroom Umami Burger, Grilled Cheese, and Rajas Tacos. All were filling and decently satisfying but none making me jump out of my seat and giving me cravings to come back. Out of the three, however, I have to give the Grilled Cheese its proper appraisal as I was shocked at how well the cashew cheese filled in for regular cheese, and the way the mustard, pickles, and sourdough all perfectly combined as texture and flavor. Fair warning, that horseradish is STRONG! I love that kind of stuff but if you're not into a full clearance of your sinuses after one bite I'd maybe request they don't put horseradish on it. While visiting this most recent time, my guests and I tried the fake coffee elixir drink made from dandelion and licorice roots, and containing a whole bunch of natural gut remedies in it (with no actual coffee in the mix). While it tasted nothing like coffee, I thoroughly enjoy sipping it and the relaxing state it left me in post ingesting it. Mesa Verde is great at what they do, and while the service could use a little more smiles and fast pace, I understand the vibe they are trying to set and the target market they are going for. I definitely recommend a visit at least once, though, no matter who you are.",4 star rating,Dani N.
12/31/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Mesa Verde is a great place for vegans and vegetarians! They have so many amazing options on food as well as a great beer and wine selection too! They even have kombucha on tap which is always the best!I've tried their jackfruit tacos, the falafel bowl, the vegan BLTA, and the banana date smoothie! All of these things are incredible with so much flavor and are delicious. I even forgot that the vegan BLTA was even vegan while I was eating it. This most recent time I went to Mesa Verde I got the vegan cheese plate and the Macadamia Ricotta pizza! Both were incredible! The cheeee tasted like really cheese and it was so smooth with so much flavor. I'm trying to stay away from dairy so this was a great choice for me. The Macadamia Ricotta pizza was really good! It was plain so I added some olive oil to it and it totally made the dish incredible!Overall Mesa Verde is an amazing place to eat vegan and vegetarian options in SB. They have lunch and brunch as well as dinner so check their hours for those choices. I can't wait to come back to try the empanadas soon as I've heard they are to die for!",4 star rating,Stephanie W.

The first time we went we had the Green Bowl. It was full to the brim with the flavors of avocado, lentils and roasted veggies. The second time there, despite loving the Green Bowl, I tried the Jackfruit Street Tacos. Wow! They were spicy and delicious topped with a wonderful mustard sauce. Amazing. The restaurant is all wood interior with inside and outside seating. The service was excellent, and they knew we were hooked when we came back the very next day.

Our waiter was also very nice and friendly and helped us picked out the dishes I was debating between. My boyfriend and I shared the empanadas and the impossible burrito. Both were delicious but WOW, hands down my vote goes to the Empanadas. They were so flavorful and crunchy and surprisingly filling. Also plenty of drink options. We came right at lunch around 12:30 and the lot was full(it's pretty small) even though the restaurant was not so keep in mind when coming at busier times like dinner.

1/15/2018,"Goleta, CA","This place was a super great find! My mom is vegan so the menu is perfect for vegans and vegetarians that don't want to be limited to a few options. I had the street tacos and they were great and a very sizable portion - we had leftovers to bring home. My mom loved the vegan lasagna. The only downside was this place was super busy but might have been understaffed because our server (who was very nice and helpful) was not around as quickly as necessary. We waited about 10-15 minutes to order dessert. However, the dessert was definitely worth it! The panna cotta tasted delicious and was a nice treat to share.Another downside is that the parking lot is very small. The shared parking lots all have these hostile signs saying ""don't park here for the restaurant"" ... as if 711 really needs 15 parking spots. Just FYI - parking isn't super easy if it's a busier time and you might have to park across the street near McDonald's.",4 star rating,Madison C.

The menu was small but everything sounded delicious (plus most dishes are vegan and/or gluten free)! We ordered:Umami Mushroom burger: soooo good! The burger was served on a flatbread! It was tasty and filled with textures! The side of salad was a nice touch to the decor but didn't add anything to the burger. Breakfast bowl with falafel and a poached egg: yumm!! The bowl is colorful for the eyes and tastebuds! I really liked the flavor of pickled beet with mixed salad, wheat (grain?), hummus, and poached egg. You got slaty, sour, sweet, and savory all in one bowl! This reminded me of a bibimpap! HeheheRose lemonade: your typical lemonade with a hint of Rose. It's a pretty color and enhances a nice picture!Service: awesome! Everyone was so nice and they constantly checked on us to make sure our water glasses were full. Cleanliness: the tables weren't all cleaned and dishes still on the tables when we arrived.

Mesa Verde looked promising.I ordered the wheatberry brunch bowl with vegan sausage patties. I didn't order a smoothie or juice but I instantly regretted my decision as I watched the waiter bring out these amazing-looking drinks to our neighboring table.They must have noticed the look of regret on my face because towards the end of our meal, I believe it was the owner who stopped by, and gave us each a glass of complimentary juice to try. It was a carrot, strawberry, pineapple, coconut water juice. Yummmm it really hit the spot.My brunch bowl was fantastic as well. Definitely tasted healthy, and had a bit of a spicy kick.

The grilled radicchio was unpalatable.  The soft poppy r&b music was weird and not helping the hip vibe they display with all the rustic decor.

We sat on the patio and although the parking lot is right out front, you'd never notice as they've done a wonderful job of surrounding the patio setting with little trees. My hubby and I shared a Caesar salad. It was presented beautifully and had caper berries, which were new to me. There was too much dressing for my taste, I know that's just me, as I like just a lighter touch. We had not yet finished our salad when the falafel sandwich arrived for my hubby and the mushroom burger arrived for me.  This was the first time we've seen an open faced falafel, again, beautifully presented, just thought it was a was a regular sandwich from the menu description.   My hubby also ordered a Hades smoothie, a combo of espresso, soy ice cream bananas, cinnamon and raw cacao which was presented in a mason jar.We were both so stuffed at this point when the we were given a complimentary dessert of baklava.

The polenta fries were the other star of the day.

Mesa Verde is just that special and, you most certainly do NOT have to be vegan to be swept away.  Always a thrill to introduce new people to MESA VERDE. It just never disappoints, seemingly always finding new ways to delight. Took a serious vegan foodie from Maui yesterday.

11/27/2019,"Santa Ynez, CA",Mesa Verde is exquisite for any vegetarian or vegan in town. It is my treat spot. On the pricier side but it's absolutely warranted. I can not describe how amazing the flavors of each dish are. Many rare ingredients I have not heard of but somehow each dish is crafted into perfection. I love sitting outside by the plants and enjoying a place where I can literally eat everything in the menu. Love love love Mesa Verde!,5 star rating,Vane R.

11/3/2015,"Bentonville, AR","I was driving to Southern California from San Francisco one day and stopped at this awesome place to meet some friends on the way home!PARKING/WAIT:It was a rainy Sunday and there was no wait. My friends got there a head of me, but were able to sit when they got there. There is a parking lot out front with a decent amount of parking.CUSTOMER SERVICE:Our waiter was very nice and helpful.FOOD:This is a ""modern, plant based"" restaurant. I try to eat mostly vegan, so I love finding restaurants like this. They use organic and local ingredients. Their menu is unique and delicious! I obviously did not try everything, but just reading the menu items made my mouth water and stomach excited haha.I got the Picodilla empanadas with cashew cheese, cacao black beans, chimichurri, pickled savory cabbage and carrots. It was delicious!I would definitely go back.",5 star rating,Summer C.
10/2/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","The food here is really quite good. I'm not a vegan, but I do enjoy tasty things, and we ended up here late on a Friday night on our way home from Santa Barbara back to LA.My friend is vegan, and she felt there were an overwhelming amount of choices, so she was pretty happy. She got a harissa cauliflower dish she proclaimed as delish.I got the macro bowl because I have to eat low FODMAP, and I needed to be able to pull things off like onions. It was really good.Here's the pain in the butt part: parking. It's located in a weird place, which is between a 7/11 and a gas station, and there are signs everywhere that say you'll be towed if you park at 7/11. However, THERE'S LIKE ZERO PARKING FOR THE RESTAURANT. We saw no valet (is there one? No idea) and basically circled a few times just to try to figure out if we should go someplace else or what. You can't even park on the street in the surrounding area because it's a main highway/throughway for that area of town. We got lucky and someone pulled out, but if that hadn't happened, we would not have ended up there, and given we don't know the area, we probably would have gotten something quick on the way home.",4 star rating,Christie C.
12/10/2018,"San Jose, CA","I'm salivating just thinking back to the meal we had at MV during our trip up to Northern California. This is an artisan vegan joint nestled right next to a busy intersection/gas-station, but the ambiance upon entering through the thoughtfully crafted trellis is earthy and welcoming. The food is absolutely top-notch - I got the jackfruit tacos along with a kombucha on tap (10/10) while my date ordered the chicory root coffee with almond milk along with a California salad (8/10). We split dessert - a glass of The Sun (mango, banana, tahini, turmeric, ginger, maca and raw honey) & the mindblowing (12/10) Ice-cream & baklava with a hibiscus/pomegranate finish. A cold shower is going to have to hold me over until I can get back up to SB and to Mesa Verde. Can you guys please build another one close to me, ideally in OC?",5 star rating,Manas G.
8/25/2018,"Long Beach, CA","Cuddle up readers. I'm about to go in about the glorious deliciousness that is Santa Barbara's, Mesa Verde. First of all, I read some of the previous reviews and I'd just like to comment that if someone is turned off by food just because it's labeled 'Vegan' but haven't even tried it, how valid of a review is it? I'll share that I am plant-based and from Los Angeles (LBC and The 'Wood). I eat ALL over Southern California dining at all sorts of vegan friendly restaurants. Mesa Verde has now become one of my favorite, if not the best, Santa Barbara vegan restaurant I've ever ate in. I'll post pics of my food after the review.Firstly, the customer service and greeting were amazing. I literally felt the love walking into the space. It was around 230p or so on a Saturday when I walked in.  I was immediately told by Edgar, my awesome server, that I could sit whereever I wanted. So, I sat briefly and then soon after  the owner Jamal came and asked if had any questions. Of course I did! I was given their Sat/Sun brunch menu but had seen Brussels on the menu from yelp. The manager was totally accommodating and whipped them up for me super fast.I then asked for his opinion on which tea and entree I should get as it's my first time and was already getting the Brussels. He suggested the burger and it was an amazing decision. Definitely check out my photos from this place.1. Mesa Verde's Brussels Sprouts are changing the Brussel game entirely. This dish slaps you all over your face and in your mouth with flavor. There's pumpkin seeds for texture, dill for taste and aroma, caper berries, pickled onions, all placed atop this amazing Fava bean puree, whicb is definitely one of the reasons these Brussels set themselves  apart from any other Brussels Sprout I've eaten. Trust when I say I eat mad Brussels when I go out to eat.  These are unlike any your mouth has experienced. 2. Artemis tea is soooooooooooooooo divine and feminine. It felt as  if I could feel the tea coursing through my blood stream. I was told this could be due to the St. John's Wort.  I wouldn't say this tea is strictly for women as it has lotsa mood and immune boosting properties that make it good for all. 3. The friggin Mushroom Umami burger is OUTSTANDING. If I knew the burger would keep to my travel back to LA I would have saved half, but with how soft and fresh that bread was, the burger and accompanying salad had to be eaten right then and there. From the super soft and warm fresh pita/Naan like bread that it's served on, to the beautifully colored homemade beet ketchup, to the fresh locally sourced sprouts greens vegetable colors on the salad, to the undeniable savory flavor of the actual pattie, I was in for a full blown flavor explosion. Oh wait! The damn Cashew Cheese on the burger is to die for. It's not trying to taste like American cheese we're used to on a burger. It's cool just doing its own thing amazing your taste buds in all ways. The final thing I'll mention is the juice the burger left behind. It wasn't something I was used to seeing from a vegan burger. But it was mushroom juicy goodnessz so I sopped it up with my final burger bite. 4. The meal was rounded out with the most delectable Vegan Baklava I've ever had. It's been years since I've had it. This was paired with a super tasty vegan vanilla ice cream. Forgive me for not snapping a photo of it before I demolished/inhaled the dessert. It was sprinkled with pistachio, sumac, and some other delicious and aesthetically pleasing garnish. I definitely got caught licking all the goodness of the plate!In closing, my server Edgar and the owner Jamal made this a top notch Saturday brunch decision. I will be commuting here from LA, on a regular. Only on Saturday and Mon-Thur when Edgar has his shifts. It's really THAT damn good. Thank you for your time and for reading my review.THANK YOU as well to Jamal and Edgar for such a wonderful dining experience. See y'all soon!",5 star rating,L'lia T.
9/27/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Mesa Verde is easily one of the best, most flavorful and hearty vegetarian restaurants that I have ever been to, period. Every dish seems thoughtfully seasoned and consciously presented in order to intrigue ones' tastebuds and draw out the natural flavors and textures in the food. My favorite dishes are the pulled mushroom tacos and pulled mushroom sandwich. The mushrooms are meaty and tender, seasoned with smoked spices reminiscent of bacon, with pickled vegetables. The corn tortillas are soft, thick and clearly handmade. It's the stuff food cravings are made of. Very good!I also really enjoy the polenta fries. Crispy and golden on the outside, warm and moist inside. They are topped with an array of sautéed vegetables. This dish as well, is perfectly seasoned. The customer service at Mesa Verde is generally very good. The owners, understandably, convey a genuine pride in their restaurant and know it can deliver a 5 star experience. (And if they can tell you're a Yelper by your snapping of food pics, they certainly don't mind telling you, ""5 stars!"" with a playful smile.) It shows that they care about the customer's experience and the quality of their food. Often times, they'll walk by and offer you samples of their fresh pressed juices, they are so refreshing and nutrient dense! I love the beet carrot. The location of the restaurant itself is on a busy section of Cliff Drive in an area of Santa Barbara, we call ""The Mesa."" It is perched next to a 7/11 in a strip mall-like cluster of businesses, however, they did a wonderful job of planting shrubby in front of their patio which creates the feeling of a tropical oasis and is quite lovely. Parking in the restaurant's parking lot can be tough as 7/11 has the majority of the parking spaces, but don't fret las or lad, there is plenty of parking nearby on Meigs Road. Whether you're a carnivore, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan or just nutrition conscious like me, you'll find plenty of food at Mesa Verde that will tickle your fancy. Go get some!",5 star rating,Danah W.
10/25/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","I highly recommend this restaurant for vegans and non-vegans alike. This food is incredible. Fresh. Flavorful. Filling. There is a wide variety of offerings to satisfy any craving. My personal favorites are the Pulled Smoke Mushroom Sandwich (for all of the meat eaters out there: you won't even realize this is meatless!), the Falafel Sandwich (mint, savory flavors, and lightly pickled beets are a killer flavor combination), and the Rajas Tacos (so filling. If I get this for lunch I know that I also have enough for dinner later!). The owners are friendly and take great pride in their food... and it shows! If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. PS their teas, kombuchas, and dessert are all worth adding to your order!",5 star rating,Kiki E.
9/16/2015,"Long Beach, CA","Our weekend trip in Santa Barbara ended on a delicious note after we had the most amazing meal at Mesa Verde!Met up with friends for a double date late lunch after researching the online menu and drooling over the potential options. We were a bit sad to find out that the regular menu was not available at the time of our arrival. Luckily their Sunday brunch menu sounded just as intriguing. I was also happy to see that every single item on the brunch menu, except for one item, was marked vegan.Typical move, the Meateater BF ends up ordering the one non-vegan item. He had the Huaracha Azteca which had jackfruit chorizo, black beans, tomatoes, onion slaw and chipotle salsa on flatbread and topped with a fried egg. He seemed to enjoy it. All I know is one minute, this plate was placed in front of him and the next minute the plate was empty.Our friends ordered the BLTA and Avocado Toast. The BTLA (bit.ly/1LicxYo) had marinated tempeh bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado on flatbread. The Avocado Toast was like the mother of all avocado toast! Hands down, this one wins for visual presentation as I was not expecting to see a mountain of ingredients. Thick slice of sourdough topped with cucumber, pickled onion, and jalapeño chili aioli. bit.ly/1NyUBZGI ordered the Picadillo Tacos because I love me some jackfruit! It also had tempeh, pickled onion, apple, and blackberries. The taco ""shell"" was a lettuce leaf and the presentation was pretty artsy as well. bit.ly/1KisNVeBut the real star of the meal was the soup of the day. A Creamy Roasted Cauliflower Soup made with cashew cream, cauliflower, an essence of smokiness without being overpowering and other spices that I couldn't quite put my finger on. All I know is that everybody at the table kept dipping their spoons into this giant bowl of deliciously savory soup. bit.ly/1KhNWAVGood food, good company, good atmosphere! Loved dining on the front patio. Service was great and friendly as well. Mesa Verde will be a must for me next time I'm in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Harmonie T.
9/2/2018,"Escondido, CA","OMG.....what isn't there to love about this place?  Let me tell you why.  First off, this place is gorgeous with a rustic vibe.  It is a very relaxing atmosphere.  Next, you have Edgar the phenomenal server who was patient and totally knowledgeable....did I say patient??  Next was the food, and it didn't disappoint.  We started with the Polenta Fries to share as an appetizer.  I recommend if you share this there is enough for 3-4 people.  There was only two of us.  Then the entree's....I had the Rojas Tacos and hubby had the Street Tacos.  Both were amazingly brilliant tasty pieces of culinary art.  But wait, if you order right the Ginzo Knives right now...sorry....if you order dessert after eating all that be prepared for death by dessert.  We had the ice cream with baklava.  There was nuts and seasonings in a wondrous concoction that definitely made us want more and more and more.  #toodiefor #notonthediet #foodorgasm #lookatthepicsiposted.  The food here made our trip so worthwhile as if Santa Barbara isn't special all on it's own.",5 star rating,Jeffrey C.

2/17/2018,"San Francisco, CA","We had no intention of going to Santa Barbara however, took a little detour to try this place out due to the great reviews.We get there around 4 pm, a couple tables were full but it definitely was not busy with plenty of empty tables. We were told to wait for about 10 minutes before they could seat us. We were confused since there were plenty of tables available, about 5 minutes later a couple walks in and they were told to wait 10 minutes as well, they had the same confused look on their face. Not sure if this is an inside locals joke because seems like shortly after a couple locals walked in and they were told to wait 10 minutes and they laughed it off and proceeded to seat themselves.Hmmm on to the food. We got the jackfruit tacos & picadillo empanadas, pictured below. The empanadas were delicious & very flavorful. Didn't feel the same about the jackfruit tacos, felt like there was something lacking. We also got juice, was expecting freshly squeezed juice but it comes in a bottle which you can return for $2 off your bill. I would've have opted for a smoothie had I known it wasn't freshly squeezed. Our waitress was extremely sweet, kudos to her. The ambiance was nice & the restaurant is very clean. Owning a vegan restaurant is no easy feat, I appreciate the creativity & effort.",4 star rating,AK K.

7/14/2017,"Los Altos, CA","Santa Barbara has really improved their healthy food options.  This has never been a place that is known to have very good restaurants, in fact they come and go faster than any other city I have been to.  But with Mesa Verde I think they are here to stay for a while.  What's cool about this place is it's casual but also pretty gourmet at the same time.  It's in a part of SB that is where there are some cool local beaches like 1000 steps and Mesa Lane steps, and there are not many tourists which is nice.  The inside is very modern with wonderful decor of wood on the walls and ceilings and rustic tables and chairs that give it a farm to table feel.   There is also a nice patio to sit outside to enjoy the beautiful Santa Barbara weather. The menu is a dream for vegans but it's also a place that meat eaters would enjoy as there are lots of dishes to choose from from salads to tacos, risottos, pastas, pizzas, even a couple of middle eastern dishes.  The only dish I saw that had dairy was the lasagna and I guess it's a big hit with customers.  I've been here 3 times and I've ordered different things and I have been very happy with everything I've tried.    The dishes are also very good to split as they are quite large.  For example last time I was here my dining companion and I split a vegan caesar salad and the rajas tacos.  It's the perfect amount of food for most people.The caesar salad was probably the best caesar I've ever had.  The lettuce was so fresh and the olives they put on the salad were so good and complemented  the dish.  They also sprinkled dried olives which was amazing.  I'm not even an olive lover and I loved this dish.  They sprinkled little borage flowers on top which made it visually beautiful.  5 star material.The tacos come on a slab and they are visually beautiful and giant.  They came with cacao black beans and smoked veggies, cheese and avocado and radish.  They are pretty hard to eat as they are so packed with goodies you can't really pick them up and eat with your hands.  Best is to use the old knife and fork.Desserts here are also delicious.  The baklava is delicious and I look forward to try other items next time I hit this place up.  There is also a decent drink menu of juices and elixirs.  I've never tried as I have always gone with the local beer on tap.  They also have a good selection of wines, some of which are local.  Overall you gotta check this place out.",5 star rating,Ron K.
8/20/2019,"Davis, CA","I will remember my experience here forever. That sounds super cheesy, but it's true. It's rare that I dine at a restaurant that has amazing food, service and at an amazing price. I was dining alone and traveling so couldn't have leftovers, but I reallllly wanted to try the brussel sprouts appetizer. So I asked if they could prepare a smaller portion for me. At first the server said they could not, but then returned with a smaller portion of the dish for me (and it was at no charge!). On top of this, the server described the meals on the menu in detail, which was a huge help because I had no clue what to order. I chose the socca for my main course. That and the fried brussel sprouts were so filling and delicious! I will be stopping by when I'm back in the area.",5 star rating,Kris J.
12/26/2018,"Fremont, CA","You really can't go wrong with this place. The kombucha is refreshing, the grilled cheese sandwiches are gargantuan. The empanadas are crispy, and the street tacos are a major hit. Don't forget to try the baklava they're simply out of this world.",5 star rating,Suhas Y.
8/25/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","This is a great vegan restaurant coming from a non-vegan! I always enjoy vegan food and sometimes finding places that have good options and good ingredients can be difficult. But the protein options are great here. The Vegan Pizza is a must - cashew cheese - to die for. Also the macro bowl is good. The beet salad is DELICIOUS with the macadamia yogurt. Honestly the yogurt tasted like it had dairy products in it, it was so good and creamy. We ordered these three plates to share between three people and it was more than enough food. They are generous with their portions.The ambiance is also a plus.",5 star rating,Gia T.
8/31/2018,"Santee, CA",We got the mushroom burger and the vegan lasagna. Both were pretty good. My favorite was the lasagna. The tomatoes on the burger were extraordinary. It was plenty of food. They offer a kids pizza which is cool but my picky kids wouldn't even eat that. Kids these days... it was a really cool menu in my opinion. more of a foodie type spot than a place you take your family though.,4 star rating,Andrew G.
7/19/2018,"Solvang, CA","Swooped in on a hunch... I got the hummus, and the empanadas based on a recommendation from my server.  I am not a cilantro fan, and I didn't look hard enough at the menu, when I ordered the empanadas, but I politely told my server about my weird disorder (cilantro tastes like dirty soap water to me, just soap in general really.) And he took it back, they made a new one without cilantro.  No issues, which was awesome! The hummus was great not too thick, not too creamy, just right... I'm updating my review, one because I remembered more things and two the owner on my way out, asked me if I liked Kombucha? I said YES!! He asked if I wanted some for my trip home? YES, THANK YOU! I drove away, and at my next stop, took a sip of this ""Whaleburg"" Guava Kombucha and OMFG! It was absolutely AMAZING!!! (My husband loves the multi-green from GTs, ugh gag me with a spoon!!! ) But this, I'd never had before... My taste buds came alive, my body instantly 'woke up,' I imagine this is what Popeye the sailor feels like after eating his spinach.  Besides the amazing food, I would come back for this Kombucha again and again!!! Thank you for being in business, and now that more people are accepting the benefits of plant based eating, I am grateful you exist.  Please continue to thrive!!! I will be back, great service, everyone welcomed me with a smile and friendly welcomes... wonderful service!",5 star rating,Courtney T.
4/7/2018,"San Dimas, CA",My husband and I came to Santa Barbara for business and found this amazing Vegan Restaurant. We shared the Street Tacos  and each of us had one of their lasagnas. Everything was delicious. The owner visited our table at the end to make sure that we enjoyed our meal and gave us 2 deserts to try. My husband has never liked baklava but he loved this one.

5/26/2019,"San Jose, CA","Excited to see more vegan spots opening up along the coast, we came here on the Sunday before Memorial Day at noon. The parking lot is between a 711 and a gas station, so don't expect to ever find a spot here - just go around the corner. The restaurant is small but clean. No dust on shelves or windowsills. This is an after yoga spot, full of aging hippies in Lululemon. Of course the servers were all in tights too, so maybe it's just a Santa Barbara thing. Now, going by the professional-looking photos, I was worried this place would be stuffy and overpriced, but it is quite casual yet offers high-class eats. You'll spend about $15 per plate here. The servers, btw, are quite young. Whether that contributed to our ill-timed meal or if the brunch ""crowd"" did, we don't know, but we do agree that the servers were nice. We were greeted immediately and were able to be seated without wait or reservation. We got water right away (without ordering it), but didn't have a server come over for more than 4 minutes even though we were right next to the server station. (The table seated next to us had the exact experience, so maybe this is customary here.)When our server came by to get our drink order, we went ahead and ordered our meals since we'd already decided. Wine/beer to drink, we asked to split a Caesar salad, one order of empanadas, and the Impossible burrito. We asked to make everything vegan. The lunch menu doesn't offer any side dishes or small salads, which it why we asked to split the Caesar. We got the empanadas first and had eaten half of it before getting the salad (on one plate instead of split on two plates - perhaps we should have been clear). The two-top table where we were seated was small so by the time the burrito came we were at full capacity for plates and knocking plates together. A couple of plates were chipped, giving a more homey feel to the presentation of eat dish. Seriously, the food was colorful layers of textures and salty/sweetness like something off Chefs Table. The empanadas had a homemade dough that soaked up the adobo sauce and black beans. This lended nicely to the sharp pickled cabbage on top and chewy, spicy jackfruit. You may think this portion would be too small at first glance, but I'm telling you it will fill you up! The Caesar salad had thick chunks of peppercorn and avocado and was dressed nicely and topped with homemade croutons. It's good, but not new. The showstopper was the Impossible Burrito. The size of your forearm, don't expect to finish this in one seating unless you're splitting it with someone. The Impossible burger pairs nicely with the fruit and generous sauce. Finally, we finished the meal with strawberry cheesecake and baklava with ice cream and both ordered espresso. The strawberry cheesecake was really sliced strawberries on a blueberry flavored cheesecake. Not sure if we got switched to blueberry or if this is just how their strawberry cheesecake is defined, but it was pretty good. It was served with a cashew cream that's neither cold, as the ice cream shaped scope would have you believe, nor creamy. At first taste, you get a sense of cookie dough, but it doesn't seem to ""go"" with the creamy blueberry of the cheesecake. Eating it with the sliced strawberries though was pleasant but we did not finish this dish. The true winner was the baklava and ice cream. Although not super thin layers of classic baklava, this obviously homemade with love dessert is full of pistachios and sweet vinegary sticky syrup that finishes the vanilla ice cream splendidly. The espresso was just ok but cut the sweetness like you want at the end of a feast.All in all we spent about $120 for two people (including tip) and were able to fill our bellies nicely. Our neighbors say they change their menu every few months, and that they've turned the whole menu vegan, so I guess you don't have to specify vegan anymore. Our neighbors also had their plates come out at separate times, so this is probably the norm here. Eat while it's hot!",4 star rating,Vegan C.
10/15/2017,"Santa Monica, CA","Incredible restaurant. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the food is absolutely phenomenal.

7/23/2018,"San Jose, CA","Wow, simply amazing - that's how I would sum up the food, service, and experience of Mesa Verde. From the moment my friends and I were seated we were overwhelmed by the welcoming and warm vibes of the restaurant. The waitress welcomed us by explaining how the entire menu was almost vegan, excluding two dishes. She recommended family style & ordering appetizers in order to try as many dishes as possible.For our group of 6, we ordered two appetizers and six mains. There was pizzas, tacos, hummus, Buddha bowls, lasagna, and more!! And all of them were delicious! My two vegan friends exclaimed at how this was some of the best food they had ever eaten. And I can validate their excitement for the food, it was delicious tasting as well as looking!The ambiance of the restaurant is casual yet could also be a lovely date night. We saw families, couples, and friends enjoying their meals. The prices were average for a dinner and dessert looked amazing (but we were too stuffed to try any).Would 100% recommend for anyone - vegan, vegetarian, or meat-eater!",5 star rating,Natalie R.
7/8/2015,"Pasadena, CA","This place is one of the most eye-catching vegan restaurant! (they serve some other vegetarian food, not 100% vegan, but a lot of vegan choices) Their dishes are VERY VERY creative. They serve seasonal menu, the dishes are very pretty, and the service is very warm. Really if their is any downside, it is that their menu is big, but I can't fit them all in my stomach!! We had the street tacos, empanadas, and a macro bowls. Unless a lot of vegan restaurants, the dishes taste different. They are not like a bowl of these vegetables and with different sauces. Here they all look and taste differently. The street tacos were my favorite. Many layers of flavor and texture, one is quite big and can be filling. The grilled veggies in the macro bowl was also quite flavorful, even without the sauce. In end, Three dishes were quite a lot for two people, as their portion was not on the small side. But we had to have dessert as they looked so appetizing! We had the candied fig and vanilla cream. The almond cake came along with the dish was not that attractive, I didn't taste any almond, but only like a dry chocolate cake. but the ice cream served with the fig was quite a nice combo. I think I will have to come back and try more of their dishes! Too bad I don't live close by! Wish we had something similar in LA!",5 star rating,Priscilla Z.
6/17/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","We came in for lunch due to high marks on Yelp and had high expectations. The restaurant was fairly empty at a late lunch hour yet service was remarkably slow at first that even another couple had to get up to hail service. Drinks were served in open glass jars, which I am no fan of. When I asked for a different type of glass, I was told that there is only jars, either small or large. C'est la vie.We ordered a variety of dishes: hummus, Caesar salad, deconstructed BLT with veggie patty and tempeh bacon, and something on the menu called ""Morroccon Cous Cous"".Overall, the food was tasty, but many dishes tasted the same. What surprised us the most was the Moroccon (should be ""Moroccan"") Cous Cous. I've had authentic vegan Cous Cous before. Aside for the misspelling on the menu, this dish not only fell far from the tree, the Cous Cous was Israeli Cous cous, which is a type of pasta, that when done properly is a delicious dish. Real Cous Cous is made of semolina flour. For vegan Cous Cous, a good substitute to semolina flour would have been quinoa. But beyond that, the flavor of the broth was more like an Italian tomato soup with oregano. It had absolutely no flavor, no spices that are used when making real Cous Cous (which is made with cumin and turmeric to give the Cous Cous it wonderful deep flavor). Oddly, the dish was topped with sliced avocado. This dish was not bad, but it should be renamed as to not confuse the consumer.Overall, not a bad restaurant. I would say a 3.5 out 5 Stars. Regretfully, I don't anticipate coming back.",3 star rating,Eyal D.

We were seated quickly by a nice and friendly host. We ordered smoothies and a rose water and our very nice waiter brought them to us quickly. Then we ordered an empanada and grilled cheese, and it was to DIE FOR! So so tasty! We loved our experience at Mesa Verde and we will be back! :-)",5 star rating,Lynn F.

7/13/2018,"Laguna Beach, CA",What an amazing gem! It was a hot day but I ordered one of the herbal infused teas and put it over ice. Everything on the menu sounded superb so Alex my sweet server helped me decide between the vegan grilled cheese and the tacos. The Rojas tacos are piled high with healthy delicious grilled veggies that made me full after just one taco. If you have room save it for the baklava paired with a scoop of ice cream and some raspberry drizzle that will blow your mind. Don't leave without getting a smile from Chenti and a hug from Jamall.,5 star rating,Jen C.
8/3/2018,"Santa Barbara Downtown, Santa Barbara, CA","Someone about a year ago told me that I should go here since I'm a vegetarian and I haven't gotten the chance to go until recently. I went with my parents (who are not vegeterians) for lunch. The restaurant is aesthetically gorgeous and the waitress we had serving us was super nice (she even gave us desert - which was delicious and surprisingly vegan!). However, I can't give it a five star because of the food itself - which makes me sad considering this is catered to vegeterians.I ordered the mushroom burger and I was not impressed. I felt like they were trying way too hard to become a meat burger, which it wasn't. It tasted so bland, in fact, by the end of it, I was craving an actual beef burger, which I had not craved for in months. That's how flavorless I felt like the burger is. I heard about the other dishes though and I hope, if I get the chance to go again (since this restaurant is pricy) and try something else, I can update this review and have it be the 4.5 restaurant that it is currently.",3 star rating,Maribel B.
7/24/2018,"Culver City, CA","I am a semi-regular guest of yours who always brings in someone from out of town to Mesa Verde, meaning I don't go as often as I'd like to - I also work in the restaurant business and time is just super scarce - but I've always been super proud of your menu, presentation, and how you showcase vegan dishes and make them so appealing - and delicious. Two Saturdays ago though, I brought my boyfriend and twin sister from LA at 8:15pm for dinner. I understand you close at 9pm, and as a server myself, I wouldn't appreciate if someone came in at 8:45, or at 9pm; but at 8:15, considering that we were aware of it and tried to speed up ordering and the whole process, I would expect just a little less rush.We got all of the appetizers and entrees at once, and once I brought that to the hostess's attention, she simply explained that ""at this time this is what we do"". Nothing came out of that, the server tried to clear our plates numerous times (we were not the last table in the restaurant) and at the end we gave up and asked that part of our entree be wrapped up to-go. As we walked out, the owner asked simply if ""the food was ok"", which I honestly was so upset about that I didn't even respond. I really wished that upon finding out that something was going on at a table, he were willing to investigate and approached the table, as he recognizes us as guests every time we walk in while we were still at the table...The young lady who served us this time is apparently new and I suspect she's not vegan or not a conscientious server, as I remember last time we ate there about a month ago and asked about specific items as suggestions, she replied with ""the chlorella risotto? Well, that's very, VERY green. The cashew cheese grilled cheese sandwich? Well, it's rich, just VERY rich."" I almost felt like she is inexperienced or simply doesn't know how to steer a guest. As a word of advice as an experienced server, we WANT to be steered, and amused, otherwise we could just make food at home.I understand being busy, or ready to go home, and as a professional I navigate that all the time - I have had guests come in literally last minute and spending 90 minutes+ at the restaurant, and some of those times I had the best table of the whole night with that experience alone. I do plan on returning, but I just wanted to bring that out to your attention. Because service does go beyond food. Thank you.",2 star rating,Giselle S.

This place is near Stearns Wharf so location was convenient though parking was pretty tough. I am KICKING myself y'all for not taking a photo of the empanadas we had. I think about those vegan empanadas ALL THE FREAKING TIME. All the flavors don't necessarily sound to me like they go together but it was an insane combo of flavors that I can't even describe. I had a really good lasagna thing I did get a photo of and a nice little hot tea. The place had a very cute and rustic vibe, very clean place. The server was friendly and sweet though I cannot remember her name unfortunately as this was over a month ago.

1/21/2019,"Castro Valley, CA","I'm super late in writing this but I absolutely LOVE this place. Even if you're not vegan they have amazingly tasty and fresh dishes so it's super worth it. I went there a few years ago for the first time back in March of 2016 for my spring break and we loved it so much we ate there for lunch every day that we were there for the rest of our trip! Back then I got their BLTA, Patatas Bravas Tacos, and the Hades smoothie (more like a shake really). I highly recommend all of those.This most recent time, back on December 18, 2019, my boyfriend and I drove the two and a half hours to Santa Barbara from his place and planned our trip around making it there for lunch on a road trip. Trust me, it's that good! I got the BLTA and Hades again and he got the Patatas Bravas Tacos and the Calypso smoothie. We were given complimentary baklava at the end of our meal also since our server learned about my love and loyalty to this restaurant. I can't remember his name, I'm so sorry, but he was absolutely great: kind, amiable, and attentive, really great guy. (If his boss is reading this, we sat outside around 12pm on December 18, 2019-he's a hard worker and we really appreciated his service.)The photos I've attached are of the Calypso smoothie and tacos and a close-up of the tacos from 2016.

I visited on a Tuesday evening with a party of 7 Omni friends and family. I recommend getting a reservation, because this place can get busy! The menu had a great variety of appetizers, main dishes, pizza, and desserts. I had no idea where to start! But with recommendations from the owner and staff, we quickly jumped in to order so many items! The food came quickly and in good portion sizes. I wish I had a restaurant like this close to the Bay Area, I recommend every person try here for vegan, vegetarian and just good food. I am happy to be the 1000th review and they deserve their 5 stars!

3/26/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Boy has been working a lot. Girl has been feeling neglected. So, boy decided to take girl on romantic weekend trip up to SB. This was our first stop.First Impression: 5/5For the past few months we've been trying to eat plant-based during the week, so when we found Mesa Verde on Yelp & read all the amazing reviews, we put this on the top of our bookmarked list. Upon arrival, who I assume was the owner greeted me with a warm smile. He asked where I was visiting from (was it that obvious I wasn't from there?) and asked how I had heard about them. I mentioned our recent weekday plant-based story, mentioned Yelp, and was seated shortly after, feeling very welcomed.Ambiance: 5/5The restaurant itself is very casual and cute. Indoor and outdoor seating with a very bright and open floor plan. We decided to sit outside, although it was a bit chilly.Food: 3/5The lunch menu was pretty short and sweet. Light lunch fares with a couple mediterranean dishes. In my opinion, the mediterranean-inspired dishes were the winners here. Here's what we ordered:Kombucha: 5/5They have fresh brewed seasonal kombucha here, which I'm always down for. The waiter thought the flavor was ginger-lime, but wasn't sure...definitely wasn't ginger-lime. I think it was blood orange? Couldn't quite tell, but it had a very pretty orange-pink-ish hue. Maybe guava? Very lightly flavored, perfectly fizzy, and not too sweet. Big fan here.Grilled Flatbread w/ Hummus: 4/5The flatbread itself came warm and seasoned with some salty, yet flavorful herbs. The hummus was creamy and light. It was sprinkled with some slivered olives (we both aren't fans of olives, but they didn't detract from the flavor). Solid hummus starter. We ended up eating most of this & taking the rest home.Grilled Cheese: 2/5I'm a big grilled cheese fan...almost always. Sadly, this was not a winner. The sandwich came with a cashew cheese spread, poblano pepper, and some greens inside of grilled sourdough bread. The bread was pretty good...light and fluffy, lightly grilled. Everything on the inside was just kind of meh, to be honest. Coming from a former vegan, the 'cheese' could have been better. It ended up tasting more like faux cream cheese than what you'd expect in a grilled cheese sandwich. The poblano and other greens included in the sandwich all kind of blended flavors and tasted kind of like flavorless mush. I wish the flavors were more distinct and there was more of a differentiation in textures -- maybe a little crunch or spice? I was initially really excited to try this dish, but it fell short.Rajas Tacos: 2/5This dish was absolutely stunning. Aesthetically. It was beautiful -- easily could have been a dish out of Chef's Table. The colors were vibrant and beautiful -- perfectly plated, really. The flavors, however, were just okay. Similar to the Grilled Cheese dish, I wish each element of the tacos were more distinct. It seemed like all of the veggies in the tacos were sautéed together and had the same texture & flavors. Even the peppers weren't really discernible from the rest of the vegetables. The description mentioned butternut nacho cheese, but I didn't taste or see any on the tacos? Maybe I just couldn't tell. I usually LOVE radishes, especially yellow radishes. They're my favorite. When pickled right, they have the sweetest, most scrumptious flavor. These, however, didn't really have  much flavor. Disappointing, because I really wanted to love this dish. It really is a gorgeous dish, so I hate to leave a subpar review, but the flavors just weren't there. Also...they don't have hot sauce... at all...so that was a bummer.+ Baklava & Soy Ice Cream: 5/5This dish was compliments of the chef! This was probably one of my favorite dishes, actually! I'm a HUGE fan of baklava and this one was flavored with agave instead of honey. The puff pastry was perfectly baked and delicate. The pistachio crumble added beautiful color and texture. The soy ice cream had a bit of a tart bite to it, but it complemented the sweet baklava well. 10/10 would get this again.I must note that the service was impeccable. Everyone was incredibly friendly (and seemed to be genuinely so). The restaurant was cozy and inviting and the dishes that were good were very good. Maybe we ordered the wrong things for our main courses? [shrug]Overall, I'd say that I've had better plant-based dishes from restaurants up here in LA, but because of the excellent service and lovely ambiance, I'd definitely give this place another try next time I'm in town!",3 star rating,Lilli I.

We had the polenta fries and Brussels to start - both were AMAZING! I love Brussels sprouts and these didn't disappoint,The service is great and so is the atmosphere (causal but still has a high end/trendy feel). We brought champagne as gifts and there was only a $15 corkage fee (which is pretty cheap for the area) to open it.Since our party was celebrating the owner came over and gave us an amazing gluten free + dairy free dessert.

8/12/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","Santa Barbara is shockingly lacking in plant-based restaurants, so Mesa Verde is much needed and appreciated and I have eaten here many times.However, I would eat here more if the food was better.  The only items really worth having are the taco platters. I think this restaurant tries too hard to be fancy, but would do better to focus on simple, delicious plant-based flavors. When I first tried this restaurant I wasn't a vegan yet, and I didn't like it at all, but now that I'm vegan, my palate has changed and I like it a lot more.It's also a bit pricey, but I'm assuming partly because plant-based foods are generally pricier (not subsidized).This place is definitely worth giving a try, and supporting. There aren't many options for vegans in Santa Barbara.",4 star rating,Beth P.

4/30/2019,"San Francisco, CA","OK, we came here last year, loved the food and were determined to return again on our next visit. Our experience this time, Sunday night, was lukewarm due to the waitress we had, not because of the food. Maybe she was having a bad day or week. We don't know, but she wasn't very friendly and was actually condescending. Her energy kinda ruined the meal.Fast forward to Monday night (last night) and the place was full of great energy, Fatima took our order and was super friendly and helpful. Monday we had gluten free pizza that was good. Sunday we had Epanada's which had lots of flavor, spicy beans.

I do remember thinking, well, I am clearly eating vegan food. I have had many vegan meals where you are just eating food. In this case, it was notably ""vegan food"". The cheesecake was 14$ (?!) and seriously mediocre. However, did not give me indigestion, which is a plus. The reason I bumped this to 2 stars and the reason I will not go back is that my dinner companion had 2 small well behaved Aussies. They were not able to provide the dogs with water, and the waitress appeared as though she genuinely did not like us despite going through the motions. Perhaps it was the dogs?

It's clean, the staff is great, and the owners are extremely genuine and nice. They made us feel like family! The food... INSANE. I could eat here all day every day and never get sick of it. I got the Gluten Free pizza that had brussel sprouts, tempeh bacon, and amazing cashew cheese. Finding gluten free pizza that actually tastes good seemed like an impossible task before coming to Mesa Verde. For dessert I highly recommend the baklava (not gluten free) but definitely worth it for those who can stomach a tiny bit of gluten! I can't wait until they expand across the country. I can't express enough how amazing their food is. If you're in Santa Barbara, screw everywhere else and GO HERE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

11/6/2016,"Torrance, CA","My friend and I came here after seeing all of the positive Yelp reviews and boy were you guys right! We shared a macro bowl. As a vegetarian I know what well cooked tofu tastes like & this place knows too. For dessert we tried pistachio baklava and one bite had me grinning. Get this and don't brush aside the tiny little purple flowers - they add such an interesting taste to traditional baklava!  The staff were so nice but the owner (manager?) really took the cake - brought it too. After talking to us, he insisted we try the pumpkin cheesecake & brought it to our table. It was overall an excellent experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant",5 star rating,Charlie G.

The jackfruit combination with beans, kale and cabbage gave it such great flavor!! We also ordered the Pomodoro flatbread pizza and the mozzarella was tasteful! The staff was helpful and gave great recommendations for food.

1/10/2018,"San Jose, CA","So I got stuck in the area due to the weather (mud slides) found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.   It's a little hard to find so keep your eyes peeled.  It's super nice on the inside, very clean all wooden details and it smells delicious.  The gal working (Hilary) greeted me right away.  Based on reviews I ordered the Artemis tea and the mushroom burger.  The burger came out first and it was beautifully presented.  The bread was fresh and fluffy and it smelled amazing.   The mushroom patty is very good, it's soft not seedy or grainy.  The flavors are great. Just an amazing balance with the thick heirloom tomato, the mushroom patty and the greens in there.  The side salad was also delicious, everything was very fresh  and beautiful.  Whomever is in the kitchen must love their job. The radish slices were evenly placed on top of the greens... things like that make me very happy. On to the tea! It smells like roses, starts off with light raspberry notes then it transitions into hibiscus with a little sour ish finish... they provide honey but I did not use it.  Anyway, the tea has a great clean finish.  I like it so much I ordered my dinner to go.  The gal working recommended the street tacos.  I'm saving those for dinner but I had to take a bite and OMG!! The red sauce on top is sooo good and a little spicy... they are beautifully presented.  I'm very excited for my dinner tonight.   If you are in the area do yourself a favor and stop in!!! You will love it.  This is one of the best places I've tried... along with Sage in LA (Culver City) and Seabirds kitchen in OC (costa mesa).Spent some time talking to Hilary and she's a great gal!! She and whomever the chef was need to get paid more.  They are amazing. With those three places vegan for life!!!",5 star rating,MAYRA A.

We ended up getting the street tacos which contained jackfruit ""chorizo"", cacao black bean, blueberry salsa, jalapeño slaw, caramelized onion, heirloom tomato, and sumac.

I finally had the opportunity to go there last week, and it was actually quite fantastic. I ordered the avocado bowl, and it was just so beautiful. It was really colorful and you could tell that the ingredients were just really fresh. All the ingredients really complimented each other, and I just felt so full and satisfied after. My friend got the falafel, and It was pretty freakin good too! The waiters were very accommodating and attentive to us too. Overall, just a very pleasant place.

I mean, gluttony beyond comprehension!Let's get to it.I'm extremely happy to have found this restaurant because I dreaded my dining options when I visited SB.  Fortunately, yelp landed me right where I needed to be on that blessed 91degree Tuesday afternoon.I truly wish I was hungrier, cause the sandwich a looked amazing.  Nonetheless, I was tempted by the beautifully plated hummus and yummy grilled flatbread.  The textures were terrific and I actually went at it with a fork once I finished the bread... trap, that good!Now, the main course was the Caesar Salad which I requested they add avocado to, ( naturally ). Splendid! The sourdough croutons and dressing really set this dish off.  Wait......... In comes this restauranteur and serves me a fresh juice sample. So refreshing, and generous. I continue to go to town on this meal and the same gent asks me where I'm from, "" Up here on business from L.A."" I replied.  ""Ah! "" He exclaims.. "" I'll have you try our vegan desert, it's like nothing you've had in .LA.""Hmmmm-The nerve of this guy to make such a claim!

9/3/2016,"San Diego, CA","Tldr ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. :)This review is a little overdue. We went way back in july. We ordered Moroccan Tagine Street Taco with cacao black beanPolenta FriesSmoothie - Jupiter made with   dates, hemp seeds, cinnamon, bananas, raw honey, sun potion anandamideBlack tea ( kalis chai) served with almond milk and raw honey.  The chef knows how to cook vegetarian food using real vegetables and make them tasty instead of using meat substitutes like soy chunks or tempeh or tofu.He creates really good flavor profiles like jackfruit chorizo with blueberry salsa. Even in desserts he combines spices in very creative way that actually works. Like the Baklawa with sumac and strawberry cheesecake with basil; spices and herbs that you will typically not associate with desserts. Both the drinks were also awesome. The raw honey with Kalis chai was sooo good. And my wife loved the dates smoothie. Best part of going into this restaurant was being able to order anything off of the menu knowing its going to be a superb vegetarian dish. This place is not just for vegans / vegetarians. I am very sure that even meat lovers who typically assume vegetarian fare consists of bland salad will be surprised by how good veg food actually tastes. We sat in the patio which allows dogs! :) The owner was very friendly and ensured we received good service and personally checked on us a couple of times. He offered us dessert on the house. But we went ahead and ordered the Baklawa and paid for it. When he came to know of that he got us another dessert, strawberry cheesecake and put that on the house. :) All the dishes were served very beautifully on wooden boards and garnished with edible flowers. :) The food was sooo good we only got pictures of the desserts!!We will definitely visit every time we are in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Shreejay N.

Not even that I didn't get what I actually order the long blonde hair server decided not to put my order (my empanadas) because he thought it was too much food for me.

6/23/2019,"San Luis Obispo, CA","We used to love this place . All house made food with pure ingredients. I ate here every time I came to SB. All of the food has canola oil in it  now . Canola oil is  cheap,  rancid , and genetically modified. They used to cook with olive and grapeseed oils which are healthy fats that are not rancid or genetically modified I can never return .Ok . We just finished a delicious lunch . Apparently ""the chef misunderstood my question "" our server stated after my DIL was almost finished with her lunch . Originally our server told me that I could not eat anything on the menu as it was ""all prepared with canola oil "". So I only ordered  the CA Salad , my fav .3/4 of the way through our meal a gentleman came to our table and stated that canola oil is only used in the fryer .The rest of the food is prepared with a blend of olive/grapeseed  oil . I ordered the Rajas Tacos with a side of cashew cheese and the herbal coffee with their homemade almond milk . Delicious as always , and yes we will return.This problem could have been avoided if the staff was properly educated on the ingredients they are serving.

I ordered the beet salad. Very refreshing and light. On the sweeter side if that's your taste (definitely mine). We also got some soy ice cream with baklava and saffron cheesecake. Normally I'm not a fan of baklava but this one will not disappoint. It's not too sweet. Made with agave rather than the typical syrup.

We ordered Rajas tacos & brussel sprouts (not for me ;)) to go. Sure enough the tacos were fantastic and filling. The perfect meal to end a long tiring day. I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts in any form. I wasn't going to be converted this time either. When the wife offered them and said they were good, I scorned but tried them. What happened next has still left me reeling.... Hands down the best brussel sprouts I had had. Maybe it was the tiredness, I dug in for another mouthful and kept digging in until we ended up sharing that portion. We had to go back for another fix...Day-2: Macro bowl and Pomodoro flatbread. Fresh healthy bowl of food in the Macro bowl, yet wonderfully tasteful! The Pomodoro flatbread was the right amount of grease and tomatoes! Finished the meal off with a chocolate cake that was light and delicious. I would definitely recommend Mesa Verde, you will not be disappointed. And then go back again :)",5 star rating,Amogh M.

Everything we tried was superb and so tasty, including the mushroom risotto, polenta fries, both lasagnas, grilled cheese, ceasar salad, sweet potato and broccolini, chicory coffee, kombucha and baklava.My husband's favorite was the risotto and mine was probably the grilled cheese and lasagna although everything was truly outstanding. My husband loves baklava but never orders it because it's usually too sweet -- this one was perfect, bursting with flavor on lemon ice cream.Loved the mix of flavors and textures -- beats any vegan restaurant I've tried in LA.

Then the street tacos, peach salad, and polenta fries. Jackfruit is such a great meat sub! Everything was fresh and really yummy. My friend didn't care for the peach salad, so if you aren't a fan of vegan food to begin with, you might not love that dish.

It's definitely the best place in SB if you're a vegan or vegetarian since it's nice to be able to pick ANYTHING off the menu. No needing to substitute this or leave out that.  Overall it was a great experience - the service was friendly and the food was good, what more could you ask for? As expected from all the photos I've seen, when the food came out, it was beautifully plated! We ordered the Picadillo Empanadas and Smoked Pulled Mushroom to share. The empanadas were delicious although I couldn't really distinguish what the ingredients inside were (all I know is that chimichurri on top was spectacular). For the smoked pulled mushroom, I asked for it to be on tortillas (shout out to Danah for mentioning that, cause it's a great idea!). The tortillas tasted homemade and the mushroom/jackfruit mixture was the closest thing to carne asada I've had since becoming a pescetarian. I mean they're definitely not carne asada tacos, but with that excellent texture and fantastic seasoning, I'll take what I can get! I can't wait to return and try all the other stuff on their menu that people have raved about - I'm coming for you baklava.",4 star rating,Veronika L.

7/13/2016,"Pico Union, Los Angeles, CA","This place! Fantastic vegan and gluten free options. I enjoyed lunch at Mesa Verde recently and I was pleasantly surprised by the menu mostly because I had so many options. Being gluten free, plant based can be tough when one is trying to fine-dine. Not at Mesa Verde. I ordered the favored street tacos which featured jackfruit. I killed two (stuffed)birds with that choice people! I've been hoping and plotting to try jackfruit tacos. Boom! Done! Bucket list item compete. Moving on to leaving this review. I enjoyed being able to order practically anything from the menu. I felt all warm and fuzzy inside and just as I thought things couldn't get better, Jamal (I think that's his name, pardon me if I'm incorrect) offered me free desert. Excuse me, free, raw, vegan, gluten free, strawberry cheesecake. No lie, it was....man...Go try it and find out for yourself. Xoxo",5 star rating,Chrissie L.

6/17/2016,"Ventura, CA","I'm giving this place a five star rating, not for the food (because I have yet to try it - & I will!) but for the customer service from Jamal & Nick. Monday afternoon I was extremely nauseous and just needed to find somewhere close to me that offered good ginger tea. I ran into this place barely able to contain my stomach (TMI, I know) seeking some tea. Jamal greeted me w/ a bright ""HEL-LOOO!"" He saw my face and immediately offered the tea on the house. Nick offered I sit outside and while I was sitting, he cleared everything out the way so I can be more comfortable. The two of them made my day and checked on me every few minutes to see if I needed anything and if there was anything they could do to help. That day was extremely emotional for me as well because of some personal issues but Jamal & Nick seriously brightened my day. I'm actually here for the second time, sitting inside of this beautiful restaurant writing the review. They've gained a customer for sure.",5 star rating,Gianna D.

Loved my umami burger and the sweet owner whose name I sadly did not get sent us home with a box of vegan baklava which was to die for. SMART man! UPDATEWe had to return again before leaving SB and were not disappointed. Not only do they have fabulous food, but the hospitality and personal touches really set them apart. Jamal, the owner, clearly loves what he does. It seems they are very accommodating if you have a special request, as well.I will add that there is a lot of room, inside and out, and easy parking. The whole place is surrounded by beautiful colorful flowers; it really feels like you're in a friend's garden.",5 star rating,Olga G.
12/19/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","For vegan food, this was great! After a weekend of eating, my friend and I wanted something veg healthy, and dragged my grizzly manbear husband along. First of all the Hades smoothie was BOMB, and they had the ginger sassafras kombucha on tap that night which was amazing. We started with the tacos (patatas and the one below that on the menu) which were both delicious and filling in themselves. Grizzly manbear husband got the pomodoro pizza and said it was good, not bad, but not enough cheese. I got the sausage and onion pizza which was delicious, I loved dipping it into the ricotta. My friend got the empanadas and ate everything except the last 2 bites, we were all so full. I was determined to try desert, we got the baklava which was SOO good. I actually ate my baklava at home a few days later, due to fullness, and it was still amazing. The soy ice cream with pomegranate syrup and sumac was to die for. We rolled ourselves out, and even the grizzly manbear husband didn't complain too heavily. My friend had a tougher time finding compliant foods because she's allergic to most nuts, but  you just have to ask them and let them know you're allergic to stuff. She knows her body isn't very vegan compliant.",4 star rating,Brianna V.

Is the restaurant under new ownership? I used to pick up once a week and dine in at least once a week as well. Why would you take the Milken Sweet Potato and Broccolini off the menu?!! Why change up the Macrobowl?! I used to consider this my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara and recommend it to all my friends. I can't do that anymore.

2/11/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","It's all good. So good.We decided to try Mesa Verde for dinner after a walk on the beach. The first thing we noticed was a spacious and crisp decor...plus ample parking. But we didn't go there for the parking, right?First of all, every server stopped by our table and greeted us. Very friendly and pleasant.  A good start. The coffee was excellent. Always nice. On to my entrée...Polenta fries with smoked beans and roasted veggies. Sounded simple. But what I got was amazing. Plated beautifully on a wooden board; the flavors and texture were just perfect. Every flavor melded in my mouth. Dessert was a triumph, a home made baklava, with just a hint of pomegranate, served with vegan ice cream.We could tell that the chef really cared about what came to our table, each item was perfect. The level of service remained excellent throughout the meal. And finally, the owner Jamal stopped by our table and greeted us as if we were old friends. All these rave reviews are for real. Take a walk on the beach... then stop by Mesa Verde. You'll find a perfect end to your perfect day.",5 star rating,Francesca S.

The staff always greets you with a smile and makes you feel so welcome!But back to the food: everything we have ever had has been outstanding. This is my top 3 restaurants as a vegan.

The hummus is so fresh and every plate is like a little work of art, I always have to snapchat the meals here haha :)For dinner you really can't go wrong and I HIGHLY recommend not skipping dessert here, trust me. all their desserts are amazing but particularly the Baklavah, with the most epic Pommegranate Molasses sauce (UM WTH YUMMM!!!) is just to die for!",5 star rating,K K.

Clean and beautiful inside, I was just hoping to the food tasted as good as it photographed. The street tacos jumped out at me reading the menu because I like jackfruit, and sure enough the tacos arrived looking too good to eat! But eat them we needed to. Shockingly, they tasted even better than they looked. Flavorful, spicy, tender, and the tortillas had that handmade fresh mouth feel (if you have had proper tortillas, you get what I mean).We also had the baklava with vanilla ice cream, which turned out to be one of the more perfect desserts I have had in ages. The baklava wasn't too sweet (my usual complaint about baklava) and I don't get how the ice cream it came with was not real dairy. Spot on!Beyond that the service was so friendly and personal but not intrusive. I am not even vegan, but I would definitely come back here again.",5 star rating,Dan K.

6/11/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Unfortunately, Mesa Verde fell from its pedestal for me after my visit to the restaurant. We came for lunch on a Wednesday and were seated immediately (note: the restaurant has parking up front). After taking a look at the menu, we decided on the Grilled Cheese, the Street Tacos, and the Picadillo Empanadas. We were sorely disappointed by the food. It was bland, the flavors were off-kilter, and the seasoning was incongruous. Something should be done to remedy at least these three dishes. That said, the staff was really kind to us and gave us dessert- Baklava- on the House. A+ for customer service even though the food wasn't amazing.",3 star rating,Sneha K.

And I struggled between the BLT on flatbread and the falafel bowl. I went with the bowl...oh. mer.gawd.  We also had a few Americanos that were amazing. While we were finishing up our meal, the owner came over and said hello and brought us out the most incredible dessert plate of VEGAN...you heard me...Vegan baklava and vanilla ice cream!! I died upon first bite and was brought back to life with the second. If more carnivores could try vegan and vegetarian cuisine like this...we'd all be plant eaters!

12/28/2015,"Canoga Park, CA","Based on a friend's recommendation, I had the chance to visit this restaurant out of curiosity. Everyone seemed to rave about it, but I was a little skeptical. First off, I'm a big meat eater, so the idea of a vegetarian restaurant was not an appetizing one to me. I started off slow, trying their empanadas. They were surprisingly flavorful, and I did not miss the meat at all. But the highlight of my night was the street tacos. Aside from the elegant presention, the unique blend of flavors has brought this meat-eater to appreciate what a good vegetarian/vegan dish is supposed to taste like.Overall, I was impressed by this places dedication to staying true to their ideals yet not sacrificing taste. I hope to come back again soon to try more of their seasonal specials.",5 star rating,Bentacular E.

We were craving tacos so my girlfriend and I ordered the Rajos Tacos and the Street Tacos.  I wasn't sure if 2 tacos would be filling but I was wrong. I barely got through my tacos and my girlfriend could only finish one. When I asked for the bill, our host offered us a complimentary dessert because we were out of town and it was our first visit here.  It wasn't just a nice gesture, it was one of the best desserts I've had and it was Vegan!

8/24/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Just had a nice dinner at Mesa Verde. I am not a vegetarian but do enjoy well prepared veggies. 3 stars on Yelp means the place was good and that's exactly how I feel. Would I go back sure, top pick for me nope. Mesa Verde does a great job creating complicated vegetarian and vegan dishes that  would be traditionally served with meat. We tried several dishes and found them to be good The plates were bean and lagoon heavy. Lots of Lentils. I would have liked to see more Farmers Market veggies.  The flavor profile was a bit flat on many dishes.  I would have preferred a little more fat in most dishes. We tried the Vegan Cheese cake and the Panacotta for desert. These were both not good. The Panacotta was made with an almond cream that was mostly tasteless. The cheese cake was made with some type of tree but as it tasted more like peanut butter then cheese cake. The price is a bit of an issue. Most dishes are quite expensive and portions are small.",3 star rating,Andreas B.

11/1/2015,"Somerville, MA","Spending a loverly Saturday in Santa Barbara, we never know exactly what we will do (though beach and Crush Cafe are always a given)  We decided to see if there was anywhere we thought dinner worthy and my husband actually found this place.  I took one look at the pictures on yelp and said ""absolutely we must go to here!""Mesa Verde did not disappoint.We ordered so much.  Starting with the grilled housemade sourdough with spanish manchego, english pea, strawberry, and black olive.  It was so beautifully displayed I almost couldn't eat it.  Just kidding, I devoured it.  It was so fresh and delicious.  The sourdough was out of this world and the strawberries gave the perfect sweetness to this sour/salty/savory dish.  All around, a very great start to the meal.Next up were the picadillo empanadas with cashew cheese, cacao black beans, chimichurri, harissa, and pickled savoy cabbage and carrots.  These were equally phenomenal as the starter.  The crisp of the empanada casing and the depth of flavor from the cacao black beans made this a fully deep flavored dish.We got a special of the day which was sweet potatoes 3 ways.  They were mashed, topped with some roasted, topped with some chips.  This was delicious of course.  The mashed were some of the best I've ever had.Last for the savory dishes we had the street taco with cacao black bean, jackfruit 'chorizo', blueberry chipotle salsa, caramelized onion, heirloom tomato, sumac, and jalapeno onion slaw.  These were solid, beautiful, and tasty.  They were, however, my least favorite of the 4 dishes.  But everything was so delicious, I'm really just being picky so I can say I had a favorite and a least favorite.  Nothing was wrong with anything that we ordered here!Now for dessert!  We had the cheesecake and the baklava.  Oh.  Em.  Gee.  Now, I am not a big fan of cheesecake, but my husband loves it. Of course this is cashew cheesecake (it's vegan) so this was a whole other story.  So creamy.  So full of flavor.  Pecan. Yellow Corn Crust. Peaches. Basil.  Need I say more?  Ok...I'll talk about the Baklava - or as they call it: Baklaca.  It is served with vanilla ice cream, pomegranate molasses, pistachio, mint, sumac, and it will make you stretch your arms back, push back you seat, and say ""wow, that was the best meal I have had in a long time.""Mesa Verde: we shall meet again.",5 star rating,Taryn B.
11/13/2017,"Santa Monica, CA",We found this place because we needed a dog friendly patio after hitting up the nearby dog beach and we were not disappointed!  Besides a spacious patio their food is on point and even meat lovers would enjoy their mushroom burger.

Better experience would have been, ""good evening, let me show you to a table, here are our specials."" I only stayed because I wanted to eat plant based foods. I had mushroom tacos, which were okay but forgettable. The tortilla was still doughy, the shishito pepper raw, but the sauce was nice.

12/2/2015,"Fullerton, CA","First I should start off with saying that I'm not vegan so the lack of cheese is sometimes hard to get over in certain dishes. I really like cashew cheese though so I can still enjoy vegan food. I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but I felt the dishes were very hit-and-miss. We started with the empanadas, which were fabulous (not to mention a good-sized appetizer).  We then tried the street tacos, macadamia nut crostini, and the risotto. The street tacos were huge!! I liked the flavor but felt like the tacos needed cheese or something else a bit creamy to make them less dry (there was salsa but not enough in terms of volume or flavor). The macadamia nut crostini was the opposite - so creamy with the macadamia nut cheese that it was hard to get the crostini down your throat. The flavors were good but there was too much cheese. The mushroom risotto was surprisingly very good. I normally don't like mushrooms or risotto (too creamy) but this dish was very flavorful and not too heavy. We finished with the cheesecake and baklava. The baklava was better, in my opinion (cheesecake was just average).  I think this place probably has some wonderful dishes but I don't think we ordered wisely.  I should have read some reviews on Yelp before dining here!",3 star rating,Nikita P.

We  did some research on yelp, and came across numerous positive reviews for Mesa Verde. After eating here today I can honestly say the positive reviews were accurate. We ordered the Picadillo Empanda, Macro Bowl, Grilled Polenta and Picadillo Tacos. They were all very delicious, but the Grilled Polenta was my favorite...a succulent mixture of braised tomato, garbanzo stew, kale and shallot!!! Who would have thought something so healthy could be soooo yummy! The Picadillo Tacos had this mouthwatering jackfruit and tempeh filling with some other healthy delicacies. With meals like these, someone could go Vegan cold-turkey :) The customer service was also excellent.

8/28/2018,"Woodland, CA","We eat mostly vegan food in our diet, and have enjoyed a number of delicious vegan restaurants. However, we tried multiple dishes here and were thoroughly disappointed. The cashew cheese board was not very good at all. We then tried the crostinis, and it was completely bland and dominated by the burnt flavor of the crumble that was topping it. The presentation of both dishes was absolutely beautiful, though! But that doesn't count for anything when the food simply does not taste good. We did not finish eating the crostinis. At that point, we thought maybe the restaurant just doesn't do vegan food well, so we tried a vegetarian dish and ordered the margherita pizza. Although it was a step up from the vegan dishes we had tried, it was also the least delicious margherita pizza I've ever tried. The cherry tomatoes must have let too much water into the dish, so the cheese was floating in watery sauce. It also was very bland.We usually love to support any and all vegan establishments to encourage more of them to open up! However, we actively really disliked the taste of the food here, and never plan to return. When you go zero out of three on dishes, that's a bad sign. Unless we happened to try the only three dishes they don't do well?... we don't plan to find out. The things they do well are their service and their presentation of dishes, both of which are outweighed by the disappointing flavor of their food.*Edited 9/3/2018: After reading this review, the owner reached out and offered to refund our meal and give us a gift certificate in case we want to try other dishes. Adding one star to the review for them handling this in a way that I think good businesses should.*",2 star rating,Amber S.

7/10/2018,"Ontario, CA","We were vacationing in Santa Barbara and my husband found this adorable vegan/vegetarian place. We shared the cheese plate appetizer and the cheese was soooo good.  If he sold it, I'd definately take some home. I had the Harissa  Cauliflower. True Harissa flavors; a little spicey for my non-spicey palette but the vegan yogurt helped to temper that. My husband had the Macro bowl. It was a beautiful plate (bowl) of flavorful sauces, rice and veggies. The service was very good. I asked for extra yogurt, which I had to wait for, because they had to make it on the fly! Whaaaat!?! It tastes nearest to real yogurt than I have ever tasted. So good!We ordered the baklava for dessert. It is not your typical, honey laden dish. It is light (believe it or not), with a tangy flavor to offset the sweet. No honey on this dish. The ice cream would fool your non-vegan friends, it's soooo creamy. Jamal, the owner, is a cool, engaging delight of a guy. I have urged him to open up a location near me. Hopefully he'll consider it. If your vegan and your in Santa Barbara, you gotta pop in and relax on their beautiful, relaxing patio. We will definately come back again next time we're in town.",5 star rating,Lisa B.

8/27/2015,"Brooklyn, NY","Literally the best vegan meal of my life. I would say the best meal of my life, but I can't remember what I used to like when I ate meat and dairy and how this would compare... It's irrelevant though and meat eaters with a sophisticated palate will greatly enjoy this place too. I live in Brooklyn, NY and have eaten plant based meals at some of the best restaurants around the world and Mesa Verde wins. So much attention was paid to selecting the farmers market fresh, organic produce, so much thoughtfulness was paid to the layering of flavors and the chef clearly has tremendous knowledge of world cuisines and ingredients. Vegetarian restaurants in general can get pretty heavy handed with salt, oil, processed vegetable protein and the like to make up for the lack of meat and dairy but Mesa Verde really celebrates the ingredients. Each component is seasoned to enhance its natural flavor to create really complex palates all with such a light hand, and with such nuance that it was never overpowering. And the presentation is beautiful. This is the antithesis of culinary school corny plating, where they drizzle some balsamic reduction line on the plate and smudge it with a spoon. It's just really about showing off the gorgeous ingredients. My entree looked like a rustic wildflower bouquet. I ordered the rooibus + ginger iced tea and macro bowl. The tea was perfectly brewed, light and refreshing and they weren't afraid to serve it unsweetened, because it didn't need sweetener. The macro bowl was a gift that kept giving. Lemony dinosaur kale, savory chunky hummus, spicy carrots, perfectly cooked white beans and quinoa topped with a few charred shishito peppers and a tiny grilled head of cabbage which I dipped into the two sauces (fresh chimichurri and lemon tahini) that lovingly accompanied the already very flavorful dish.For desert, the chocolate cake. There was some sort of chocolate sauce, brittle, some herbs and flowers. It was so good I couldn't really stop to analyze. You guys, it was insane. My husband, who is new to a plant based diet, ordered the Caesar salad and the Juniper smoothie. Both of which he promptly scarfed down and declared amazing. He was scraping the bottom of the mason jar for any final drops of the banana, date smoothie concoction. We're in the car driving down to LA and he says he would go back now. I can't wait for them to open the NY, SF, and LA branches.",5 star rating,RC W.
6/6/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Cannot wait to go back!We ordered the Hibiscus & Chamomile Kombucha, Helios juice and The Sun smoothie. All so delicious! Love love love!!The polenta fries were so good! The main dish, Grilled polenta is very similar-- I would recommend not ordering that meal dish but instead the appetizer to share. The polenta fries were so flavorful and crunchy in the outside. for the grilled polenta, we ended up flavoring it w other dishes we ordered, it was definitely lacking.Macro Bowl had great flavors! The Peruvian Purple Potato Burger was so so tasty. Next time I will ask for less Dijon mustard bc it was overpowering many of the other flavors.I wouldn't call the V Cheesecake w blueberry sauce, cheesecake but still had such incredible flavors. Perhaps more of a creamy, rich and sweet bar.",4 star rating,Ava S.

2/25/2019,"Chicago, IL","Mesa Verde, without a doubt, should be a destination restaurant for Vegans and Vegetarians alike and all others interested in ethical, healthy and compassionate food. The food at Mesa Verde is innovative, sophisticated, cultured and incredibly delicious. The menu consistently wows and delights the senses. The taste and presentation are utterly spectacular and keeps getting better every time we go. I always learn from their menu about vegan food options that I never knew existed, like cashew cheese, macadamia yogurt and jackfruit 'chorizo.' Get the Grilled flatbread with Hummus and as of late the Roasted Winter Roots, but try everything on the menu as it's all worthwhile. And you must save room for dessert and tea. The Baklava is the absolute best I have ever had anywhere. So grateful this restaurant is in beautiful Santa Barbara and not LA or the Bay Area as one would expect to find such a high caliber Organic Vegan/Vegetarian restaurant. Yes, it is not an inexpensive choice, but one deserves a treat once in a while and the prices are so worth it. You get what you pay for here with no regrets. My only wish is that they would take reservations for less than 6 people so that we would not have to wait for a table (even though it's worth the wait). Also, parking is not abundant. Love Mesa Verde!",5 star rating,Cyndi A.

I dragged my husband along on this trip so he got to enjoy Mesa Verde.Enjoyed the picadillo empanadas. There were some well spiced blackbeans under the empanadas. The jackfruit chorizo street tacos were delicious - haven't had savory jackfruit before and this was a nice surprise. Well spiced but not spicy.The smoked pulled mushroom main course dish was super tasty and also had jackfruit chorizo included.Finally, ended the meal with cashew cheesecake. It was absolutely delicious. If I had anything I wish were different it would be that I wish the prosecco was Spanish cava instead... as cava is always good from any vineyard and prosecco is hit or miss.",5 star rating,Kat D.

After eating their delicious food, and seeing how many wonderful selections they have, it was impossible to think of going anywhere else!But I can't extol praises for the cafe without mentioning Edgar, who is perhaps the world's kindest waiter. If you want to see someone who loves his job and loves people, look no further. Edgar welcomed us with a big smile and a generous attitude, wanting only to make sure we were happy. He's knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and enthusiastic about each dish. He was as much a reason for our returning as the food was.One final note: You gotta try the baklava!",5 star rating,Dallis R.

The owner surprised us with a baklava and I gotta say you need to order that as your dessert. Wish it could be closer to us, we live in LA and the drive is far but oh so worth it.

But while service and ambiance add to the experience the most important thing is the food. Both dishes we ordered were bland. Jamal offered us a free sample of baklava, which was tasty.

5/3/2017,"ME, ME","A number of local pubs list Mesa Verde as one of SB's top ten eateries. I now know why.On a trip up the California coast, we stopped in beautiful SB for the day and an overnight. As happens when you're on the road (and a plant-based vegan), our lunch was one of those ""meh"" experiences where your choices are limited and when you're done eating, you're disappointed.Mesa Verde was the polar opposite. Billed as organic and vegan, they did not disappoint.Fantastic food all around. Lots of small plates ideal for sharing with your dining partner(s). We loved their polenta fries. I'm guessing they were ""fried"" in olive oil or something similar, they were perfectly crisp on the outside, but with the characteristic polenta goodness sealed inside. They served the fries with caramelized onions and smoked white beans, with a dash of thyme.The California salad (when in California...) was that perfect dish of healthy goodness you crave when your odometer is ticking up and no matter what your intentions are, eating on the run isn't the same as being home. Kale, greens, cucumber, radish, carrots, sprouts, with avocado and walnuts, as well as currants and leeks. The salad is dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and a touch of dill. Yummy veggie goodness!!We shared the vegan gluten flatbread pizza. It was more than enough for two and brought half of it back with us to share for breakfast. Topped with heirloom tomatoes. marinara. cashew cheese. smoked eggplant, along with tempeh bacon. OMG! Oh, and caramelized onion for good measure and a hint of basil. If you have room for dessert, they have amazing vegan options. The cheesecake and baklava stand out, with the latter being their signature dessert item. You don't have to be a vegan or vegetarian to appreciate food this good. I can't imagine anyone with a functional palette capable of tasting not being blown away by Mesa Verde's variety and attention to detail.Not only is the food out of this world, but servers like ours, Sarah, make coming here for the first time an experience consistent with California and the vibe of this beautiful region of the state.",5 star rating,Jim B.

8/27/2016,"Studio City, CA","I can't stop telling everyone how amazing this place is. I came here for lunch while passing through town, from Los Angeles. I'm used to eating at a lot of great vegan restaurants since I live near so many in LA. I decided to try this place out and I was not at all disappointed. The atmosphere was lovely. I think the August weather complimented the outdoor patio, surrounded by beautiful flowers and plants, perfectly. The tables were comfortable and the dishes aesthetically pleasing. The waiters and hosts were very helpful, kind, and had a great sense of humor! The food was incredible!! I couldn't decide between the jackfruit filled taco or the potato filled taco, so the chef said he would make one of each for me. They were delicious and looked just as good as they tasted. I was especially impressed by the blueberry chipotle sauce. The ceasar salad was full of flavor, looked super cute, and the croutons were especially tasty. The BLT was outstanding and the ""bacon"" texture was perfect. The flatbread on it was so fresh it tasted homemade. When I heard they had vegan dessert as well, I had to try it. I had the cheesecake and the baklava with vanilla ice cream. After I finished, I had to ask the waiter if it was actually vegan because it tasted so real! Everything was very authentic. I would gladly make the drive to Santa Barbara more often JUST to eat at Mesa Verde. I think it could turn a lot of carnivores onto a more plant-based lifestyle. I am so grateful I found a place like this. It was perfect!",5 star rating,Devyn D.

2/1/2015,"Las Vegas, NV","Two words: Go veganTry this place and go vegan for a meal! I was a vegan for 10 months during my third year at UCSB. I remember going out to eat at vegan restaurants and I found most places to be overpriced and lacking flavor. It gave vegans a bad name!We ordered the mushroom tacos, falafels, and risotto. I would recommend just sharing dishes to try out the items. My favorite was the risotto which had a rich flavor and spiced chirozo! The mushroom taco is simple, yet hearty. They are seasoned to perfection and had the right amount of spices.I really wanted to order dessert, but I was so stuffed. Next time, I will have to try their baklava. I heard that it comes with a pomegranate molasses sauce. After my dining experience at Mesa, I may try to go on a vegan diet again! As long as their chef cooks for me... :D",4 star rating,Jen B.
2/11/2017,"Reno, NV","Once again yelpers do not lie. This place definitely deserves the five star rating that it has right now. On this Rainy Saturday night, the  wait was still 15 to 25 minute. Not wanting to crowd the lobby, I asked the host to call me on my cell phone while my girlfriend and I waited in the car. In less than 20 minutes the call came that our table for two was ready.Our server hustled to bring our menus and take our orders but not in the way that was rushing us more in a way to be more helpful more quickly. We had the roasted cauliflower with  sausage patties on top of lentils and the vegan gluten-free empanadas on top of smoky black beans. The black beans were out of this world like nothing I've ever had before. I won't give away the secret how they are prepared - you will have to ask the chef or owner himself.The cauliflower was tender and a little bit spicy. The empanada was crispy and the chimichurri topping was a nice balance of cool and hot.And then dessert. OMG dessert. Today's special was a vegan gluten-free bread pudding with the soy ice cream with a salted topping of some sort. There was a brandy sauce on the bottom that we drank out of the cauldron like Kool-Aid.The gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake is what earns this venue its five star rating. The cashew crust was buttery and grainy the way a  good crust should be. The coconut ice cream on the side and whatever that sauce was on the bottom deserves to be licked clean off the plate.Another important facet: nearly every single ingredient of the entrees is listed on the menu. This venue offers a ton of gluten-free options which is key for my celiac-ridden girlfriend.

7/30/2016,"Goleta, CA","Why didn't I try Mesa Verde sooner? It is a gem! I went there for lunch on Thursday. I was immediately pleased by the clean, modern, cool, slightly funky atmosphere. We sat outside on the patio. They don't crowd in too many tables and chairs like some places do, so I was completely comfortable and knew my lunch conversation was private.I'm not the most adventurous eater, and I'm no vegetarian, so I wasn't sure how I was going to like Mesa Verde, but I was immediately excited when I read the menu. I wanted to try everything! As we were trying to decide what to order, one of the owners brought us each a fresh squeezed veggie juice. What? It was delicious and the owner is a real charmer. He knows how to please customers, that is for sure!We ordered three items to share. The polenta fries were exceptional. Crispy (not oily) and and really flavorful. The mixture of the flavors - polenta, smoked zucchini, other small pieces of veggies, white beans, thyme, and other things I can't name, something spicy, were just SCRUMPTIOUS. This dish alone guarantees that I'll return to Mesa Verde.We also had the empanadas - wow, unlike anything I've ever had before. Just terrific. The smoked pulled mushroom sandwich was another hit. I never knew vegetarian food could be this delicious. I kept wishing I had more room in my stomach so I could eat more. Oh, I almost forgot! The presentation of the food is world class. Beautiful! And you can eat the pretty flowers they accent their dishes with (and I did).I was blissed out, having enjoying every single aspect of my Mesa Verde experience, when the owner reappeared bearing a plate of the BEST BAKLAVA I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. The heavens opened and the angels sang. Brilliant move, owner. I am hooked. And yes, I'll write your Yelp review. A+ for Mesa Verde.",5 star rating,Cara Leigh E.

1/19/2020,"Los Angeles, CA","For the pretentiousness and the big deal they make about themselves the food is alright and the service is down in the dump. The artichoke pesto ricotta pizza was amazing. Hence the 2 stars. The tagine was meh and very small quantity for an entre. Put a couple of more spoons of couscous on it, so a person can call it  a dinner. And the worst part is the service. When you enter, they out right ignore you. Will not look up from register, will not say hi, will keep walking past, just ignoring you with an attitude. 30 more seconds and I would've gone to TacoBell across the street for a more filling meal. The bad service continued every step of the way. The restaurant wasn't busy but still they were acting as if they are doing you a favor by letting you in. Get over yourselves guys.

1/10/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in Santa Barbara, especially if you're a vegan/vegetarian.  You won't have to look over the menu for the one or two items that most restaurants have available because the whole menu is vegan or vegetarian!  The service is also super friendly!  When my date and I originally got there, there was about a 30-minute wait, so we left to have a pre-dinner drink.  When we got back, the owner saw us and just told us it would be a minute.  I really didn't think much of it. Pretty standard.  Not to him apparently, because he apologized for making us wait too long and offered us a free drink on the house!  So, already the night started off great!  The general service all night was pretty great.  The food came out pretty quickly, and the waiter was pretty good at coming around and asking how things were or if we needed anything. To start, we had the street tacos.  They were giant!  Almost too big to hold and eat, but I did anyway!  Make sure to eat these over your plate, because you'll probably drop about a quarter of the insides as you eat.  Perfect to scoop up with your fork afterward! For my main dish, I had the Macro Bowl, while my date had the Risotto.  Not only were they beautifully presented, but both were also equally delicious.  I didn't know vegan food could taste so good!As satisfied as we both were with our meals, there was no way we were getting out of there without having some dessert.  I intended to have just one, but the owner had other plans.  As we were enjoying our delicious Ganache, he came over again to see how liked our meal and convinced us to have the Baklava as well.  Upon learning my date wasn't a big fan, he insisted we at least try this one, on him of course.  In his words, ""It's the best you'll ever have!"" Damn if he wasn't right!  It was amazing!  One of the best dining experiences I've had.  I can't wait to come back and try something else!",5 star rating,Rudy M.

We ordered the falafel bowl and burger which were both amazing. The burger was my fav, the buns we were told are made fresh daily and it is just so soft and good! We were treated to a dessert of paklava and house made ice cream, which was delicious! It was literally the best vegan ice cream I've ever tried. Good for vegans and non vegans.

Maybe dinner is the way to go as previous lunch time experience was meh, at best.Ambiance... same. Simple. Do wish the outdoor seating had shrubs or something to block off the unappealing views of the parking lot, gas station / 7-11, and the businesses across street.Service... Attentive, friendly. Food... The menu changes seasonly, so some items may go while others stay on the menu. This time around ordered 2 items from the SHARE PLATES- the Jackfruit ""chorizo"" tacos.... delicious, lots of filling, and pretty presentation. The ""pepperoni"" flatbread pizza.... cheesy and delicious, perfect appetizer to share for 2 people. The winner (& what won me over) was from MAINS- the black rice, black bean, brussels sprout, jackfruit dish with avocado, radish, and piquillo.... so flavorful and delicious, the perfect vegan comfort dish.",4 star rating,Kinga H.

He is just remarkable. This restaurant is remarkable. To be honest, I'm not much of a vegan foodie like my wife but I would be kidding myself if I didn't say how much I absolutely enjoyed the food here.

10/9/2015,"Los Olivos, CA","Fresh and flavorful vegan lunch! We ordered two lemonades, one sparkling and one with rose, both were refreshing and light, not over sweetened. Our lunches were the empanadas and the pulled mushroom. Both were spicy, the harissa sauce was no joke hot, but flavorful and worth the heat. The ingredients were all so modern and fresh. I ordered baklava to share and I was glad I did, the sauce that accompanied it was tart and a surprising flavor to pair with baklava but it worked! Normally it's a super sweet syrup but they went the other way and I loved it. Wish we lived closer, I'd go every week.

The hummus was also very good. The jackfruit tacos were unique, I have never had jackfruit as part of a main entree anywhere before. The tacos were tangy in taste. The second entree was a Moroccan bowl with cous cous and vegetables. This was also very good. Coming to the desserts, the pumpkin cheesecake stole the show! It was simply amazing. There was a spicy powder sprinkled around the cake, which contrasted with the sweetness - simply too good. We also had the baklava, again pretty good. What I loved about the baklava, is the molasses, which was sour and went really well with the sweet baklava.Overall, Mesa Verde is a very unique experience and highly recommended in a visit to Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Malathi R.

11/13/2016,"Daly City, CA","Subpar food, but a gorgeous, unique setting. Came here to try something healthy, something fresh, Californian, and vegetarian, but left decidedly disappointed. We ordered the macro bowl and the red onion-'sausage' pizza. The macro bowl consisted of black quinoa and black beans topped with hummus, one piece of grilled Bok Choy, a bit of wilted kale, a pinch of sprouts, and three or four slices of radish. The hummus was flavorless, thick and heavy like store bought hummus, not airy freshly made Greek hummus. The kale was salty. The radish was weirdly flavorless (perhaps it should have been pickled). It was a pretty picture, but nothing else. We asked for some sauce to put on top and the waitress brought us two choices. The green chimichurri brightened the dish a lot, but alas, as it was served, I cannot recommend. The onion sausage pizza was edible and that's it. The crust was a nice light texture, perfectly baked, but again, flavorless. It was topped with a schmear of red sauce, plenty of vegetarian sausage, red onion slices, some basil leaves, and cashew cheese (they were out of vegetarian ricotta). The vegetarian sausage tasted ok. The cashew cheese just doesn't go with pizza. It doesn't melt, it doesn't have flavor, it doesn't look good. I ate the red onions separately because they were too harsh, still tasting a bit raw. Again, I can't recommend. HOWEVER, the setting was wonderful, uniquely rustic chic and romantic. We sat outside by the bougainvillea and gazed at the colorful flowers surrounding the patio. The service was impeccable and attentive. I just wish the food tastedgood.",2 star rating,Keys W.
5/21/2017,"Corona, CA",2nd visit we got the cashew grilled cheese. Which was 5 star. Really great choice. More than enough food for one person. Also did the falafel bowl which was 4 1/2 star. Wish there was a little more pickeled turnips and cucumber on it. But overall tasty. Falafel was soft and delicious. I wasn't as big a fan of the veggie sausage choice on it also. We also had the baklava and pistachio ice cream. It was in the top 3 best desserts I've ever had in my life.,5 star rating,Zia B.

1/19/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","This is quite possibly the best restaurant ever.  It has aroused a feeling in me I have never experienced before.  I actually have severe anxiety that it won't last.  NOT because they are doing anything wrong, in fact they do everything right; its just that it feels too good to be true. It keeps me up at night.  Mesa Verde represents everything a restaurant should be. It has incredible, local and healthy food, served in beautiful, artful ways, by some of the most pleasant people you can imagine.  Of the many times I have visited, I have been greeted personally by the owner EACH time. He always checks in and makes sure every person is having a great experience and if he can't accommodate someones wishes, he goes out of his way to make it right.  In fact, one time there were no seats available so he told my group to come back in half an hour and he would make sure there was space.  When we came back he acted sincerely grateful and ended up not charging us for one of our deserts.  It was honestly embarrassing because there is no way I would ever not come back to this place....As if things couldn't get any better, I recently learned from a reliable source, unaffiliated with the restaurant, that Mesa Verde is the Santa Barbara Farmers Market's best customer. Proof of the quality of their food, and of their support for the local community.  The only thing I will caution is that the Macro Bowl, under the entree list, is really more of a salad.  If you are looking for a super healthy, lighter meal, I highly suggest it; but if you want something super flavorful and filling, I would try ANY of their other entrees. The last thing I should mention is that you cannot die without trying their deserts.  I am not a desert person at all, but I get it every time I come here.  They are all super unique and delicious.  Enjoy!",5 star rating,Baird K.

The restaurant itself is really great with a very cool peaceful vibe inside and out. The wait staff was outstanding! They were very attentive throughout the meal and very kind to boot! And the food...holy wow - AMAZ-BALLS! I had the Green Plant Bowl - which was a work of art and also delivered on mind-blowing flavor.

For mains, we had the Gluten Free Pizza with cashew cheese that melted in our mouths, the Moroccan Fez over couscous - a tagine supreme - and the Summer Vegetable Pasta with zucchini pasta sliced into ribbons, not spiralized, which was like having wide pasta noodles that hold the sauce and flavor.

As soon as the Manager found out this was our first time in the restaurant he made it his mission to give us the best experience ever! I had the Wild Mushroom risotto, which was peppery, and had a nice kick to it. I had a bite of the jack fruit street tacos and honestly I must get them next time! One of the best things on our table was their cheese plate with nuts, and the baklava was so yummy (of course I have never had this dessert, but I will definitely order this the next time around)!Definitely a place worth checking out!

9/16/2016,"San Francisco, CA","If you live in a city, your restaurant experiences would have been very different from what you'll see here.Food: good concept, but chef can't execute. Everything except the cashew-cheese strawberry cheesecake was sub-par.Plus, it was my birthday. We planned a trip all the way from SF and picked this place for my birthday dinner. I called and spoke with the owner Jamal weeks in advance, and told him we were picking this place for my birthday. He said I should ask for him when we went.My husband and mum told our server it was my birthday while I was in the restroom, who didn't respond to it at all. Later, I asked for Jamal, and the server said he wasn't in. I told her we had had a chat, and she responded with silence and a smile. She didn't offer up his brother, who is also the owner and was in. Jamal's brother brought us the food, and I told him about my chat with Jamal, and that it was my birthday. Nothing. Not even a ""Happy Birthday.""I get that not all restaurants do something special for birthday customers. But they should at least say ""Oh, Happy Birthday"" to the person, or, if the family/friends are telling them while the person is away, they should be trained to say something like, ""I'm sorry, we don't do anything for birthdays."" Anything apologetic and polite.It doesn't really cost much to give out one candle on the dessert that people are paying for. No one is asking for a free item. We are just asking to feel special on our birthday. We've seen candles on dessert (usually along with a happy birthday written on the plate), at the biggest and smallest of places over the years. It's awful that we picked a place 400 miles away for my birthday, and they couldn't help us mark it in any way.Plus, the food sucked. Thought the cheesecake was good. But without a candle. (Or any sort of birthday marker.)UPDATE: the owner Jamal, who was away that day, has reached out repeatedly to offer me a full refund. Of course we wouldn't take it, but it is a nice gesture and it's clear he feels bad about what happened. Most baffling is the fact that he says they *do* birthday markers. The staff is aware, but all three people (hostess, server, owner's brother, each notified separately) decided that day, I guess, to just be jackasses.Oh, well. I hope he trains his staff to give a s*** about customers when he's away. That said, I wanted to write this update because it reflects really well on the owner (except that he clearly has no control of his staff!).",1 star rating,Jui C.

My girlfriend had the pulled mushroom plate so good Smokey flavorful with a bit of zing!

Served on a homemade corn tortilla with a lemony creme fraiche sauce and a semi-spicy salsa were a great compliment to the tacos. Who would think to make mushroom tacos! If you're a mushroom lover like me then you will enjoy these. I highly recommend them. The next item we tried was the flatbread & hummus. They serve both on a very pretty wooden plank. The flatbread itself came out perfectly grilled, and it had some kinda seasoning on top that gave it a hint of flavor. The hummus was perfect! It's very creamy with olive oil drizzled on top. I couldn't stop eating it! Last we ordered the margherita pizza. This pizza was perfect with just the right amount of ingredients. It didn't have too much cheese and I was able to dip the ends of the pizza in the hummus to finish that up. The olive oil, tomatoes, and hint of salt were perfect! No complaints here.

I've tried the following dishes and highly recommend them: -Picadillo Empanada* (my recent favorite)-Picadillo Tacos -Falafel, Izatsiki, Hummus, Cucumber [..]-Black Bean, Walnut and Grilled Kale BurgerThe main reason I come here is really for their Poseidon smoothie drink, which is AMAZING. It is pricy for a smoothie at $10 but it's totally worth it (and better they make it that I!) The service is quick and attentive. The place is a bit on the dark side with lighting but you can enjoy your meal outside. It is a bit out of the way for me and parking lot can be tricky if it is completely full.",5 star rating,Roxanna V.
8/7/2017,"Oakland, CA","We visited Mesa Verde the first time months ago while traveling through the area with my sister, who was heading to Ventura to buy a kayak.  We had a great meal, and planned to come back to Santa Barbara to eat here again as soon as possible.With my birthday coming up, we decided this was a good excuse to spend a couple days in Santa Barbara and eat again at Mesa Verde.  As vegans, we are always excited to find restaurants that offer us many dining options, as opposed to the usual single vegan option dish available on most restaurant menus.We hit Mesa Verde mid-afternoon, shortly after we arrived in SB.  The location is convenient, right on Cliff Drive on the northwest side of SB, oddly placed between a gas station and a 7-11, but the parking was easy.  The ambiance was as we remembered with unique dark furnishings, numerous tropical plants, lots of outdoor shade and simple country style place settings.  The restaurant was not too busy, and the weather was perfect..so we sat outside on the patio in a private corner.  Our server was Madeline, a super friendly yet very professional college student who could not have been a more helpful or enjoyable server with whom to engage.  Madeline made us feel like old friends, and we immediately felt super comfortable and relaxed.   Overwhelmed by the wonderful and varied menu, we agreed to share several items, and rush back the next day to try more.  We ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, the mushroom umami burger and the ""cesar"" salad.  The grilled cheese was yummy, with a rich and gooey cashew cheese, green tahini and poblano pepper filling wedged between 2 big, thick, but light and airy, crispy grilled homestyle bread slices.  Although not really reminiscent of grilled cheese to us, it was quite delicious.  The airy texture and ample portions of toast were just enough to offset the rich filling; the entire sandwich was quite well balanced.  Served with a few seasoned, crispy homemade potato chips and slaw..we both agreed we needed to come back and order it again soon!  The mushroom umami burger was very tasty, rich with layers of varying flavors, but the burger itself could have used more structural integrity and texture (maybe searing and caramelizing the patty would help). The ""cesar"" salad was gorgeous, topped with purple radish slices and tiny blue flowers.  The salad was just the perfect offset to our otherwise rich and decadent lunch choices.  When we first met Madeline my husband had casually mentioned it was my birthday week, and apparently she took notice.  At the conclusion of our meal she brought us some baklava with ice cream, pistachios, pomegranate sauce and sumac, topped with a birthday candle.  Wow!  Not something I would have thought to order (I usually lean toward chocolate), but it may have been the best item we tried!  Crispy layers of baklava and nuts, paired with rich vanilla ice cream and the pomegranate molasses topped with powdered sumac, which lent a delightful and tangy citrus element..ideal to end a rich and decadent meal!  I'm not sure, but I believe we licked the plate clean!  We chatted with Madeline throughout our meal, and she made us feel right at home.  We learned Madeline was soon leaving to attend UCSD, a loss for Mesa Verde and its customers..but a wonderful new opportunity for Madeline, and any San Diego business smart enough to hire her.  After lounging around the patio for an extended time during our leisurely meal, we finally said goodbye to Mesa Verde and Madeline, making plans to return the next day.The next noon we headed back to Mesa Verde and again chose to sit on the patio.  Our server was Edgar.  Edgar was jovial and conscientious..confirming Mesa Verde takes great care to hire friendly and professional staff.  We ordered the falafel sandwich, the BLTA and the polenta fries.  The falafel looked like a work of art, and was as tasty as it was pretty to look at.  The BLTA was pretty good, but the tempeh bacon was not as rich and smokey as some we have tried.  The polenta fries were interesting, but perhaps a heavier choice than we should have tried as a lunch appetizer.  We ordered the baklava again for dessert, and it did not disappoint! Lunch left us so full we decided to skip dinner again, but knowing a noon meal might leave us hungry later in the evening, we later picked up a macadamia ricotta pizza, plus one slice each of their strawberry cheesecake and chocolate cake for later.  The pizza crust was elegantly simple, with a subtle crunch to the crust.  The macadamia ricotta was fluffy and creamy, paired well with herbs, arugula and their beet root bacon.  Delicate but decadent..it was the perfect late night snack.  The strawberry cheesecake was light, creamy, rich and tangy while the chocolate cake was over the top gooey, rich, chocolatey and textured, with candied macadamia nuts, chocolate ganache and cacao nibs.  Another amazing meal from Mesa Verde.  We cannot wait to return and try more!!!",4 star rating,Mark G.
1/1/2017,"Miami, FL",Found this incredible place while visiting Santa Barbara with mom. Everything was AMAZING!!!! The hummus was beautiful!

1/28/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Food: great vegan food with a variety of options. I recommend the butternut squash pasta with cashew cheese. We also had the raja tacos for an appetizer. These are great if you like roasted veggies and medium-spicy food. My partner ordered one of the pizzas, which was large enough to share with another person. We also had the baclava with ""ice cream"" ... wow this was my favorite part of the meal! Big enough for two. Menu: the menu is decent sized, the only strange part is that none of the items have a title so the menu ends up looking like a block of text.Seating: the restaurant is a little cold with awkward tables that you may hit your knees on. Also, the chair are hard metal (not very cozy or comfortable). Pricing: appetizers range from $10-20 dollars, entrees range from $12-$20. Well worth it to not have to spend the time making vegan food. Service: great service, very polite waiters, and fast delivery. The only issue I had was that my order came out about 10-15 sooner than my partners and while I was still eating my appetizer.",3 star rating,Taylor T.

The burger was served with what looked like and had the texture of calamari but was in fact actuality fried lemon!

My wife are avid ""Yelpers"" and always look for the best. This place did not disappoint. We started with the polenta fries, which were crisped to perfection. This dish along would have been worthy enough of the 5 stars. My wife ordered the BLT and I ordered the Street Taco. As an avid meat eater, I was somewhat skeptical; however, I'm a foodie so I'm up to trying anything once. I have to say that these dishes seriously convinced me that meat isn't needed in everything. To top the customer service off, the manager gave us a complementary desert that was amazing. This hands down is a place that you must stop at while in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Dee ..

It was the best I've had and it's served with a vegan ice cream. I'm going to have sweet dreams about this baklava because it was so freakin delicious.Great atomsphere and super friendly employees.

6/2/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","I decided to check this place out on my way back to Los Angeles and I am so glad I did. The location is in a bit of a weird spot because it is in between a 7 Eleven and a gas station, but who really cares. The restaurant itself is super adorable. It has a bit of a rustic and romantic feel to it. They have an outdoor patio that was quite nice as well. My BF and I ordered the Grilled Cheese and the BLTA for our entrees and both were out of this world!! The Grilled Cheese took my childhood favorite to a whole new level and made it one the best sandwich I have ever tasted!! It had cashew cheeze, grilled poblano pepper, green tahini, pickled mustard seeds, dijon, radishes, dill pickle, and fennel all inside of this Texas toast inspired sourdough bread.  It was also served with some amazing potato chips and coleslaw! The BLTA had heirloom tomatoes, little gem lettuce, avocado, tempeh bacon, tahini, and Dijon pickles inside of grilled flatbread. After tasting such amazing sandwiches, which were really nice portions, we had to try their dessert. We opted for the Strawberry Cheesecake and it was the best vegan cheesecake I have ever had! Our server Edgar made the experience even better! He was friendly and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back to eat some amazing vegan food soon! If you're in the area or passing through, this is a must!! You will not regret it!",5 star rating,Sessalie S.

I never had some of the flavor's he loves combining. Pink grapefruit and magical little cucumbers, eggplant shiitake stack with a crazy good sauce.

Well to begin with, service was good and waiters were friendly! the lunch was great, I got a beet salad with their homemade yogourt sauce, not abondant but simple and fresh! My friend had the Unami sandwich with homemade pita bread and small salad which was delicious! Then we ordered a pana cotta dessert to share with orange peel, the flavor was amazing but the price was also not marked on their menu which happened to be the same price than our lunches! $14 dollars for a small cup! A little too pricy for my taste! I could have a gourmet dessert in a fancy restaurant for that same price! Are you kidding me! We asked the waiter for confirmation in case they did make a mistake! Nope! Clearly they need to review their prices! They also need to mark it on their menus! Oh well! We live and learn! And for that reason I wouldn't give them the 5 stars!",4 star rating,Evy F.

I have been in that restaurant so many times that i never doubted or hesitated to order anything that was on the menu, but now what can i say other then i would never eat anything from that restaurant ever again unless i know for sure it went back to how it was, and in my opinion that restaurant is going down, that restaurant just lost 12 regular customers, my family and me.

I don't appreciate sitting on a hard chair with no cushioning, and struggling to hear my table mates as there is not a single piece of fabric in the room to absorb sound from other tables.The prices are over the top.I guess this sums up the changing culture in Santa Barbara...The Sojourner goes out of business, and Mesa Verde thrives.It is a brave new world.",2 star rating,Luna M.

I've been here many times, and for some reason, when I came in tonight with my girlfriends, the staff was incredibly rude. We had been seated for less than 30 minutes, enjoying our food when the staff just threw boxes on the table, while we were all still eating. Didn't ask us if we wanted anything else, just threw the boxes down. And if that message wasn't clear enough, they dropped the check 2 minutes later, again, while we were still eating. They were clearly trying to push us out, despite the fact we had been seated for less than 30 minutes!

They also have fresh smoothies, espresso, kombucha. **If you leave without trying the baklava with soy ice cream, you are a fool.

1/6/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","There's five stars at this spot for a reason. I'm not vegan, but if anything would convert me to it other than an extremely hot LA vegan girl pressuring me to go ""cruelty free"", it's Mesa Verde's decadently diverse menu and delicious crafting of vegan delicacies. Their service was amazing, Hillary vibed out with us and gave on point recommendations, Julie served the beautifully presented plates with a smile and Jamal, the owner was so welcoming and friendly. He generously offered a dessert on the house since it was my girls birthday. I just ate the baklava, and I have to say along with the vegan ice cream it is one of the best desserts I've ever had - and my first job was cutting baklava for a Gyro restaurant in Seattle so I know my shit.

Not ever, that is, NEVER, have I tried food this delicious--this unique--this... fulfilling. Yes, it's borderline existential. And it's not just like there's one or two dishes here that are good. It's the ENTIRE MENU. Everything is so special. Not one flavor is redundant, within the context of the menu or in relation to other restaurants. That is to say, this place stands out as one of the most inventive and distinguished flavors of Southern California. Sure, the portions could be bigger, and sure, my wallet feels a little light after coming out. But I am a better person for it. Come to Mesa Verde. Eat the food.

We were yelping ""restaurants with a view"" and this place popped up. We were disappointed to find that this place didn't have a view. It's next to a gas station. The parking was, as most places in Cali, scant, which for out of towners is slightly stress inducing and frustrating, but it was totally worth it. I'm gluten/dairy/soy free and my friend is a vegetarian. We both easily found something we could eat that was super tasty and flavorful, filling, and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. We were definitely impressed. All of the servers were very friendly and we even got to try one of their desserts on the house. Soooo gooooodd!!

The decor was rustic and the entire restaurant was really well done. The service was fantastic. The server was extremely attentive and was able to answer all questions we had about the menu.  The food, wow. Everything was fresh and they mentioned it was all organic and locally sourced food and you can definitely tell. To drink, I had the berry and ginger Kombucha and my girlfriend had the Hades smoothie. Both were great, especially my Kombucha. To eat, I had the roasted mushroom and vegetable burger and my girlfriend had the avocado toast. Both meals were fantastic.

The wait staff is very inviting, especially our waitress Hillary. The fries were amazing (Love that they added the brand and what looks like pesto?). Also the tacos (pulled mushroom) was phenomenal. You can tell the chef puts work into their recipes. Some of the items were very new to me, however i am glad that we ended up with the baklava (sp?), simply amazing.Last thing, something that caught me off guard is the atmosphere, very nice but with a gentrify(e) feeling....Mesa Verde is spanish but what does that mean? Are you concentrating on Mexican cuisine? Or just different cultures of the Americas. I do not know but I felt as if I was the only person of color there.

I was BLOWN AWAY by Mesa Verde. We ordered the flat bread and hummus appetizer - while it could use more bread and less sesame seeds for the $10, it was very tasty. She ordered the cous cous and really enjoyed the spiciness. I had the ""Umami"" mushroom burger and LOVED it. I've never had any faux-burger quite like it. Texture of the patty is soft without being crumbly and dry and it retains a lot of the great flavor from the beet dressing and butternut cheese.We finished with the baklava and ice cream and, I kid you not, it is the absolute best baklava we've ever had despite being vegan (i.e., no honey).Service was timely and polite.",5 star rating,Matthew K.
11/6/2016,"San Francisco, CA","This place is incredible. We shared a number of plates so I had the pleasure of sampling a number of the dishes. Top picks: polenta fries, brussels sprouts, patatas tacos and the burger. And for dessert: the baklava. Can't wait to go back!",5 star rating,Alex L.

4/3/2018,"Los Angeles, CA","Came up to SB for a long weekend and this place came highly recommended. They did NOT disappoint. It's a cute little spot and once you're inside it feels like you've stepped off the grid. We came on a double date and it is lovely. The food is incredibly fresh and ridiculously tasty. We tried the polenta fries, the empanadas, the market pizza (add the cashew cheese for an extra treat), and the lasagna.  Everything was so thoughtfully seasoned and nothing needed additional salt or pepper. The owner was welcoming and even stopped us on the way out to make sure we tried the baklava. Do yourself a favor and order it! Let it bless you the same way it did us! Highly recommend and we will be back!",5 star rating,Stephanie L.

12/29/2015,"San Diego, CA","I am beginning to feel like a 5-Star snob, but this place really deserves it. The atmosphere is that of casual but the food is Michelin Star worthy.This place is Not and I repeat does NOT deserve the distinctive status of- ""good for a Vegan/Veg Restaurant"", but rather Good to GREAT period. I believe as a meat loving carnivore, you could and would not feel the sentiment of ""Where's the Beef?"", cuz this place takes classic, comforts, & moderns, then fuses them together, creating well-composed dishes of delishesness.Essentially our table ordered four dishes and shared bites with each other. Sadly, my selection was the least satisfying (The Risotto) but most likely because everything else was so bloody good. The Sweet Potato trio (chip, baked wedge, mash) with brussels was lushess, as was the fried Brussel and White Bean Puree. Talk about an incredible use of vinegar with just the right touch of acidity. Now the surprise of the evening and something I would never order out- The Lasagna! Somehow, they made a non-dairy cheese (nut-based), taste Better than a ricotta. Served in a min-cast iron skillet with pita&zataar equates to that of a HomeRun!Service was sincere and ambiance was moy tranquillo. This place is the ""Best"" Vegan restaurant I have frequented and I will return. Look out SB, the Veggie is taking over and even as a meat-luv'n fool; I am okay with it :)",5 star rating,Stephen D.
3/19/2016,"Goleta, CA","Mesa Verde is a delicious vegetarian option! A little bit pricey for dinner, but a good bargain for lunch. The smoothies and kombuchas are very good -- I would recommend splitting them. Also, I would stick to the basics on the menu -- the polenta fries, Caesar salad, falafel, and empanadas are amazing, but I was very disappointed when, after feeling adventurous, I ordered the mushroom risotto. Love mushrooms and risotto, but this was not well-seasoned and the rice used wasn't very good. The desserts are delicious but I was disappointed to find that my favorite, the baklava, had run out of its accompanying sorbet several times in a row. They substituted with coconut cream, which was way too rich. The pumpkin cheesecake, however, is a must!",3 star rating,Jules W.
4/10/2016,"Goleta, CA","I went to Mesa Verde last night, allured by its great reviews on Yelp. It did not disappoint me. I gave the food 4 stars, service 3.5 stars, and the 5 stars is for the overall experience. Food: we three girls shared polenta fries, California salad, the vegan GF pizza, and chocolate cake. The food is fresh and flavorful. My only complain is about the chocolate cake, a bit dry to my taste (but I do love the sea salt part!)Service: it was packed last night, so the service was lukewarm, but I understand that.Something unexpected at the end: we met Jamal (the owner I think) before leaving. He sent us warm greetings, and invited us to come back. This is not the end of the story. When I got to my car across the street (it was so packed that there's no parking spot outside the restaurant), I couldn't find my car key. I got panic, and was about to go around to look for it when I saw Jamal coming. He went all the way across the street to send me the key!! To conclude, it was a great dining experience at Mesa Verde. Will definitely go back!!",5 star rating,Nico Y.
3/30/2018,"Cumming, GA","BEST MEAL IVE EVER HAD.As a vegan living in the southeast, I never eat out at restaurants. The vegan options there are limited to say the least. My only refuge is when my husband and I visit the west coast, aka vegan food heaven. After many disappointing meals during the first half of our trip - FYI there's NOTHING good for vegans north of Santa Barbara (Carmel, Monterey, Sonoma) - Mesa Verda restored my faith in food/life/humanity.  We started with the patatas bravas tacos, had the buffalo cauliflower and the king oyster entrees, and the panna cotta and herbal 'coffee' for dessert. They also gave us a little plate of cashew cheese and crackers - OMG! Everything was phenomenal- like out of body experience good. My only regret is that I don't live here. Sigh - maybe one day.",5 star rating,Kelly C.

We dropped in Memorial Day weekend for their Sunday brunch menu and we're blown away from the flavor and presentation of their dishes. They're true artisans. We had the empanadas and potato latkes, and were floored by them. Then came the special off menu dessert "" Strawberry Shortcake"". We've never had anything like it! So delicious!!!

While passing through Santa Barbara, my wife and I found Mesa Verde on Yelp, saw it had amazing reviews, and decided to give it a try. Fortunately for us, it did not disappoint!Everything we had was delicious, but the real standouts were the ""sausage and ricotta"" pizza and the baklava with soy ice cream dessert. Hands down, this was the best vegan pizza we've had. The ricotta, which was made from macadamia nuts, was so delicate and creamy that it almost tasted like the real thing. And the baklava was rich and flaky, despite the fact that it had no butter. The staff was also great, and the owner came by and spoke with us on several occasions, which made us feel like welcomed regulars.

I eat there and I feel energized as well as nourished. The owners clearly put thought and care into the concept and execution of their vision. They also pick up all the produce at local farmer's markets, I have seen the chefs shopping there! I cannot say enough positive things. Oh, try the cheesecake and or baklava, thank me later.

Good use of spices to flavor the food.  My only gripe:  I think it's a bit overpriced for the contents (I don't thiiink the veggies were organic) and the macro bowl had a quarter head of cabbage in it and no sharp utensils to separate the tough cabbage from the stem!  Service was OK and food came out fast since veggies cook really fast.  The place seems to stay pretty busy.  They ask you to park next door at the business office since their parking lot is tiny...   although it says no restaurant parking.,4 star rating,Rou M.

I'm in love with this place. I could eat here everyday if I lived in the area. Oh and let me not forget the desserts! The vegan, gluten free pumpkin cheesecake is absolutely phenomenal.

I've had the Picadillo Empanadas, the Roasted Cauliflower, the Street Tacos, the Patatas Bravas tacos, numerous salads, several flatbreads, and a delicious variety of desserts. Everything has exceed my expectations for a plant-based restaurant in a town known for its local produce. Several times a week I dream about having unlimited access to the empanadas from Mesa Verde.

The quality of the food is absolutely outstanding, and the flavors are marvelous, creative and memorable. I found the staff, even during the lull between lunch and dinner, to be very attentive, unpretentious, and warm. Everyone there seems enthusiastic about the restaurant and its mission. I love that. If such things were possible on Yelp, I'd give 4.5 stars, but simply because it's pricey. I recognize that they are working with high quality ingredients--but the price point keeps me from rounding up the family and just heading over on impulse.

10/16/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I have eaten at Mesa Verde several times and genally like it. I am a HUGE fan of the portabello mushroom tacos and the mashed peas on toast.The service is extremely hit or miss, everyone is very nice, however it is a bit disorganized. When you walk in, I am never sure if I am suppose to seat myself or wait to be seated. The first few times we went, we were suppose to just sit. This last time, we did the same thing and grabbed a table, there were 2 of us and 3 open 4 top tables, so we sat at one of those. After 5 minutes, we were approached by a waitress asking us to wait for a 2 top that was finishing up. 15 minutes later, they hadn't moved. Another 2 top opened up so we sat, apparently that table was being set up for someone else. So, we went back to waiting. One of the owners asked if we needed a table and I explained we had been moved twice. He then sat as at the 2 top that was finishing up (20 minutes later). Not 5 minutes after we sat down, next to our original 4 top, a party of 2 sat down and started to order. You can imagine how confused we were.A good 10 minutes later we finally ordered and got our food. The mashed peas on toast were amazing. The portabello mushroom tacos also amazing. We ordered the cauliflower, not as amazing, it was ok. When we were ready to leave we sat for another 15 minutes waiting for someone to notice us, it was very busy. One of the other owners asked if everything was ok and offered to take the uneaten cauliflower off of our bill. We paid and we left.I reflect on the experience and although I was not pleased with the service, it was not that bad, but it wasn't great. I will be going to Mesa Verde as I think the food is really good, but I will try to have a snack before I go, so that if my wait time is more than 10 minutes, my blood sugar does not drop.",4 star rating,Evan S.

Next we split the Impossible Burrito, doused with spicy and delicious red chili sauce and chalk full of ground ""impossible"" burger which is a vegan ""meat"" substitute that is delicious and again satisfying!

Absolutely amazing. The food is beautifully plated, well paired, and the staff is attentive--and so nice! We went there for dinner last week and loved it so much we ended up going back for lunch the next day. As we walked in for lunch, the waiters said ""Back again!""...I loved that they remembered us. I wish they were in San Francisco too. I'd go there so often they'd swear I lived there. I highly recommend (because this is everything we ordered between our two meals):-hummus and flatbread. The caperberries placed alongside the hummus are out of this world!

I also got a little stone in my macro bowl...I understand that's just the ""farm to table"" life, but it hurt my tooth :/ ....our waitress was pretty nice and decently helpful at navigating me through my low-fat vegan stipulations...but she seemed hurried.  My boyfriend said his vegan pizza was amazing.  Not the best vegan cheese, but, all else was top notch.  Wish this place would go full vegan bc why not, your menu is already so close.

5/22/2018,"Goleta, CA",I've only been once but I absolutely love this place and will be returning again. Totally worth the price. We got the La La smoothie and it was delicious. We were about halfway through it when they came out with another one because it wasn't to the chefs liking! It's wonderful to be in a restaurant where there is still passion for the art while also being so incredibly fast at making the food. The street tacos were indescribably good with jack fruit seasoned to perfection such that you might even have slight concern that it's actually meat. As we were paying the bill Jamal gave us a desert to try on the house that was so perfectly sweet and a reminder that being vegan doesn't mean you have to forego pastries. 11 out of 10 in every way.,5 star rating,Joselyn S.

We were on our way from LA to San Luis Obispo for a wedding and stopped for lunch. Quick and friendly service from everyone we dealt with here. My fiance and I shared everything, we had:- Avocado Toast - More creamy from a hummus-like ingredient than from the avocado but still very good. Well-executed and beautiful presentation. Two large pieces of toast.- Macro Bowl (White bean and rainbow chard, quinoa, grilled cabbage, kale, hummus, romessco, broccolini, shishito peppers, tahini, chimichurri) - This bowl was also a good serving. Overwhelming quinoa and greens-based, which is fine by me. I'd definitely say lighter on the sauce and cheese (also on the shishito peppers), so if you're looking for that, be warned!- Roasted cauliflower, grilled potatoes, lentils (also served in a bowl) - I loved the taste of this one so much, I recreated it at home this week!

V GF). i would give these 3 stars. i was super curious about the butternut squash nacho cheese, but honestly, there was so little of it in the center of the empanada that there was nothing really to try.  the pickled cabbage was great, and i really liked the chimi churri part too, but the dish overall was just too much empanada crust on top of black beans. i had been hoping for a plumper empanada experience, if you know what i mean. :)the mister consumed the Moroccan Fez (seven vegetable tagine with traditional seven spices. served over couscous. carmelized onion. fried shallot. harissa. pomegranate. aleppo pepper. cilantro. V 17). this was beyond stellar, an absolute 100% 5 star dish. usually i find moroccan dishes a bit sweet, but this was just packed with fresh, bright flavors. his dish was the total star of the meal.yes, we were full, but yes, we had dessert, which proved to be another 5 star decision. we tried the Bruleed Panna Cotto (almond cream. candied orange peel. orange segments. black betty. macadamia brittle. maca V GF 14). this was some serious alchemy here. so rich and light and creamy and flavorful! definitely hit this place up, and definitely bring your furry friends!",4 star rating,Wendy S.

2/7/2016,"New York, NY","The mushroom risotto is amazing. Making risotto is hard enough as it is, but even harder when you're not using any dairy. This was smooth and creamy, even slightly cheesy. The mushrooms were crispy and plentiful. For an appetizer, I had the jackfruit chorizo street tacos. Full disclaimer: I hate spicy food, particularly jalapeños. (Yes, yes. I know I have no business being in California then.) These tacos though were delicious despite containing the evil peppers. They didn't overpower the flavor profile one bit and instead just added a kick and a touch of authentic. The best part of the meal though was the baklava with the tangy pomegranate syrup. Wow did that make me happy, and I'm not even a desserts person.  (Can I make myself sound anymore food-boring?)  To the restaurant owner: sorry I didn't get this review out when I got home last night.

Whether you are vegan, vegetarian , or omni, you will enjoy the creative, flavorful, palette-pleasing menu. Our party enjoyed everything we tried on the brunch menu: the California salad, a lemony dressed salad with more than the usual salad toppings, with the perfect additional topping of fresh herbs. The avocado toast was better than the rest: a fluffy bread topped with avocado, caramelized onions, marinated cucumber, and has a little kick. Our entrees included the fabulous Huaracha Azteca (sub avo for egg), the BLTA, and the Potato Lattke. Not a single crumb of food was left on our plates. We also had a sample of the homemade shallot cheese,  a cashew-based cheese that was on our table for less than 2 minutes before it was all eaten. We bought even more to take home!Our desserts included the delectable Baklava and chocolate cake. We lucked out and our baklava was served with their homemade white chocolate ice cream because they were out of their usual vanilla. My mouth is still watering thinking about the flakey baklava with a pomegranate balsamic reduction, moist goodness inside, and pistachio crumble topping. Not only was the food delicious, but everything was so beautifully presented. Go. You will not be disappointed. And I am eagerly awaiting a Los Angeles location soon.",5 star rating,Valerie R.

The menu is pretty intense with so many choices, so we ordered the daily tapas and took our time deciding. I have never had dandelion root coffee, but I literally want to go back tomorrow for it. It was so fulfilling. The veggie burger is huge and the empanadas are perfect every time!",5 star rating,Cheryl G.

6/27/2015,"Kirkland, WA","My family has some tough eating restrictions to deal with when eating out.  We all eat gluten free, soy free, dairy free, almond free and in addition, I am vegan.  Mesa Verde is one of the few places I have been where we did not have to compromise flavor or selection to have a good meal.  Usually vegan restaurants are very heavy on the soy and/or wheat products.  Raw food places are heavy on the cashews or almonds.  Not Mesa Verde...  The dishes here are all very very creative.  I can safely say I've not had dishes similar to any of the food I ordered.  We ordered empanadas, brussel sprouts and both types of tacos.  One of the tacos had jackfruit ""chorizo"" was some sort of blueberry jalapeño salsa.  Yes it sounds froofy but it was really tasty even if you are not a hipster foodie.We ended up stuffing our faces with way too much because the portions were generous and absolutely delicious.  This was the best meal we had on our entire California vacation this year.  This place alone would be worth the visit to Santa Barbara if you are into great food.  My son ordered a juice and they brought it out in a glass bottle with an empty glass so we could pour whatever we wanted to for him and take the rest.  A very nice touch rather than wasting nice fresh squeezed/pressed juice.  Wish we were staying in SB so we could eat here a couple more times!The waiter and rest of the staff were friendly and excellent all around.  Glad we stopped in and we'll be back next time for sure.",5 star rating,Geordy R.

It was an amazing experience. We eat here almost three times a week now if not more. Our favorites include the housemade kombucha (hibiscus rose or orange if they have it), the TACOS!, the macro bowl, the polenta fries. Basically the entire menu. It's all so amazing. Not to mention the attentive service given by not only the waiters but the owners as well. They are so kind and giving and make every single person feel special.

Mesa Verde felt like a truly authentic California experience-- every dish is vegan, nutritious, beautiful, and mouthwateringly delicious. The plates here are truly a treat for all the senses. My husband and I tried a few dishes and a desert, all were great but I especially recommend the polenta fries and the pistachio baklava. I'd make a special trip just for either of those items. We saw some pizzas going out to other tables that looked really yummy; we plan to go back tomorrow night to have one ourselves before we leave town.The service was also excellent, from the waiter who took care of us to the boy bringing us water (right on time, every time) to the owner/manager (not sure which one)-- every person we interacted with was very friendly and hospitable.

Even though I was only there for a short time, I can tell how attentive and friendly the staff is. I was offered water and was even allowed to sample some of their cold pressed juice. I tried the carrot, kale, and cucumber as well as the orange, beet, and lemon juice. My favorite was definitely the orange/beet juice, it had a great sweet juicy orange flavor and was extremely refreshing.I ordered the macro bowl and it was ready in 15 minutes or so. Everything was great, I loved the subtle heat of the chimchurri on my greens. I usually don't love quinoa, but in this bowl, it was great. The beans were a great creamy addition to the lemon tahini. I loved the occasional crunch from the radish and carrots. I will definitely be returning as the service was incredible and everything on their menu sounds fantastic.",5 star rating,Megan P.

All items are either vegetarian or vegan, but so fresh and flavorful one would never consider it the type of ""health food"" typically associated with vegetarian restaurants. The flavors are complex and well thought out, with combinations of many exotic and interesting ingredients. Favorites include the polenta fries, street tacos, hummus and fig flatbread, baclava, and the grilled peach salad. Execution of each dish is very well done, with presentation as unique as the ingredients. Service is attentive and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.

I have trouble eating out while traveling and Mesa Verde's smart alkaline balanced food pairings meant no digestion issues. Plus the food is DELICIOUS! The Poseidon smoothie tastes just like a creamy pistachio and the vegan & gluten free pumpkin cheesecake was legendary.

Finished with the chocolate cake (gf) dressed with grenache, macadamia nut brittle  (what?), cocoa mousse?.  A bit of each and how delish!  Added the herbal coffee, which is detox, digestive aid...stop it!  What an amazing treat this vegan cuisine was at every sip and bite!  DO VISIT!",5 star rating,Angela T.

It wasn't too crowded, it was just about 11:30 after all.  We looked over the lunch menu for a couple of minutes and quickly decided.  I had the Patatas Bravas, he had the Empanadas and we both opted for the Polenta Fries.  Fries came out first and oh my word, SO good.  We had almost devoured those when our meals came out.  The tacos were incredible and I had a bite of the hubby's empanada which was also great as well. We were stuffed.Then we given the predicament of dessert....do we want it?  Yup!  It didn't take long for us to decide on the Baklava.  We can't get vegan baklava around these parts so we went for it.  It was amazing.  Seriously, I am sad that this place isn't closer to us.  It'll definitely be a pit stop any time we're heading up the 101.",5 star rating,Jayme L.

Sometimes vegan and ""health"" food is a chore to eat--I do it because I know it is good for me rather than craving it.

We had everything from a salad to pizza and all vegan/vegetarian  selection you would NEVER know!!! Delicious!!!! The owner was there and recognized my friend from the local farmers market. They hugged and was later forgotten we'd seen him until our server brought us out two complimentary desserts!!! can't even get over the taste in these vegan desserts.

My boyfriend had a mushroom burger that he really liked (I tasted it and preferred mine). Why I don't give it 5 stars- I have to say I was disappointed by the glorious-looking polenta fries. They were a bit plain and seemed to need some spices cooked into them.. That, and the desserts costed as much as the entrees.

My boyfriend and I are Santa Barbara locals and big proponents of plant-based cuisine. So we were so excited when Mesa Verde opened up!We have eaten there twice now and have been shocked to find the food passible at best and inedible at worst. We tried ordering lots of different dishes but everything was tinged with muddled spicy flavors that were extremely overpowering. Lots of brownish hues, beans, and overlapping sauces on each plate. The polenta fries were served in a deep-fried mishmash, all sticking together and leaving a pool of grease in their wake. Sixty six dollars later, we left still slightly hungry and deeply in need of ice cream. We walked out feeling confused about how such beautiful ingredients could lead to such highly unappealing dishes. The drinks, tea and service however, were lovely! The concrete floors lend to a somewhat chilly atmosphere, but overall the ambiance was far better then the food we ate.",2 star rating,Gabriela L.

Both dishes had a slightly more sour taste, and not salty enough, than we expected, but hey that's probably just our preference. At the end of the meal, we regretfully turned away from ordering dessert since we were stuffed (and had leftovers).

It's unlike any other!Their menu offers interesting flavor and texture combinations. I assure you that vegetarian, vegan, and meat eaters alike will find something enjoyable on their menu. If you're a mushroom lover, you must order the Pulled Smoked Mushroom! It was slightly salty, but the grilled flatbread balanced it out. The ""pulled"" texture was a new take on something already familiar.I will say, however, the service was not quite attentive.

10/16/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","My boyfriend and I very much enjoyed our experience at Mesa Verde. I ordered the jackfruit tacos with a side of avocado, which were served in lettuce cups and beautifully seasoned (you would never guess it's made from the smelliest fruit in the world) and very yummy. I also really appreciated the generous size of the avo side (1/2 the fruit) when you normally only get a couple slices at other places. BF had the potato latkes with a side of poached egg and also really enjoyed it. We're both meat eaters but I just wanted to try something new. The kombucha they had on that day was also really good (passion green tea, I believe) and even after we had declined dessert and paid the check, they presented us with a sample of their delicious baklava and soy ice cream, which was just the perfect finish to our meal! I've had baklava in Turkey and this was really amazing, so that should say something. Really worth trying this place!",5 star rating,Paula S.

7/2/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","One of my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. I am the most pickiest person when it comes to food...but I LOVE their food!!!!So amazingly good. I'm not even vegan but I love this place more than any restaurants, vegan or non. Every component is well thought out. The food is simply wonderful, plating and decoration is very good. There is some Mediterranean flare to the food and it is beautiful to look at. The chef is very innovative and the service is amazing! The best place ever! Ps.For some negative people who complain about noise absorbers and seat cushion should bring your own pillow and ear plugs with you and your own bubble so you can be separated from the world and no one will bother you, it's funny you didn't complain about the food because we all know the food is amazing. 5 star for everything",5 star rating,Mari A.

12/21/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","For some reason Santa Barbara just doesn't have a good vegetarian/vegan restaurant scene. I was really excited when Mesa Verde opened, and hoped they could help fill this gap. We have eaten here three times now, and sadly there won't be a fourth visit. The overriding tastes of the meals we've had here are bitter and salty. I could get over the fact that prices are fairly high for how small the portions are, but when the food just doesn't taste very good that is a hard thing to excuse. Each time we ate there we ordered a lot of plates just so we could leave feeling full, and really there was no dish that I loved. Most were decent, and some left a lot to be desired. My boyfriend is vegan and I'm about 70% vegetarian, so its not like we are people who aren't into vegetables and grains. I've worked enough service jobs to cut people a lot of slack when I eat out, but frankly the last time we were here the service sucked. I'm not an eater that needs to be coddled, but having my water glass refilled once in an hour period would have been nice. I had to physically get up and interrupt waitstaff chatting in the kitchen to ask for more. We definitely have encountered a couple friendly people who work here, but  there is a young and pretentious vibe that was off-putting to this 30 year old.It makes me sad to write this, as SB really needs a decent sit-down, vegetarian/vegan-friendly spot.  I don't think this is it.",2 star rating,Meredith L.

8/29/2015,"Miami, FL","I'd call it a vegan's paradise. The whole menu is totally Vegan. We ordered 2 main courses and were amazed by presentation, if you may call it so. Very tasty food served on nice plates/bowls. Unusual spices, sauces and ingredients satisfied our taste buds. A whole bunch of fresh juices and wines that he haven't tried yet. Did I say that the host and server were incredibly polite and attentive? Yes they were. Very sweet baklava desert with sour-ish molasses sauce and espresso wrapped up our dinner nicely. There were real candles on table. Setting was i'd say intimate. Great for a romantic date. And hey. Price on the check was absurdly low for such experience. Greatly recommend",5 star rating,andrii v.

3/16/2015,"Escondido, CA","Incredible food that is unique and expertly crafted. As soon as we sat down we were impressed, excited and intimidated. I can't remember our waiters name for the life of me, but he was a handsome young blonde man who answered all of our many questions about the menu, gave us some excellent recommendations and helped us narrow down our choices. To start off we ordered the polenta fries which we then descended upon like a pack of wolves. The fries themselves were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The toppings were so flavorful that we wanted to fight over the rights to abandon our dignity and lick the plate. The toppings were a red sauce, a pesto-like green sauce, some white beans, pumpkin and jalapeños from what I could tell. They all combined just amazingly for a really satisfying starter. The entree I ordered was the Cauliflower and Chorizo, which was one of our waiters recommendations and I'm so glad I took it because it was so delicious. Perfectly seasoned and not one bit of soy! The cauliflower was just a little crispy on the outside and went with the chorizo perfectly. It was also served with a bit of hummus that went with the whole mix very nicely. My coworkers ordered both taco varieties, the portobello tacos and the potato tacos. The portobello tacos were tasty, but a little too much barbecue taste for us...that being said there was no trace of them left when the meal was done. The potato tacos however were bomb! Two home made tortillas piled so high with goodness that we had to eat some out of it before we could pick it up. I would definitely keep this on mental file for another time. Lastly my 4th coworker ordered the pulled mushrooms...which tasted unbelievably close to pulled pork. Another one that made us wish it was socially acceptable to lick our plates clean. Wishing we had room for dessert we had to decline and head out. I can not wait to come back to this place. It's no where near where I live, but I am going to have to make a special trip here at some point. I was so impressed by this place. They have so many creative dishes, incredible sauces and the flavors go together so wonderfully. The chef is definitely very talented and I am looking forward to trying more of his creations in the future. I highly recommend you give this place a go...and take a lot of friends so you can try more things!",5 star rating,myia l.

12/31/2016,"San Diego, CA","The absolute best vegan restaurant I've ever visited. The food was out of this world! I had their special, a grilled (cashew) cheese, and my partner had their potato lattkes. When the food came out, I honestly felt like I should have been dressed nicer! The presentation of the food was all star quality. And of course, the recipes and quality ingredients shine through in each dish.Another reason why we had such a great experience: the owner of the restaurant came out and introduced himself, because I guess he didn't recognize us. And he made it a point to talk to us about the restaurant and how great it was to see new people come in.We heard about this place through word of mouth and in listings of SB restaurants, and it not only held up to its reputation but exceeded!!I will definitely be back here very soon and it will be one of my top recommendations for visitors to Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Jake K.

12/13/2015,"Placentia, CA","This place is so good! We were looking for ""delicious"" and ""Santa Barbara"" and found Mesa Verde. I was sold on the great reviews, seriously colorful photos, and the interesting ingredients. We went for Saturday brunch and got the falafel and Moroccan bowl (or something). Both were really yummy and light. Despite falafel being fried, I still felt clean inside, not heavy and saturated. Their hummus is to die for. The husband liked the flavors of his Moroccan bowl, too. The spices are strong but on point. He didn't love the veggie sausage, but he's too much of a carnivore to really appreciate a good meat alternative. The baklava has a tart element to it, which was new for me, but seriously preferable to the overly sugary baklava that I'm used to elsewhere.Lost a point for slightly high pricing but it was so good that a few bucks shouldn't stop you!",4 star rating,Elle C.
2/26/2017,"San Francisco, CA","Amazing vegan food. Baklava is a must! Potato latkas were exception and unique, however, the grilled ""cheese"" sandwich was average and I would skip that next time.

6/22/2017,"Saratoga Springs, NY","We loved this restaurant. One of us is a dedicated carnivore, and even he enjoyed the meal. To my taste, this is one of the best vegetarian restaurants I know. Each dish is distinctly seasoned, with careful conception of flavors, textures, and visual appeal. We were a large party and tried a lot of different dishes; none disappointed. The macro bowl sounded the least alluring and was one of my favorites. The restaurant serves many dishes that combine lentils or beans with other ingredients in creative and satisfying ways. Lentils were never overcooked; beans were soft or firm according to varieties and the dishes' needs.Service was excellent: attentive and friendly but not at all intrusive. We shared all the dishes and had to ask for serving spoons, which seemingly were in short supply.We don't live nearby--I wish they published a cookbook.",5 star rating,Sarah G.

I can't wait to come to Mesa Verde every time I come back to visit Santa Barbara. You need to eat here! Grilled cheese was so melty and creamy, but also light!

Decided it was worth it to get the car from the valet stand (even through I am right on State Street) and make the 10 minute drive here. So WORTH it. Best vegan/vegetarian food I have ever had! I live in Orange County and have tried many vegan/vegetarian places in OC, LA and San Diego and have traveled extensively and had the pleasure of eating at many vegetarian/vegan restaurants around the county in Seattle, Portland, Austin, Chicago etc. and this place is by far the best. I got the empanadas and the pulled smoked mushroom, which was like a deconstructed pulled pork sandwich. Both are good sized portions and very filling. I also tried the house made kombucha which was great as well. Can't wait to make another work trip here so I can visit again.

The Kale/nut burger was delicious with the bun being a flatbread, which was unique from the traditional buns you get. The orange accompanying sauce was an amazing burst of spicy flavor.

He mentioned that they have a new chef so we shared 2 entrées, an appetizer and a bowl of ""must have"" sweet potato chips. Great place but needs to work a little on the atmosphere.

8/26/2019,"Boyd, TX","One of the first restaurants to try in Santa Barbara and very happy. The waitress we had was very polite and was able to answer all of our questions and give recommendations that we all enjoyed. I tried Rose Water for the first time and really enjoyed how refreshing it was. All of drinks we ordered were light and refreshing. The strawberry cheesecake, cappuccino, and iced latte were our favorites of the evening. We are definitely looking forward to coming back another evening to sit outside and enjoy the food again. Of what we tried, we recommend the grilled cheese (cashew cheese--especially for kids), empanadas, and strawberry cheesecake. The pesto mushroom pizza was so-so. I think it might be because the pesto didn't have a lot of flavor which surprised us because I assume it's freshly made here. I find this restaurant a great place for people who want to see the different foods that can be made and be plant based. I do think it's a little high priced (2 empanadas, small pizza, grilled cheese sandwich, and a cheesecake slice) came to $104. I definitely understand that there is a lot of time put into the creation and preparation of these recipes however, I've been to equally good plant based restaurants for half the price but we will definitely be back once we saved up enough!",4 star rating,Lani B.

I tried the BLTA and picadillo empanada today. The ingredients they use are really fresh... The sauce for the empanada was flavorful and I liked the texture of the jackfruit chorizo. The tempeh bacon in the BLTA had a good crisp bite to it, and the avocado was great.We went for my wife's birthday with her parents, who normally eat meat. They enjoyed their meals too. Lots of gluten-free options as well. I'd definitely recommend Mesaverde for the thought they put into their food and service.",5 star rating,Greg F.

7/18/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Definitely was surprised to see this restaurant had opened up in my town without much talk about it, at least in my little circles. Had been meaning to go to this place when it first opened but drove by one day with my sister and saw it was finally open, so we decided to stop by and try it out! Wow, we were definitely surprised by their menu. They have such amazing smoothies, teas...just their drinks in general...and desserts. Though their menu was a little limited, it definitely was limited in the amount of flavor the food had. One thing common with vegan food is it's bland flavor, but this place is far from bland. It's delicious, and completely vegetarian! After ordering a black bean and kale burger and a smoothie, we also ordered lemon bars that tasted amazing! After eating, a man who I assume was the owner, came out and asked how everything was for us! Definitely a very delicious place with such friendly staff. The music playing was also very relaxing. Would and have recommend this place to my family and friends!  The only negative would be the prices, but considering it's organic and vegan in Santa Barbara, definitely still good!",5 star rating,Andrew H.
8/8/2015,"Sarasota, FL","A masterful argument for vegetarianism enacted. Complex, playful, and exceedingly creative. On a vacation passing through Santa Barbara we stopped in for one of the best dinners we have ever had, expecting Mesa Verde to be one of several restaurants tried before getting back onto the PCH heading north. As many offerings as the city has, Mesa Verde was so unique that we had to stop in again for Saturday brunch.The ambiance here is clean, chic, and eclectic industrial, the kind of setting that works for casual lunches or romantic dinners. The rich textures on the reclaimed wood ceilings and polished concrete floors set against the surrounding flower vines hints to what shows up on the plates we have had here- very dynamic contrasts chosen to balance one another between warmth and sharpness. The street tacos and black bean kale burger were both like having ordered several different tapas on one plate- many different flavors offered up to be combined many different ways on each forkful. There were so many little surprises like the extra acidity hidden within the pistachio dust on their baklava to the ingenious use of fried citrus with the black bean burger reminiscent of fried calamari. Every plate offered the additions of several small dusts or sauces to satisfy the novelty craving I think many foodies share, it makes playing look a little chaotic, but in the way that a good splatter painting makes you appreciate the order of randomness. Service was very attentive and portions were perfect for ordering app, dinner, and dessert without undue guilt. It is almost all vegan after all.",5 star rating,Jedediah S.

8/10/2014,"Sacramento, CA","Santa Barbara really lacks good vegan food so when I first heard about Mesa Verde opening up, I made a note was was able to visit them on opening week.The food is unique and delicious! Definitely unlike anything else I have tried. Some very interesting ingredient combinations, unique flowers and spices, which work really well together. You can definitely tell they have a very high-skilled chef working the kitchen. So far the falafel is my favorite!The service was excellent. We came with a large group on opening week and the servers were able to get our food out within a reasonable amount of time. All the servers were super friendly.They offer a few beers on tap which is nice but the beer comes in small mason jars. Weird but okay. They also offer a few beers in bottles and I think they offer wine too.The inside of the restaurant is all wooden which gives it a casual, laid-back vibe.The menus themselves were just pieces of paper written in ALL CAPS. I really hope that is not the final design as it takes about 3x longer to read. I would love some extra designations on the menu indicating different dietary restrictions, especially which items are vegan.The prices per item are average for Santa Barbara but the portions are on the small side. You may need to order an appetizer or side dish. With that said, it's so worth the price! I'm here salivating just thinking about it!",5 star rating,Christopher M.

7/13/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Ate dinner there last night.  The place has only been open a week, so that should be considered when reading this.  I am sure  a few of the kinks will be worked out in time.  We had the summer salad, which was an unusual mixture (for me at least) of fruit (including berries, watermelon) and vegetables (including heirloom tomatoes, arugula).  Interesting idea, but lacked an ""overall theme"".  Possibly some tweak in the dressing would pull it together.  I'll order it again in the future.  Also had the humus and fig flat bread.  The crust was surprisingly soft and doughy, which I really liked.  The toppings went well together, and I'll order it again.  Also had a glass of Pinot Grigio that was on tap, but the wine wasn't cool enough.  I'm sure they'll fix that in the future.  I had hoped this would be more of a cheap takeout kind of place, but it is a funky sit down place and the costs add up as you order separate salads, main courses and drinks.  The menu is in all caps (not optimal for readability) and each item has a description but not a name, which caused some confusion when ordering.  The restaurant had one soundtrack playing on its speakers, but the open kitchen had a different one playing, making it quite cacophonous if you were near the front of the restaurant and were forced to listen to both simultaneously.  We'll be back to try it again in the future.  I hope it is successful -- we need more healthy alternatives here in Santa Barbara.",3 star rating,Patrick M.

We've had one incredible server (who also works at Muni and is so friendly) and 3 really forgetful/intrusive/awkward servers. Taking dishes away AS my friend is eating from it, standing and staring awkwardly at the table without a clear purpose, asking how the food is as another server is literally placing the dishes in front of us...I don't really know what to say...we were just so confused.

The tempeh in the BLT did the trick providing a toothy kick of salt and smoke. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I didn't miss the bacon.  The plating tended toward the avant-garde, but worked. Soup was great, and the server was friendly and knowledgeable. I liked the three unsweetened iced tea options as well. Not the cheapest spot on the Mesa, but quite possibly the best.",5 star rating,James B.
7/15/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","My boyfriend and I tried Mesa Verde on Sunday evening. We have both been excited for it to open, since there are not many wholesome options on the Mesa for a tasty dinner. Neither of us are vegetarian, but we both like our share of veggies. The servers could brush up on their menu and ingredient knowledge, but most importantly, they were friendly. This made up for some of the lag in service and confusion about the menu. Mostly I wish that Mesa Verde was slightly more affordable. The portions seemed a bit small for the prices. The ingredients are fresh and delicious though. The mushroom tacos were great! Spicy and hearty. My boyfriend and I both loved them. The empanadas didn't do it for us like the tacos did. They were hyped so I expected them to be much tastier. They didn't actually have a crust like traditional empanadas (which I was looking forward to). Instead they were wrapped in corn tortillas that were pretty hard & difficult to cut through and chew. Seemed more like tacos with middle eastern flavors. Lastly, we ordered the caramelized onion & fig flatbread. This was an impulse order. My boyfriend saw it on the table next to us and had to have it. We added the cheese- if you are not vegan I highly recommend this. Oh my was this delicious! I was a little skeptical of the idea of hummus on a pizza like dish, but it totally worked. And the warm honey was scrumptious. We counted this as dessert. Overall, we had a great experience and are glad that Mesa Verde is so close to home. Our bill was over $50 with tip, and we didn't have any drinks. So this probably won't be a weekly spot, but we'll be back.",4 star rating,Betty E.

We walked I to the establishment and was greeted by a quaint yet sophisticated natural wood themed restaurant. The service was fast and the server was very friendly. I took a look at the menu and at first sight I immediately saw a few items that seemed interesting to me. Although I'm not a a vegetarian I do like humus, (WHICH I ORDERED), I also ordered an extra pita bread which had an beautiful assembly of herbs and spices. I also saw a very intriguing Umami burger, which my lover ordered and devoured! My lovers, beautiful friend ordered the Picadillo Empanadas, and was very pleased, especially with the Chimichurri that accompanied it.

The fez was the most unique / amazing thing I have eaten in a very, very long time.  Actually, everything had an amazing, rich flavor. The texture of the burger had to grow on me, but grow on me it did. The bread the burger comes on was simply heaven. Based on that, I'll have to come back and try the flatbreads sometime.Since price to quantity ratio often comes up in convos about Mesa Verde, I will weigh in. As someone who does not have 60 dollar post-tax/tip meals (for two) on a regular basis, I would recommend this restaurant for a date night. I would also recommend this place for tea and a snack on a more regular basis. If I am ever living a lifestyle of abundance and luxury, I would divide my meals evenly between this fine establishment, Bel Campo and noodle city.",5 star rating,Jane C.

They bent over backwards to accommodate my gluten free and IC, diet  restrictions The waiter offered me tastes of everything and to modify my meal to suit my restrictive dietary needs. Every morsel was amazing. The waiters were attentive but not obnoxious. I wish they would have a restaurant like this in Temecula.

8/24/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","For healthy, delicious food, Mesa Verde is an excellent choice.  The falafels are delicious, the rajas tacos are super tasty, and the salads are healthy and flavorful.  When they first opened I thought it was pricey for the amount of food, but the portions have gotten much bigger and it's a great value for organic food prepared with love and attention!  Unique flavors of Kombucha on tap, fresh pressed juice, plenty of vegetarian and vegan options that offer lots of flavor!",4 star rating,Tiare B.

As entrees, we had flat bread pizza, which was really good, a salad with warm peach and lentils, which was great. Someone in our party had the pasta special, which looked really good.

9/8/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I rode in on my bike after cycling for many, many miles. I was stinky, sweaty, and starving. It was a Friday afternoon and I arrived just before the rush. I sat outside and was quickly welcomed and assured that my bike was no trouble at all (I had it propped up next to my table). Since this was my first time eating here, the waitress was friendly and made a few recommendations. I ordered their gluten-free vegan lasagna and boy oh boy was it good! It tasted rich and creamy, with flavors that were not overpowering. As a vegan, I'm always skeptical of anything that tries to imitate the taste of cheese, but Mesa Verde absolutely mastered this art in a way that is subtle yet rich. The best part of my meal was the complimentary green juice that was given to me! A staff member very kindly said it was so I would stay hydrated while on my bike. Amazing service, amazing food - I will absolutely be back!",5 star rating,Cynthia C.

4/16/2015,"Los Angeles, CA","Flavorful and beautiful dishes! The best vegan food I've ever had. I've had brunch and dinner. For dinner, I had a bowl with grilled cabbage, white bean, quinoa, harissa, broccolini flowers, shishito peppers with tahini and chimichurri on the side. Sounds like a mess, right? NO! It was the most flavorful and satisfying bowl I've had in a long time. Every bite was a flavor explosion. We also had the Empanadas with black beans- crunchy, savory and delicious! I've also had the Picadillo tacos from the brunch menus. I loved this less than the other food I've had. Lots of spice and flavor, but a little messy and more heat than is my preference.There is no comparing the other vegan/vegetarian offerings at other restaurants to what you can enjoy here. They care about the food- its obvious. It's not just vegetables with a bunch of vegan sour cream, cheese and avocado. These meals are thoughtfully prepared with seasonal ingredients and are nutritionally complete. I said delicious too, right? We're from out of town so we can't come here often, but will definitely plan for a stop every time we're in town.",4 star rating,Suzanne K.

Having said that, Mesa Verde is one of the best where you forget it is even a vegan restaurant. The combination and contradiction of ingredients was thoughtful and splendid. We had the tacos and a side of the Brussel sprouts. The addition of ingredients like pickled onions and Fava bean purée make for delicious combinations and interesting combinations. We got into Santa Barbara late and got to the restaurant right at closing but the owner was generous enough to still prepare amazing takeout dishes for us and threw in a complimentary desert!  We didn't sit in but the restaurant ambiance (interior and exterior) is very intimate and warm. I would definitely go back next time I am in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Raj B.

As a vegan, any thoughtful vegan cuisine is a win so you can't really go wrong in my book.  There are a few items with eggs and milk and it makes for a bit of a mind-fuck. Lol. No offense but I'm allergic to dairy and eggs so I was a little fearful the whole meal. My problem I know,  but that's where a dedicated, All-in vegan menu is very comforting.

If your interested in a veggie experience, give this restaurant a shot. I'm not a vegetarian but I like to change it up now and then. They also had a large selection of fruity drinks. I'm definitely excited to try the drinks and dessert next time I'm in the area. The hummus was cool because it had a bunch of different spices and herbs along the perimeter so you could mix in or try them separately. The mushroom burger was huge.

6/14/2017,"Stamford, CT","This is my second review for Mesa Verde. We moved back east in March and came back to SB for a visit. We wanted to experience Mesa Verde again because there probably  isn't another restaurant like it anywhere in the country, and that says a lot. The food is totally unique, even the humus and flatbread, both being wonderfully seasoned with a combination of herbs of different flavors. It was easily enough for the three of us. My wife had a delicious risotto dish and I had their vegetable tacos that were magnificent. We also had two of the delicious California salads that were more than enough for all of us. Two pointers, be adventuresome because you can't tell what the dishes will taste like from reading the ingredients. You might also want to tell the server the order you'd like the food served otherwise you'll get it pretty much altogether in which case you can have a little of each dish and experience your food that way. All dishes except two are vegan and many gluten free. The menu is clearly marked. But please don't think of this restaurant as only for vegans and vegetarians (we are not either). It is for people who appreciate creative cooking at its very best, besides being very healthy.",5 star rating,Harold F.
11/22/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Tried Mesa Verde with some vegan friends visiting from out of town, and we were all totally impressed. Delicious, highly flavourful food that was hearty and satisfying without being too 'heavy' or rich, like some vegan restaurants. I especially liked the ambiance and decor - most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are super casual and basic, but Mesa Verde, while still casual, classes it up a notch or two, and makes for an inviting spot for a night out. My own constructive criticism is that most of our dishes came out at once, and weren't served in any regular dining order (ex. appetizers, then salads, etc). They warned us about this, but it was a bit overwhelming to get so much food at once, without any leisurely pacing to the meal.",5 star rating,Julia S.

Rajas Tacos with butternut nacho cheese, the California Salad is light and refreshing and full of flavor (loved the currants), I've also had the Piccadilly Empanadas which were savory and delicious, and love the Street taco with jackfruit chorizo! Everything here is full of flavor, unique, substantial, and you'd never know you were eating vegan food- just healthy, fresh, amazing ingredients.

The portions were so large that were nearly too full for our main courses.  No room at all for dessert so cannot comment on that.  I seriously hope that their continued success leads to a cookbook as we would love to bring this food home.,5 star rating,CA C.
12/30/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","To start we shared the scrumptious cheese plate with the gluten free crackers and it was absolutely delectable. I had the macro bowl --it tasted divine. My girlfriend had the delicious risotto and loved it, even though she isn't a vegan. Lastly we tried the Brûlée berry panacotta ( I believe that was the name) and the outer crispy crust juxtaposed with the creamy soft inside leaves me wanting more. We also tried the pumpkin cheesecake which is equally as delicious, although my partner preferred the berry panacotta. We only wish that they had a restaurant in Los Angeles. But if you are travelling through, don't pass by! The atmosphere is amazing! And the food is better than any vegan restaurant in Los Angeles. Believe me I've tried them all.",5 star rating,M H.

They're beautifully seasoned and spiced without being TOO spicy. Not to mention all the food looks gorgeous on the plate.

I called on a Wednesday to request a lunch reservation for Friday afternoon for five local women celebrating a special birthday. I was put on hold and then spoke to a gentleman who I believe is either a manager or owner. He said he could not except my reservation because they only do parties of 6 or more. I explained that I wanted a table in the quiet part of the restaurant and that I needed a reservation so I could come about a 20 min early to put down flowers and presents before coming back with my quests. He said he would not accommodate that request. I explained we were all new to his restaurant and asked if he would rather have us go somewhere else where I could secure a reservation. He said "" if you have not been here in the four years I've been open, then I do not want your business!"" Unbelievable.",1 star rating,Cindy H.

We're vegans from San Diego where there are definitely choice restaurants to eat at. This place is at the top of the list. We were in quick and our server with the purple hair was very hospitable as well as informative of the menu which was refreshing. The cheese plate was out of this world! Beer selection was smaller but managed to cover all the bases. A bit pricey but when you get your food you can see why. Definitely will make this a staple on our trips up the coast. Thank you!,5 star rating,Joe A.
1/6/2016,"East Bay, CA","Simply some of the best vegetarian and vegan food anywhere.Every so often you have a meal that satisfies you so much, you wonder how you survived before without it. This was one of those meals. Look - I know what many people think (wrongly): vegetarian food, or even ""worse"" - VEGAN food, has little flavor, and a depth of soul, without the inclusion of meat or dairy products. Well I challenge those people to go here, and try to say you were not pleasantly surprised. I have eaten vegetarian food for more than two decades (meaning I AM an authority, kids), and was vegan for almost a decade. I have eaten at some of the most praised, hallowed halls of this type of cuisine, all over the country, and can tell you what they are doing here, the approach, the core beliefs and philosophy - this is what it truly is all about. No meat, only dairy in a few select dishes, many are gluten-free, and all are extremely creative, being some of the most eclectic dishes I have ever read off a menu. I couldn't even envision what they were going look like, as the descriptions were poetic verses, not prose, which mentioned 10-12 ingredients in every dish. And when the dishes arrived, they were pieces of artwork. Too many people today take photos of mediocre food - average burgers, or other uninteresting fare. I captured images worthy of being framed and put on a wall. When the chef (who created the vision), along with the entire, hardworking, kitchen team that helps executes them to perfection, takes this much pride in what they do, it shows. The food here is simply perfection, and though everyone would enjoy a meal here, the ones who would definitely appreciate it the most, are those who have eaten vegetarian fare for a long time, through thick and thin, through good and bad, just hoping to one day reach the apex of what this cuisine can be. Well rejoice, as your time has finally come.With so many different influences and techniques present, and so many interesting food choices, this place is so much more than just brown rice and veggies. Be tantalized by flavors you likely have never had in these combinations. And the decor is marvelous as well. The all wooden interior derives greatness from its own simplicity, emanating a warmth that feels like a friend or family member's home, or getaway. And with, yes, the cool-guy host, PR man, and friend of seemingly everyone, Jamal, who goes from table to table, greeting families and babies he hasn't seen in a long time, you just can't help but feel that everything here is genuine. He is not acting this way, as so many hosts elsewhere do. He genuinely enjoys his role, and it shows, as the people receive him equally as well.And lest me not forget my waiter Beau, as I deferred to him on my selections, being too overwhelmed from all the terrific offerings, and not knowing what to order (and I'm sure all the other waiters too have great knowledge of the food choices as well). He shied me away from my initial choices, and recommended some of his favorite dishes, and they both were incredible. Fried Brussels sprouts with onion slivers, pumpkin seeds, and capers, atop a fava bean puree was the special to start. And the main dish was reminiscent of pulled pork BBQ (not meat, but the spice and subtle, smokey flavor) - I'll just give you the way it reads from the menu: PULLED SMOKED MUSHROOM. PICADILLO. CARMELIZED ONION. GRILLED FLATBREAD. SWEET POTATO CRISPS. CORNICHON. PICKLED TURNIP. HARISSA. DIJON. DRIED JALAPENO POWDER. PINK LADY APPLE. The only suggestion I have is to enhance this description is to explicitly list TEMPEH, as it was omitted, but present in the dish, had a great flavor and texture, and this is a big selling point, for the well versed vegetarian. Tempeh is one of the best sources of protein, having been around for several hundred years. And I got to top it off with vegetarian baklava with vegan ice cream - and on the house no less, as I had already complimented both the waiter and host after only trying the appetizer. A classy move that was appreciated, but certainly not necessary.I could go on and on, but then you would never finish this review. Hopefully I created enough interest for you to want to go eat here for yourself. You MUST go eat here, vegetarian and meat-eater alike. Not far off the freeway, and far both the college and downtown madness, this place is a culinary oasis you must sip from. The other advice I have for the owners, the chef, and all the supporting kitchen, wait, and bus staff: keep doing what you are doing, continuing to push the bounds of what people traditionally think of as vegetarian food, and never lose your sense of whimsy, appreciation of food as art, and desire to be original, while setting yourself apart from the fray. I will eat here again, and again, and again, and plan to work my way through the entire menu. Thank you for the insurmountable first impression. People will be hard pressed to find better vegetarian food here or abroad.",5 star rating,Sal G.

8/20/2017,"Anaheim, CA","This place has horrible service. We got there at 8, they said they closed at 9 and said that they couldn't seat us because it was busy. Then we asked if we could wait and they said no because they had ""too many people waiting"" when there were only two parties in front of us. Most places don't turn guest down an hour before they close. This is stupid. They might as well close at 8 pm.

8/1/2016,"Claremont, CA","Delicious! And great service! It's vegetarian, but you hardly miss the meat. I ordered the pulled mushroom sandwich to eat on the Amtrak to go back to San Diego. It doesn't taste like pulled pork but still very tasty and flavorful! The slaw that it comes with really cuts through the rich flavor of the mushroom. At the restaurant, since we had a couple of hours to kill, we ordered the polenta fries. Definitely order that if you at there. I also ordered the rose lemonade. Pretty good. The manager/owner? gave us some pressed beet, orange, and turmeric juice to try. It was very good. Will try some other pressed juices next time. He also heard that we wanted to get some baklava to go but couldn't get it with the ice cream due to the train. He insisted that we must have baklava with the ice cream so he gave us a free order!

3/1/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","So, found this place via Yelp while on a road trip. I was taking food to go and wanted something healthy and filling. I had no idea what to eat so the man working the register was full of suggestions in different categories: we settled on a sausage pizza with ricotta I wanted a little more green, asked for a side salad, and instead got a full colorful entree salad, and it was on the house!! Not only was my 'side of greens' order free, it was seriously upgraded and the veggies were super fresh. While waiting for my pizza, he gave me a cup of freshly made juice and it was sooo yums. Wasn't waiting long either. Wish I lived closer!!",5 star rating,Sierra P.
4/17/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Wow!!!! Wow!!! Wow!! My lady and I were up from LA for a hike and wanted to go somewhere vegetarian. I'm a die hard carnivore and she's a die hard veggie. I googled ""best vegan restaurants in Santa Barbara"" because I figured we would find some good ones here (and that would earn me some brownie points ). The first one that came up was the vegetarian restaurant Mesa Verde. Omg words can't describe how delicious, fresh and well prepared this food was. I had the burger made with mushrooms and root vegetables. And she had the faro bowl. I also had the roibos iced tea. Everything was made from scratch. Including the almond milk she had in her latte. We recommend this place 1000%. The service is fantastic and the owner came by and greeted us personally. If you want healthy and delicious and are in the mood for vegetarian, go!

10/16/2017,"Barstow, CA",Well my kid has gone Vegan on me so she found this place for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. Had 4 dishes and a dessert. The dessert was the most disappointing. It was their take on panna cotta and it fell short. Good attempt but totally missed the mark. Their best dish was their take on charcuterie. I would do that again in a heartbeat. All in all a nice evening with nice service. Will go again but need a steak place first.,4 star rating,b r.

10/4/2016,"Coronado, CA","Incredible. We found this place here on Yelp before we came to SB for a quick trip and it was worth it. The Empanadas were insanely good. Crispy crust, tasty filling, and excellent chimichurri. Also had the polenta fries and patatas tacos which we're both very good. We were stuffed but still ordered a cheesecake to go. The owner stopped by our table to check on our experience and after talking with us for a while hooked us up with what was the most delicious baklava I've ever had. Absolutely delicious and there was some kind of lemon drizzle on it that was so good. Definitely will stop back in next time we're in SB.",5 star rating,Andy V.

The staff and family are terrific, caring people who have a passion for their restaurant which is worth a star and a half. The menu items see to be hit or miss, however. I love the ""fake cheese board"" at dinner (so bummed it wasn't on the lunch menu). The polenta fries were So greasy they had to be worse than eating regular fries. My empanadas were spicy hot but without much flavor. The corn wrap was dry. Beans seemed a by undercooked and also without much flavor.The Hub loved his vegan BLT. Why are half the items so bland? Salt is vegan, right?",3 star rating,East West Coast Girl C.

3/24/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","This restaurant is the absolute BEST!!! The food is incredible! outstanding! makes you want to pull a Tom Cruise and jump on a couch during Oprah's talk show- kind of incredible. The price is right and the owner is on another level of providing outstanding customer service. When we finished paying the bill and he found out it was our tables first time eat at this restaurant, he insisted we wait for him to bring us some complimentary Baklava (the best dessert on the menu. You NEED to try it). That kind gesture from the owner is one of the main reasons we have been coming back about once a week since then. If you are lucky enough the get the smiley server who doesn't write down your order, you are in for a treat. He is very friendly and approachable, honest about his opinions on certain menu items, engages in conversation where you don't feel like another one of their tables, and he has never gotten an order wrong from anyone at my table! Props to you and your wicked memory, sir. All in all, this is a heavenly little establishment and you need to get all up in it. Support our local businesses!

They are annoying hipsters who shouldn't all have beards if they work in a restaurant. My girlfriend and I paid $80 for 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine and we split 1 entree.

3/22/2018,"Oakley, CA","The food is instagram friendly, healthy, and vegetarian! We ate here during our visit to Santa Barbara and it was a little confusing at first when we stepped in. There wasn't anyone in the front and  no sign to indicate you seat yourself, so we were standing awkwardly for two minute or so until someone in the kitchen kindly and happily informed us to find our own seats and someone will be with us. There is so much to choose from in the menu!! I felt like the menu could be better categorized in appetizers vs mains, since they were all bunched in one page. I was confused which items were smaller portions and meant for sharing, versus items that were well portioned and meant for one. In the end I got the empanadas, and my boyfriend got the burger. Both dishes were yummy and portions were filling, and they looked beautiful. We also shared a smoothie, which was the only thing I regretted to get since it was incredibly small and did not have the taste to match the price. The building and ambiance are beautiful and I would visit again with health conscious friends if I'm ever in the area again.",4 star rating,The T.

The Artemis is awesome!!! We had three each- the opener gave us a free juice tasting & seemed to really care. My grind was just out of hospital so she didn't eat all of her plate but took it home to eat later.

I know I should try something new, but street tacos keep calling me. My wife loves portobellos, so she did the mushroom tacos. Jackfruit is the unsung hero of the vegetable world -- how does that spiky melon manage to mimic the texture of pulled pork? But the Mesa Verde street tacos are so much more -- thick homemade corn tortillas, sweet tomato relish, roasted jalapenos. All this and vegan dessert too -- baklava and ice cream, a sprinkling of ground pistachios and a sweet-sour syrup, I think it was pomegranite. Wow, thanks again Mesa Verde!",5 star rating,Steve K.
6/3/2016,"CA, CA","Favorite vegetarian restaurant.If your unsure if the flavor combo will work  (or haven't heard of an ingredient or two) when read a menu item here its more the reason to try it. The flavors change throughout the dish and and even during each bite and combine very well during this process. I've eaten most everything on the menu and dug it all. One of the things that separates this place from most other is that I never feel I need to add anything, be it salt, hot sauce....  The ingredients taste, smell, and look great.  A  must try whenever your in Santa Barbara.",5 star rating,Rob C.

1/2/2017,"Vancouver, Canada","Started off bad by ended up so good I will definitely come back again. Firstly - great menu and really good quality of food and prices are reasonable. I think a lot of the items are organically sourced, and I'm vegan so the menu was awesome for me. My friend is not vegan and was happy for me to choose the dished and we shared -something I can never do in a conventional restaurant. We had potatas bravas and it was tasty and well presented. We also shared the BLAT and that was really good to - I liked the bun it was served on and even though we didn't need more food, I wanted to try the baclava. First thing my friend said was ""that's really good ice-cream"" and it was soy ice-cream and really delicious and the baclava was heavenly.So 10/10 for the food. Ordered chai tea and it was very strong and got cold quickly. The only reason it started out bad was we were totally ignored on arrival. It was busy - 1.50pm and 3 parties in front of us waiting. We stood for 10 minutes (yes, I timed it) and did not get acknowledged once. No smile, no eye contact, no explanation - just left to stand while we waited for the staff to clear tables and get people seated. I watched 3 tables get seated - not one was given a menu until another few minutes had passed. So not only do you stand and wait patiently, you have to wait again for a server to come and give you a menu - surely that could have been done so at least you are sitting and have something to do. It was 2.10 before we were seated with a menu in front of us. That's a long time to wait. Anyway - the food was great and the service was ok. That's better than the other way around.",4 star rating,Jacqui B.

But-bonus for me- I am a meat eater and my partner is veg, so it's great to go somewhere she can eat everything. In particular, the Brussels sprouts were AMAZING, the hummus and baklava were maybe the best I've ever had, and the cashew cheese was fabulous. This isn't a place that tries to imitate meat and cheese, but does its own thing. We will definitely be back. Also great service, and the owner was very welcoming.",5 star rating,c d.

We'd also ordered the Moroccan Fez which we did not enjoy very much--the couscous and the pomegranate didn't work for us. A shared plate and one main should do the trick. The waitress recommended 3 dishes for 2 people but it was too much for us. We were almost out the door when the owner /manager called us back in for some dessert. He provided us with a complimentary cheesecake,  easily the best vegan cheesecake we've had.",5 star rating,Siddarth S.

The mushroom umami burger, pulled mushroom burger, and jackfruit tacos were all fantastic. To top it off, we were surprised with some complimentary baklava with ice cream.

5/19/2016,"Rosemead, CA","We took a spontaneous day trip from Los Angeles up to Santa Barbara. We were looking for a place to grab a meal and Mesa Verde popped up as one of the top options through searching vegan on yelp. The images other reviewers posted looked promising and Mesa Verde definitely did not disappoint. My girlfriend and I agreed this was the best vegan/vegetarian restaurant we've had the chance to experience.We've tried numerous places in LA (Crossroads, Shojin, Cafe Gratitude,  Gracias Madre, etc. etc.) We both felt none of these places could match Mesa Verde on ingredient selection/quality or execution/presentation. Very much life changing :)Service was great and the environment is very welcoming and warm. Has a modern and casual vibe to it, simple and clean. Great for a date or just a meal with friends/family. Outdoor seating with heaters available.We had an appetizer on special, the rajas tacos, pulled smoked mushrooms, and baklava desert. All amazing. Works of art on plates with great flavors to match. Prices are super reasonable.We were already planning on a trip back before we had finished our meal there. If you were to include Mesa Verde on top of a day of hiking/beach going, it makes for the perfect little quick escape.",5 star rating,Steve Y.

7/24/2017,"Vista, CA","Mesa Verde seemed impressive the first time I came. The vegan tacos and deserts are awesome. And it is obvious the management takes great pride in the establishment. The second time was a disaster. My problem is with the waitress Hilary who did not specify that there were things on the menu that were not all plant based. After ordering and eating the pricey lasagna (for the price I figured oh its the fancy house made nut cheeses), I overheard her telling the other table when they asked that no, it is not all vegan. I was mortified and started sweating profusely and immediately went to ask the front of the house who confirmed this. When the snide, pretentious Hilary asked how everything was, I told her. She didn't apologize or seem remorseful at all!! Instead she lied in front of all of us saying she told us before we ordered which was not true. No one at our table was told this. Very dangerous for those with serious milk allergies. I am so disappointed that it is not an all vegan establishment, as it seems their chefs are good enough to be up to the challenge. Nut cheeses could be used in all the dishes rather than some stolen, pus infected, tortured blood-milk. No need for customers to pay for that kind of cruelty to cows and their babies. It's not like the cows are naturally always pregnant, or that the mothers or their babies are nurtured and freed after the indentured milk and veal slavery. I won't be back here until they actually turn all plant-based and I don't have to risk service from this type of person. They didn't even offer to take it off the bill, so yeah, I am deeply saddened to say my money went toward animal abuse and murder that day and to a restaurant who encourages that.",2 star rating,Tess R.

12/9/2016,"Silver Spring, MD",Ugh. So so good. Me and my partner were visiting SB for the day and I'm always interested in finding the best vegan food whenever I travel. So I went to Google and it led me here. The tacos were so packed and filled with love. The empanadas were on point. The smoothie was overflowing with kindness and desert (house made baklava and ice cream) was on the house by the owner since we were first timers. DONT MISS THIS SPOT. MUST GO. SO LOVE.

8/7/2014,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland","We eat here all the time. It is literally the best place you could possibly go in Santa Barbara for fresh eats. If you support the local food movement, eat vegan or raw, then you should be here. My kid loves the pizza. If you love Pizza Hut, Norms, or Olive Garden, you can pass over this place. Small potions work for raw and vegan foodies because they are nutrient dense, and plant-based. It's challenging to understand this way of eating compared to the way Americans are used to eating. I'm an American. I was raised on McDonalds. I get it. The portions are small and the sodium is lacking. The lab-made Monsanto engineered glyphosate was not present in the ketchup. That could be a problem. But I think not. When you get food of better quality, organic, and chemical free, expect to pay a little more! Most of the calories that piled on a plate at Olive Garden for example? Empty or even harmful. Let's not even talk about the sodium content. Good vibes. Local food. I love it.",5 star rating,Frances A.

This restaurant was recommended to us by our nutritionist and chiropractor. It exceeds expectations. I love the salads, mushroom ""burgers"" and veggie platters. Great use of spices, food combinations, and presentation. Wish I could do vegetarian like this at home. If you want great smoothies; gluten free, and vegan options full of taste, this is 5 stars. I can't wait to try some of the salads (which I haven't tried), and when I can-the polenta fries. When I am done with my detox and cleanse, definitely trying the desserts. Jamal-the owner is great!

We have tried few other popular vegetarian places in Orange County. However, they don't even come close to this place. We tried Rajaa tacos, grilled flat bread and fancy grilled corn.

3/5/2017,"Los Angeles, CA","After you dine at Mesa Verde everything you eat will taste mediocre in comparison. We stopped here on our way back to LA and were blown away with everything we ordered off the brunch menu (latkes, tacos, and empanadas). If you're vegan, this restaurant is a MUST. If you have non vegan friends who like to whine about how vegan food lacks flavor and substance, this restaurant is also a must. And while you're here, do yourself a huge solid and order the baklava even if you're too full from ordering multiple entrees for yourself like I was. You can make room for a dessert that I can only imagine is what is served in Heaven.",5 star rating,Jessie H.

We arrived when the restaurant opened, so the service was relaxed and attentive and the owner was just lovely.  We ordered way too much, too excited about the options to narrow our choices, but enjoyed the leftovers.  Everything that we had was delicious, beautifully presented - and the portions were substantial.  We had the Latkes, BLTA and Macro Bowl (plus chai and lemonade).  Admittedly, though we were stuffed (and had leftovers already boxed to go), we gave into the offer of baklava with vanilla ice cream and were blown away.  Insanely good.  Don't miss Mesa Verde, especially if you are even remotely interested in seeing how good plant based food can be...",5 star rating,Mara S.

6/30/2016,"San Francisco, CA","Oh man, this place was beyond amazing. The service was super friendly, with multiple people checking in with us throughout the meal. What we ordered: - Flatbread and hummus - really tasty, loved the flower/herb concoction that topped the hummus- Polenta fries - the fries were perfectly crispy and the bean/olive/squash combo heightened the flavors immensely- Street tacos - do NOT leave this place without trying these - the jackfruit ""chorizo"" is so good, I wish more chefs used jackfruit in vegan/vegetarian dishes- Baklava - yummm :) the baklava was light, crispy, and the perfect sweetness level, the pomegranate molasses provided a tart counterpoint and who doesn't love ice cream with dessert - They also gave us a small piece of the vegan strawberry cheesecake to try (super sweet of them!) and it was surprisingly good, but I have to say nothing compares to the baklava.

4/28/2017,"San Luis Obispo, CA","My oldest and dearest friends were raving about Mesa Verde and when we went to Santa Barbara for the weekend we decided to go there. My friend is a vegetarian and has ben for 46 years. I always trust his judgement on  vegetarian restaurants as I am not a vegetarian , he was salivating when he was describing what he and his wife my BFF had when they went there before, pulled smoked mushroom sandwich, the Raja's Tacos and the polenta fries. so Maureen and I get their first and Blair drove up from the valley to meet us, and none of those items are served for lunch Sat or Sunday. This was devastating to all of us, we ordered off the brunch menu but nothing was very good my mushroom burger was probably the best of their items it is was just so so. they each got one of the bowls, can't even remember which ones. they were terrible. Now tell me why you would not have your most delicious food on the weekend? I will never go back. bad decisions on Managers or owners part.",1 star rating,Beverly D.
10/6/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Chef is from Los Angeles. He definitely brings something new to the Santa Barbara food scene with this vegetarian spot. Every dish is artfully composed with fresh ingredients and inventive use of herbs not seen on other menus in SB (za'tar, tarator, sumac). Most recently I had the summer empanadas which came in a terrific corn exterior that was crispy and held up to the vegetables and (hummus?) inside. Served with well seasoned beans and an interesting sauce. The grilled peach salad was also good with a blueberry chipotle salsa and fresh pea shoots (peaches were a little under ripe). Chef has a solid understanding of flavor without using butter as a crutch.  Definitely nothing like it in SB and worth heading out to the Mesa to try.  Wines by the glass need work.",4 star rating,Claire C.

Either way the flavors are intense, in my opinion to much so. If something looks spicy be prepared for very spicy, I have had items way too salty and some of the items are really just too sweet. It's hit or miss here on flavor but they always deliver high quality ingredients and good service.

We are both full-time vegans, and are often left disappointed when we venture out to eat rather than cooking for ourselves at home. Such was NOT the case at Mesa Verde. We shared the Street Tacos, the California Salad, two Americanos (complimented by a dash of homemade almond milk-YUM!) and finished off our meal with a DELIGHTFUL piece of baklava which the owner brought for us to enjoy (on the house)! Everything was DELISH! My boyfriend is newly vegan and was so impressed by the combinations of flavor and texture this restaurant was able to achieve.

2/15/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA",We went here with high expectations and were sorely disappointed. We both love plant based foods but were unhappy with what we were presented with. The food is very spicy and too flavorful. In addition there are not that many options to choose from if you dislike spicy food so it's not a very easy menu to choose from. The service was subpar and we had to wait over 15 minutes for water. The waitress was somewhat flat and disengaged in helping us. The ambiance is ok but your view is the parking lot so not that great. The only thing I loved was their chai tea which takes a while to brew but is delicious. I wouldn't suggest a meal here but just drinks.,3 star rating,Pantea R.

The tortillas are home-made and all their veggies are super fresh. All their flavors are unique and oh-so-tasty! They do a great job at making healthy taste good. My husband usually always eats meat but he was satisfied after trying some of their hearty mushroom options. They also offer kombucha which is great if you aren't drinking but still want to enjoy something with dinner. The owner is the sweetest as well.

Great customer service -- was periodically enquired by multiple folks on whether I needed anything else. Excellent ambience -- the outside seating and the surrounding atmosphere makes it a great place to wind down after a tiring day at work. Quality dishes --  I had the Moroccon tagine and it was spicy, flavorful and exceptional. The caramelized onions on top was a nice touchHuge portion sizes -- there is a lot of food for one person and the ingredients felt fresh. Last but not the least, after knowing that I was a traveller and visited the place based on yelp reviews, Jamal (the owner probably) served me a baklava with ice cream and cherry sauce (on the house).

You simply won't make it to the movie in time.The plates are brought out when ready -- so if you're sitting with 6 friends and you want to eat together -- you might have the pleasure of watching one of your friends eat before any of the others are served. Fun for that friend too.The dishes tend toward too spicy -- they over-harissa everything -- So I always ask if they will leave that out of anything. There will still be enough spice in your meal for flavor.The food is fresh, beautiful and delicious over all.  The plating is gorgeous - a work of art -- I do recommend going. I would bring friends here. But I adjust my expectations based upon my experience there.",3 star rating,surya c.
9/10/2015,"New York, NY","The food is pretty and innovative. The staff is great and very helpful. I would say that the highs are high, but the lows are low. Last time, we got a potato and cauliflower dish and it was completely covered in sauce. It was goopy, powdery, and gummy. Like if I poured chipotle/adobo powder and mixed it with water and pretended that was an edible sauce. Or how the latkes were thick and soggy. But, then the burger comes and it's accompanied by the tastiest flatbread. Or the falafel arrives and it's off the hook yummy. I will continue to come here when in SB, but order with caution. Unfortunately, presentation sometimes exceeds taste here. I would say it's more of a 3.5 star place.",3 star rating,G L.

1/11/2018,"Santa Barbara, CA","I went to Mesa Verde a few weeks ago after hearing great things from various friends. The staff was very friendly and attentive and the wood details of the restaurant was rustic and beautiful. We ordered the hummus appetizer and the quinoa burger with cashew cheese. The burger was ok and came with a green salad. The cashew cheese was good but the entire sandwich lacked defined flavor and was definitely not anything extraordinary. The hummus could have been much more flavorful as well. I was bummed out given the reputation atmosphere and the price,  I really wanted to love it! Definitely surprised to not be totally blown away by the food because of all of the raving reviews I had heard previously. I am still glad to have a healthier vegan choice in town and am curious to know where they source there produce from? Given the price, I would hope they are supporting local CSA's and business. If you want a yummy healthy/veggie meal in the area save your money and go to lazy acres nearby and have a picnic on the beach! Definitely was disappointed with the food, not because it was bad but because it was not anything out of the ordinary for a pricey lunch, it's possible I could have just ordered the wrong thing!Unfortunately, the experience did not meet my expectations, I would love to hear back from Mesa Verde on how they recover from unsatisfied customers such as myself.

6/28/2016,"Santa Barbara, CA","I wanted to try this place after a rave review from a good friend and he didn't even mention that this place is vegetarian/vegan. I went for the first time with another good friend - a hardcore carnivore. We ordered 3  items between us and each plate was both brilliantly presented and absolutely delicious. While I normally eat a vegetarian/vegan diet, I was not only satisfied, but absolutely amazed at the attention to flavor and texture that these dishes provided. Many vegetarian restaurants tend to be bland and boring. Not the case here! My friend said that the meal opened his mind to the possibility of 'good vegetarian food'. He didn't miss not having meat/dairy one bit. We both agreed that the pulled mushroom sandwich was dynamite!We did go a bit overboard with our ordering as each plate was a good portion and we also got beers and deserts. While this meal was a bit spendy at around $90. I think even a hungry couple could get away for under $50 after tax/tip.The service was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere on the patio was also very nice.",5 star rating,Miles G.

The owner is super friendly and checks on all of his diners.  He also inspects all of his food daily to assure quality and freshness. The food here is really different from other vegan restaurants as they don't use the traditional things like tofu. We got the hummus and flatbread, the grilled cheese and the falafel sandwich. The hummus was really good and the flatbread was made fresh so it was really warm and soft. It was the best hummus I've ever had I will be back just for the hummus and flatbread. The grilled cheese was also great. The bread was nicely toasted and the poblanos really added great flavor. The portions were pretty big and three dishes for the two of us were way too much.

1/15/2017,"San Diego, CA","Mesa Verde has amazing customer service-it's fast, waiters are nice and the owner spoke to us. Our friend had been there before and brought us all there and for that we got complimentary baklava, which I haven't had in 2 years because it's not that popular nor is it always vegan! I was so excited and it tasted amazing and so did the ice cream! The Flatbread with hummus is amazing as well- the bread is so soft and herby, while the hummus is obviously not just store bought. I had the macro bowl and as a college student I never make such intricate fancy bowls so, I was a bit scared at first, especially since it looked so unique. Mixing everything together made a great mix of tastes and I loved it, especially the tempeh bacon that tastes very bacon-y. I really want to try the grilled cheese. Be prepared to spend a bit of money here, for not huge, but filling unique portions. Parking is very limited and we had to park across the street in the Plaza so beware of that too, but it's worth it. Good date spot if you want to try new things with a pretty aesthetically pleasing restaurant.",5 star rating,Riley A.

While I appreciate the quality service AND the complementary mini glass of wine they served us, that alone wouldn't have been enough for me to write a 5-star review. The food was truly amazing. We ate A LOT--the market salad, mushroom tacos, roasted baby carrots, and the fig and carmalized onion flatbread. Every dish exceeded my expectations.

11/23/2015,"Oakland, CA","The presentation was gorgeous, like what you would see in a fancy restaurant (but also hearty portions). Anyone who thinks vegetables are boring or thinks of overcooked pasta and soggy veggies as vegetarian food will have their mind blown by the complexity of flavors and textures.Everything was delicious, but our favorite was definitely the Macadamia Crostini. The ""pulled mushroom"" dish was filling and savory in all the right ways. The empanada was good but not as unusual as the other dishes (though not much like an empanada, exactly).Fancy juice (Persephone) was incredible, and the $10 (!) juice is really $8 because of the bottle deposit, and it's plenty for two to share.We'll be back for dessert - too full on this visit. p.s. nice outdoor patio with heat lamps",5 star rating,Joshua F.

Service = one of the best servers in Santa Barbara. Owner/Host = extremely gracious and appreciative of our patronage. Try it out. You won't be disappointed.,4 star rating,Lucas C.
4/4/2017,"Lakewood, CA",This is THE BEST Vegan restaurant I have ever been to. One of my friends is strictly Vegan and it is almost impossible to find good choices for her to eat whenever we go out. I am the opposite I love all things meat and cheese yet i enjoyed every meal I have ever had at this restaurant. All the servers and workers are wonderfully friendly not to mention the owner. He is the sweetest and most attentive host. The desserts are also pretty amazing,5 star rating,Bianca B.

But our waitress Gwen was attentive and pleasant and the food came surprisingly fast. The new owner Jamal made the rounds and welcomed everybody. We saw all of our friends there and felt at home immediately. The menu is unique imaginative and very interesting. The food was delicious tasty and intriguing.

The flat bread was perfect.  The patty was covered with greens and some deep fried lemon wedges were served on the side.  I also had the herbal coffee.

All I can say is that I am so glad we sat because we ended up having a three course meal (chai, cold pressed juice, roasted brussel sprouts, street tacos, chocolate tart and baklava) and had to be rolled out of there (not literally)!!!The food is absolutely scrumptious (full on party in my mouth), the decor is lovely with great service - everyone was so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. And the cold pressed carrot and strawberry juice we had was off the chain.BUT to top it all off they had the most incredible vegan and gluten free chocolate tart with almond milk foam and cranberry sauce or some delish sauce on the top.

7/17/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, so I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. I must say that I was PLEASANTLY surprised. I went to dinner with my partner, and we treated the meal as a shared dish concept. We started with the Grilled Flatbread w/ Hummus. The Hummus was nicely textured, and the flatbread and hummus were perfectly seasoned with za'atar, delicious! Then we had the Cochinita Pibil Portobello Tacos - which were substantial and very filling, along with a great flavor profile. We ended with the Moroccan Fez, which was OKAY, I wouldn't get it again primarily because I think the first two dishes set our expectations by being very well seasoned and delicious, and this dish fell flat, but was still good. We will definitely be returning to explore the rest of the menu - great new find for us in Santa Barbara!",5 star rating,Zach P.

Our server, Anthony, was outstanding; he was very personable and had a soothing aura that took our dining experience to the next level! Ask for him if you go! The food was fantastic as well. After eating vegan all week in LA this was my favorite meal we had ! We shared all of our entrees (5 of us) and everything was really good. My favorite was the pulled mushroom sandwich! After expressing to the owner how much we enjoyed our meal he sent out a vegan baklava to the table on the house. It was so good we decided to try the chocolate cake as well.

We ordered the flatbread, pizza with caramelized onions, mushroom tacos, summer salad, falafel (was a special), something with lentils and hummus that was yummy and a lemon tart. All of these dishes were executed with style and were very tasty.The service was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.We eat a mostly plant based diet and are always looking for restaurants that ""get it"". Mesa Verde gets it! My only criticism is that the portions are a bit small for the price. You are on the Mesa...not the Funk Zone, not Montecito, not LA... My opinion is that you'll need to either lower your prices or increase the portion size (particularly for your salads) to achieve success at your location.I'm a fan and will support you!",4 star rating,Jerrad B.
8/6/2015,"Skokie, IL","The creative and delicious menu at Mesa Verde was matched by attentive and welcoming staff. We always search for veggie restaurants when we travel  and this time we found an exquisite dining experience in Santa Barbara. The only downside was having to choose from an original and expansive menu of small plates, salads, and main courses that offered so many yummy possibilities. We started with flatbread with the most hearty humus accented by romescu, and a grilled peach salad with black lentils, flavorful greens, and other wonderful surprises. We moved on to roasted cauliflower and smoked mushroom lasagna, and each plate offered an array of flavors, ingredients, and food discoveries. We appreciated every bite.",5 star rating,Marshall K.

7/10/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","I almost didn't go due to some reviews being so negative, and due to the rather unfriendly/unhelpful ""No Modifications. No Substitutions."" on their menu. I'm glad I gave it a chance anyway! I am vegan (ethical reasons) and my son has celiac, so we can be picky :) , and there are limited places in town that can accommodate both of us. We tried three food items, sharing everything: our appetizer, the Roasted California Sunchoke with Fava Bean Puree, was exquisite. Neither of us had had a sunchoke before, and we both enjoyed it. The fava bean puree with oats, hazelnuts and walnut oil was eye-rollingly tasty if just a _tad_ too salty for me. Our entrees were the black bean , walnut, grilled kale burger and the polenta with garbanzos, okra, and kale. While they do offer gluten-free flatbread, they were out of it on our visit, so I took the flatbread that came with the burger and let my son have the majority of the burger. Yes, $15 is a lot for a veggie burger BUT this burger was unique. I've had many black bean burgers, enjoying most of them. This one was special. Different seasonings and sauces made it highly tasty, and it was very filling. The polenta was wonderful. I make homemade polenta, and I like what I make, but theirs had a better, softer texture than anything I've yet made. We didn't manage to finish the appetizer or the polenta, both filling up on the food that some other reviewers have called ""small portions"", and we took home the leftovers. To drink, I had a greens juice (forgot the name) that was fine, but nothing to rave about, and my son had a smoothie with berries and almond butter that he thought was ""okay"".We were sitting next to a woman who was dining alone, and we saw her tacos arrive at the table. They looked great. Later, she asked us about what we had eaten, and she told us both her mushroom taco and her black bean, sweet potato taco were very good. She also queried the man sitting at the table on her other side, and he reported that he had enjoyed the black bean burger and his grain-based ""coffee"".I hope they eventually add more desserts. So far, there are two listed, both tarts, presumably neither of them gluten free, one of them possibly vegan, the other vegetarian. (We did not have dessert.)Service was slow, which I had anticipated due to it being their first week, but friendly and helpful. We will definitely return. Oh, and we  arrived just after 12 noon and saw two empty parking spots right in front of the restaurant, so, for us, parking was not an issue. I think there are at least a total of 10 parking spots directly in front of the building.",4 star rating,Michelle R.

7/3/2015,"Mission Viejo, CA","I have been using Yelp for a few years now and this restaurant was so good it made me finally write my first review! We came up for the 4th of July weekend for my birthday. I got to pick where we ate today and I wanted to have a nice vegan lunch. My family was skeptical since most of them are not on plant based diets - but once they read the menu, they started to get excited about what their meals would taste like. It did not disappoint! Everything tasted great! We started off with the Polenta Fries and in about 30 seconds the 7 of us gobbled them up! Definitely you have to get these! My daughter loved the falafel sandwich. It was so flavorful! The empanadas were really good also. I ordered the pulled mushroom sandwich which was similar to a spicy pulled pork sandwich on flatbread. I would order this again except there were so many other items on the menu I would still love to try. Three of us got the BLTA on flatbread also - my two daughters and husband liked theirs, but my 13 year old son did not like his meal. I think he freaked out that the bacon was not real meat. haha! My son-in-law got the tacos with potatoes in them - I can't remember what they were called but he loved them! We also tried 3 desserts -  the cheesecake, the chocolate cake and the baklava. All I can say is that nothing was left because they were amazing! My family said that they were pleasantly surprised and are open to trying more vegan restaurants now. I wish we were staying in Santa Barbara longer so we could come back. Oh, and Anthony was a great waiter and very personable and looks like Keanu Reeves! haha!",5 star rating,Carol S.

For desert we had the vegan cheesecake and the baklava. It was a perfect ending to a great meal. Overall the number of menu items gave you a lot of different options. The atmosphere of the place was very relaxing. We ate outside on the patio (for those who want outdoors or to bring the dog!).  The staff was extremely friendly and one of the owners even stopped out to check  on us and make sure everything was done right.  Highly suggest trying this place even if you are not vegan.

We ordered from the weekend brunch menu, which included a nice variety of offerings. My husband and I shared two dishes; the empanadas and the BLTA. Both were so delicious in their own very distinct ways. First bite into the BLTA, and I couldnt get over how soft, fresh and delicious the bread was on this sandwich. I mean heavenly good!!  Then came the empanadas. First of all, I love savory dishes that incorporate jackfruit! This was so fresh tasting and the chimchurri sauce (I think) and the pickled cabbage, was just a party in my mouth. Along with the well seasoned delicious black beans! Husband opted for dessert menu as well. Upon the recommendation of the very generous manager, we tasted the chocolate cake and the baklava. Both were AMAZING. Both hubby and I agreed that our favorite was the baklava. I'd even come visit this restaurant just to split that dessert with a loved one! The dessert prices were in my opinion steep. But the overall food and presentation of everything was fresh, inviting and tasty.

1/1/2017,"Redondo Beach, CA","We were on a short trip to Santa Barbara over the weekend and we decided to stop by at Mesa Verde for dinner since a friend highly recommended it. It was an awesome experience overall. The food tasted great and the service was amazing too. We ordered empanadas for appetizer. For our mains we shared the couscous and cauliflower dish. Everything tasted amazing. We were also offered a complimentary vegan cheesecake which was out of this world so we ended up ordering one to go, lol. All the vegans and vegetarians in socal, please try this place out - it is totally worth the drive!! :)",5 star rating,Ami S.

8/5/2017,"Isla Vista, CA",This is no doubt the most amazing vegan food-scratch that- most amazing food period in Santa Barbara that I have had! The empanadas were beyond amazing and gluten free flatbread was divine. We started the meal with the must have polenta fries. I can't wait to come back! (As in I will be back tomorrow!),5 star rating,Coco M.
12/28/2016,"Gardena, CA","This is a very good vegetarian joint. The owner made sure we were happy. However, this offer did not influence my rating. We had the mozzarella pizza, fried brussel sprouts, and polenta fries. Everything taste extremely fresh. The mozzarella pizza was very good but was not a fan of the crust. It wasn't chewy, likely because it lacked gluten. The polenta fries were my favorite. The flavor and texture were unique, balanced, and delicious. The brussel sprouts would have been perfect but I find them too salty. The service was top notch.",4 star rating,Michael C.

8/16/2015,"Goleta, CA","Let me tell you about the best meal of my life! I am so grateful to find this wonderful restaurant. Was driving around looking for brunch and saw the sign reading ""Plant Based""...The only thing I did not like was trying to make up my mind! Everything sounded so good! I went for the Huaracha Azteca, I highly recommend this dish! They had no problem turning this dish vegan for me, replacing the egg with avocado. The perfect combination of savory, sweet, spicy, the textures and presentation were magnificent! The sourdough bread was so light and fluffy on the inside with the delicious fresh oven roasted flavor. The jackfruit chorizo is to die for! My mouth wanted to chew every bite as slowly as possible, cherishing every flavor presented. The flavors playing off of each other in perfect harmony, gave me goosebumps. Even after I was full I couldn't stop eating it until my plate was empty.I could eat here for every meal! I eat a plant based vegan diet and I often get sick from restaurant foods, but here there were no hidden ingredients, and food allergies and preferences are taken seriously here. I praise the creativity of the chef, the amazing service, delicious coffee, fantastic atmosphere and friendliness of the owner, who was there to make sure we enjoyed our meal fully. Everything from the comfortable seating, to the music choice, I couldn't be more grateful that this restaurant exists. Please try it! You will not be disappointed! I know I will be back week after week. Thank you Mesa Verde!",5 star rating,Bryanna E.

12/17/2016,"Camarillo, CA","This place is a gem, to say the least.  My wife brought me here originally a year ago because she doesn't do lactose or gluten, and she had heard this place was good from some coworkers.  I personally eat all foods, and was a little reluctant to go to a vegan restaurant, but I'm glad I went, because this place has amazing food that is insanely creative.  This place is the pinnacle of culinary creativity, and the chef's are obviously intensely passionate about their vision for this restaurant and their food creations.  It opened my mind to the possibilities of food, and the challenge of cooking vegan has brought out a genius in their ability to transcend the traditional.  And, its a low key restaurant on the mesa, which is crazy because the food is probably the most tasty and creative i've ever had, and the service is great too.  This kind of food doesnt exist outside of fancy shmantzy reataurants.  Words cant describe this restaurant- you have to experience it for yourself... trust me.  My wife and I moved away from santa barbara a while ago, but we have come back to this place numerous times cuz its crazy good.  For all you vegan food skeptics out there, just try this place.... it will blow your mind.",5 star rating,Mitch B.
7/2/2017,"Minneapolis, MN","Mesa Verde had amazing vegan food! We shared the BLTA and Street Tacos, both were delicious. The tacos were beautifully prepared with tiny flowers and chives on top, a yummy mix of beans, jackfruit, tomatoes, and jalapeños as the filling, and a tasty tortilla as the base. The BLTA was also amazing... the layers of bacon tempe, avocado, tomato, horseradish, and bread created an extremely rich flavor; it was so good that I wish I had one right now! As we were preparing to pay the bill, the owner came over to us and insisted we try a small dessert... our waiter brought out a beautifully plated dish of vegan baklava and vegan vanilla ice cream drizzled in a fruit sauce. The incredible dessert and generosity of the owner made our meal at Mesa Verde thoroughly enjoyable and a very memorable dining experience.",5 star rating,Susan S.

Exceeded my expectations by a long shot. I'm from the east coast and would visit Santa Barbara again to eat here among other things (like hit up the beach ).

7/11/2016,"Baldwin Park, CA",When there is nothing to complian about you get 5 stars in my book. The customer service was great. The  hostess was friendly and the waiter was detailed in menu options and recemmendations. The food was delicious. Dinner started with hummus and pita bread which was unlike any hummus I've had ever had. I tried the pulled mushroom plate and poblano pizza. The variety of spice and zestiness in the pulled mushroom was amazing and with just the right amount of crunch from the sweet pickles and radishes. The pizza was fresh and saucy and with just the perfect amount of cheese to my liking ( which is not alot). The hostess knew it was our first time here and insisted we try the baklava on the house. Tell me tell you it was one of the  best desserts I've ever had at a restuarant. It was served alongside vegan Vanilla ice cream which was sprinkled with graham cookie powder which made it a perfect combination. The ambience was inviting and peaceful. If I didnt live 2 hours away it would be a regular spot of mine.,5 star rating,Yesenia L.

(The one with goat cheese and much else that don't normally make it onto a pizza at most other places). The burger was quite unique although aside from using a patty that has *some* ground beef, it did not taste anything like a hamburger. No complaints though, whatever its name, it tasted great. I'd love come back.",5 star rating,Tatil S.

Quality ingredients. Thoughtfully prepared dishes. Service was excellent! This restaurant could easily compete with any restaurant in Los Angeles!!

6/23/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Mesa Verde catered for 83 guests at my wedding celebration in Santa Barbara. And I could not be happier with their service. I ordered a California salad and two vegan mains for a buffet style dinner. Rami, one of the managers, oversaw this order himself. Food was delivered right on time. Furnace candles were provided to keep the dishes warm. The aesthetics of the dishes was great as usual. Everyone, including my carnivore friends, couldn't stop complementing the food choices.Mesa Verde was also very generous with the quantity. I was a bit worried about not having enough food, but in the end, there was plenty of leftovers, which my guests were more than happy to go home with. Highly recommend!!",5 star rating,Ning M.

The place has a great atmosphere and I love their vegan options, however I feel like I paid a lot of money and did not get that much food. When I got back to work and opened my lunch, the portion size was ridiculously small and not presented very well/not very appetizing. This could have been a mistake and their presentation may be different if you eat in, but I was not very pleased and did not return so I give it 4/5.",4 star rating,Evelyn B.

5/7/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","Good quality food and inventive... but for the prices, the restaurant lacks ambiance and stress-free waiter service. I cook myself using most of the organic veggies from Mesa Produce. So when I decide to spend money on going out to a restaurant, I don't want to worry about sitting in an awkward seat, waiting too long for the server, the drinks, the food or my bill. So as much as I respect what they are trying to do (I'm organic, non-GMO, vegetarian, etc...), the experience wasn't quite worth the money. And I only live a couple of blocks away. I would have loved to say I was a ""regular"". About a month before I had been there to eat, I was getting gas next door and dropped in to look at a menu. The women I talked to very impatiently told me that they were short on menus as it was and they couldn't give me anything. WHAT?!! Totally wrong answer. Its not as if they had permanent high quality eco-friendly plastic menus. They were simply pieces of paper... so put more ink and paper in the printer and make sure you have enough... always.",3 star rating,William R.

3/16/2018,"Monterey Park, CA","This is a restaurant that started off well and seemed to go down hill. The first few times I went I enjoyed it, but thought they relied too much on the same flavor profile for a lot of the dishes. The last time I went I had to send back the first dish (which is something I hardly ever do) and then ordered a second dish which included veggies (which were fine, but not fully cooked) and black rice. The rice was about 50% uncooked and hard. I didn't send that dish back because I didn't want to be a pain. However, it was clear to me that whoever was cooking was not taste testing the food. For the high prices they charge, they should be monitoring the quality of something as simple as cooking rice. To the credit of the waiter, he comped the first dish that had to be sent back (without me asking) and was polite about it. I hate to say it, but I think the reviews are good partly because there aren't enough vegan/vegetarian places in town. I probably won't be going back after having a few bad meals in a row. While I very much want to be able to enjoy good quality vegan food, I can't justify spending so much money on food that is so inconsistent.",3 star rating,Nic L.

And don't think it is just stale pita bread.  It was like pillows with just the right amount of olive oil and seasonings.  We wanted to have the baklava for dessert, but were too full.  We will definitely come back.By the way, the service was just great as well.  I think our server was new, but he had been well trained and others were there to quietly just check in and see how things were.  They were so truly kind and friendly.  Really, what a find!",5 star rating,Genese I.

The flavors and spices were amazing and not once did we miss meat.  The tagine, smoked mushrooms, polenta fries and baklava were standouts. The service was attentive and friendly, and it was incredibly interesting talking to the owner and hearing about how he developed his concept and menu.

I loved them both! He liked the flavor of the burger, but not the texture. He really liked the grilled cheese sandwich and the homemade potato chips. It's not your normal grilled cheese, it's better IMHO. We also have baklava with vanilla ice cream (all vegan) for dessert. So yummy good!! Everyone was super nice and attentive. We live in LA, but will definitely come here again on our next visit to SB.",5 star rating,Jo Jo P.

The setting makes you feel as though you are in the middle of the jungle with the raw materials and plants used as shade. The food was so fresh and flavorful. The owner, Jamal, walked around to every table several times to check on people and even offered us a few samples of dessert to try. We will definitely be back when we visit again.",5 star rating,Natosha M.

11/5/2016,"Corning, NY","Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. For the record, I'm vegan but my husband is not. I went on to yelp not looking for a vegan restaurant but just a highly rated restaurant in our area. I was shocked when the highest rated restaurant was also vegan (that never happens) so we had to try it.  We were not disappointed. Food was creative and well prepared. We were really hungry so we ordered a lot of food. We shared the roasted corn (delicious), hummus and flatbread (loved the hummus- had delicious veggies around the edge) and also ordered the cashew cheese board. I have to pause here because this cashew cheese was fabulous, the best I've ever had. It was paired with many delicious things.  Holy #%$!, it was amazing. My husband proclaimed if we could get cheese like this he could go vegan. Amazing. For our main dishes my husband ordered the lasagna. He's very traditional with his pasta dishes and thought it was a little spicy but ok. I ordered the pulled smoked mushroom which seemed like a deconstructed vegan pulled pork sandwich. It was well prepared and delicious. We opted to share the chocolate cake which was good, not the best ever but very solid with good flavors. Overall an excellent meal. If you go you have to order the cheese board, you will be glad you did.",5 star rating,Stephanie M.

Very fresh ingredients, displayed artistically (including edible flowers). We also ordered a side of the flatbread, which had an awesome za'atar seasoning -- they sell some of their seasonings but did not have za'atar to sell, otherwise we would have purchased a bottle for home. Service was great! We never had empty cups of water on the table. We're definitely coming back!!",5 star rating,Nina T.

10/16/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","OK, so I could NOT wait to give this review! I wanted something different for my birthday, which was yesterday, so I searched ""vegetarian restaurant in santa barbara"" and Mesa Verde came up. I saw it had 96 reviews and 4 stars so I read further. Time after time I read how the kale burger was amazing, the empanadas were incredible, Market Salad fantastic and I thought OK, I'll check it out. I kept remembering, ""never try something new/unfamiliar on a special occasion."" I work very hard, I have 4 children, I'm going to school full-time and I REALLY didn't want to waste my money, my time, and have a bad night because of the typical bland food I usually have to eat as a vegetarian.My first impression when I drove up and saw the outdoor seating area with these gorgeous streaks of fire was, ""Hm, well that's impressive. Wonder what their menu looks like."" I am SO used to trying to eat an appetizer or put side dishes together to create a meal out of potatoes, rice and a few bland veggies, that I suppose I've learned to deal with mediocrity (with four kids I am on a budget you know). So when I picked up the menu and started reading these SERIOUSLY INCREDIBLE INGREDIENTS, I realized I was saying, ""Mmmmm"" and ""Oh my God no way"" out loud and my kids found that too funny, of course. I could not wait to eat!We ordered the following dishes and I seriously had to stop ordering:*ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS W/ JACKFRUIT 'CHORIZO'  *WILD MUSHROOM TACOS. LEMON CREME FRAICHE. HARISSA. PEPITAS. BABY SPRING ONION  *GRILLED PEACH SALAD. AVOCADO. SHISHITO PEPPERS. CURED MEYER LEMON. ROMESCO. BLACK LENTIL. PEA TENDRIL. MARKET RADISH. BLUEBERRY CHIPOTLE SALSA. WATERCRESS*RAS EL HANOUT LINGUINI W/ PUMPKIN. TOMATO. TARRAGON. ONION. GARLIC. THYME. WHITE WINE. *SWEET POTATO TRIO. MASH, ROASTED & FRIED W/ SAGE AND BROWN BUTTER SHAVED BRUSSELS. HAZELNUT. MANCHEGO. PUMPKIN SEEDS. MALDON SEA SALT. LEMON JUICE. ZA 'ATAR.*HUMMUS. FIG. CARAMELIZED ONION. HONEY. MALDON SALT.I copied these from the menu because I started to write Brussels sprouts, three potato something or other, and wanted to do their menu justice. Hope it's OK that I copied/pasted, but these are the items we ordered. There were SIX of us including myself, my starving and very buff husband and three teenage boys who don't know the meaning of the words, ""I'm full"" plus my 8-year old daughter who, despite her slender appearance, can really pack it in! MAN we were stuffed! I topped it off with the ""Artemis' Brew: raspberry leaf, hibiscus, rose petal, rose hips, pau d'arco, St. John's Wort. This floral brew is immune-boosting, mood-boosting, and great for women's health. Served with raw honey."" May as well put it on the dessert menu 'cause I'm comin' back for more o' dat!So, as you can see, I'm in LOVE with this place! My new fav for sure! I'm completely obsessed with their food and canNOT wait to go back...for dinner...again tonight!If you're a vegetarian you'll be in Heaven, guaranteed. There is NO MEAT in the building so you're safe to order at will! My hubby even (who swears there's nothing better than a steak) ate well, got full, nuff said.You're nuts if you don't go to this place!",5 star rating,Phoebe D.

We were the first to arrive at the restaurant which only had 4 tables of people when we left. Waitress asks if we wanted a refill on ice tea (which was half full). Took glass away and brought back a full one and had the nerve to charge an additional $3.00 without telling us. That is poor service. Tea was not very good either. RIP OFF!!!",1 star rating,Lee K.

Our food came our super fast but our tea was a little behind it; our server gave us a free dessert though for our trouble (the baklava was maybe the best I've had!) the only negative is the small parking lot, but there is plenty of parking around the corner.",5 star rating,Kenneth F.

I love that Mesa Verde is off the beaten path- it is a sweet, modern, rustic place with magical food!  We went for an early lunch, my husband got the Street Tacos & I got the Polenta Fries & we loved them both. Unique & delectable flavors blended together in a very pleasing & unexpected way.  We also tried the delicious Baklava for dessert! Baklava is one of my favorites in general and this version was excellent-with vanilla ice cream. pomegranate molasses, pistachio, mint & a bit of sumac- perfection!  Can't wait to go back & try more of these outstanding dishes!",5 star rating,Spark G.
5/8/2016,"Goleta, CA","Based on the reviews I was expecting to be blown away....but....no.  First, it's really loud.  Maybe it's the cement walls and floors but it was one of the loudest places I've been to in quite some time.  Second, not a fan of establishments that bring out patrons food at different times.  Kinda awkward to either eat while your company waits, or wait and let your food get cold until the other order arrives.  The lasagna was really good, the salad not so much.  Cheesecake was outstanding.  I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years so it was nice to not have to worry about ingredients or have to order food but ""leave off ______"".",3 star rating,Michael B.

That's probably more good than 2 people should have but we couldn't resist and finished every last bite. To top off, we ordered the chocolate cake which did not disappoint.

3/22/2016,"Los Angeles, CA","Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  My husband and I visited SB recently and as we are vegan and saw the high Yelp reviews decided to try Mesa Verde.  If you are a foodie -- you will be in HEAVEN!!  The food was off the hook.  Every single dish beautiful, tasty and super filling.  Woah was it filling.  We tried the Patatas Bravas Tacos, the Picadillo Empanadas and the Macadamia Butter Crostini.  All were amazing!!  My personal favorite was the Crostini followed by the Patatas Bravas, then the Empanada.  My husband loved the Empanadas the most then the Crostini followed by the Patatas Bravas.  Go figure.  We both were super duper impressed and very very happy.  Originally we also ordered the Risotto...however we were sooo full on the other three tapas we couldn't stomach the Risotto.  Especially since we needed to save room for dessert. :)  They were super nice and changed our order no problem.  Dessert I'm sorry I don't recall the name but it was a chocolate brownie cake with a chocolate mousse and some candied brittle.  Soooo yummy!!  Only thing I'd say steer clear of which I won't knock because everyone has their own taste when it comes to this stuff -- I didn't like the Berry Ginger Kombucha.  It fell kind of flat for my liking and the ""ginger"" you couldn't taste it at all.  Though I am a huge fan of Health Ade brand so they have spoiled me to like a certain flavor/fizz profile.  Of course they have PLENTY of drinks to chose from so you will be very happy I'm sure. :)",5 star rating,Susie K.

My reasons for four rather than five stars: 1) all the orders for the table do not come at the same time; I sat with my food in front of me for five minutes before my dining companion was served and was told that it's the policy of the restaurant to bring each dish when it's ready; and 2) ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" do not necessarily mean healthier or low-calorie; a number of dishes are fried and I suspect the calorie content of the various items is quite high.",4 star rating,Doris S.

When we asked what we should order, the staff member said 'close your eyes and pick'.  There are approximately 8 items on the lunch menu.  We had the polenta fries and the patatas bravas tacos.  Both were incredible!  The flavors were outstanding. We also tried the baklava.  It's vegan !!!!  It was wonderful!!!!!!Prices are reasonable and the food is DELICIOUS!  We enjoyed our meal so much, that we are returning for dinner!  If you're in Santa Barbara, you must eat here. You will not be disappointed!  Full disclosure....there are 2 items on the dinner menu that aren't vegan.So...we returned for dinner, and we were NOT disappointed.  I enjoyed the gluten free, vegan pizza.

I was suffering through a head and chest cold, when a friend called to say she was in town (from Bali!) and wanted to meet up here for dinner. I had never visited Mesa Verde. I arrived ahead of my friend and was waiting for her, when the owner and waitstaff could see how weak and barely viable I was. They sat me in a warm, beautiful spot and the owner, Jamal, graciously brought me a raw, organic, pressed green drink that he said was a gift from Mesa Verde, and that it would help in my recovery. What an incredibly kind gesture! My friend arrived, we ordered our food, and we were treated to some fabulous and delicious entrees, with mine being very carefully made to avoid a food allergy. Both of us were so impressed with Jamal and his Mesa Verde staff that I am going to stop by there with a special thank you to, hopefully, touch their hearts as much as they touched mine that evening!",5 star rating,Barbara B.

8/13/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","We shared the walnut-kale burger and the grilled polenta bowl. I was skeptical about the burger because I'm a big meat eater, but it was really good. The polenta bowl was good too, and had a good assortment of veggies in it. We also shared a mango smoothie, which was excellent, but it was pricey ($10). Overall, I would go here again. I think they should add more items to the menu, and serve bread with the meal because the portions are fairly small. This is a good place for sharing plates.",5 star rating,Sam K.

This place is exceptionally good, I especially love the Market Salad, The Kale Burger, The Street Tacos, The Wild Mushroom Tacos, The jerusalem artichoke dish was amazing, and a dish w regular artichokes was also amazing. I've also had the Falaffal(i recommend sharing this with a salad) I live nearby and watched the transformation from the old Cliff's and Co into Mesa Verde and the builder Jason did such a great job, I love sitting on the patio, it is always very clean, and I love the modern re-purposed style.Jamal the Maitre'D is one of the kindest people I have ever met and The Chef Greg has a great vision with delectable and unusual spice/veggie pairings. Most of the wait staff is really on it, super friendly and helpful, at times they have been a little disorganized, but it seems that they are smoothing those kinks out. If you are going to order to go, call ahead, even just for dessert it can take 15minutes...And you have to try the desserts, ALL the tarts and cakes have been exceptionally delicious.",5 star rating,Nicole I.
12/17/2015,"Salinas, CA","This is my new favorite restaurant in the world. We tried the soup,  which was a delicious puree of mushrooms with vegetables. The flat bread has a seasoning called satar. It is a mix of herbs,  sesame seeds and salt. It is TO DIE FOR. The street tacos are made with home made tortillas! The Caesar salad had huge caper berries and a delicious cashew dressing. We ate so much!  Including the empanadas, pumpkin cheesecake, chocolate cake,  chai tea and prosecco. By the way,  the Pumkin cheesecake had a tiny sprinkling of thyme on one corner,  served over marigold flower petals and a coconut cream canelle. Did I spell that right? It doesn't matter!  The food was beyond delicious. It was such a wonderful experience! !!!!!!! Thank you thank you thank you.

7/24/2016,"Simi Valley, CA","First thing I did when I arrived in Santa Barbara was research local vegan restaurants. Found Mesa Verde so we decided to have dinner there tonight. We walked into a nice restaurant decorated with reclaimed wood and greeted by friendly staff. We started off with the Cashew Cheese Board then had the Grilled Peach and Avocado Salad. Followed by the Rajas Tacos and the Flat Bread with Hummus, Figs and Caramelized Onions. For dessert we had Baklava with Vanilla Ice cream and pistachios. The dishes all came out with such great presentation and the flavors were delicious. My mother who is not vegan but has eaten at vegan restaurants with me reluctantly, loved everything we ate at Mesa Verde. We need to have one open up in Ventura or LA County! If you're planning a trip to Santa Barbara, make sure you pay a visit to Mesa Verde. You will not be disappointed.",5 star rating,Lorie M.
7/22/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","Limited menu, tasty and different from what you'd expect, but certainly overpriced.  I've dined there three times, and there's really not enough choices to entice me to return. Still, the originality of some of their offerings, and the stricture of being vegan make me hope they'll evolve with time and customer feedback.  They certainly are the sole occupants of the niche.",3 star rating,Anselmo S.

5/22/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","This place is absolutely delicious and they make gorgeous food at a great price.  It's incredibly flavorful.  I had the street tacos as pictured in some of the photos and they were amazing.  The best part is that they taste so good and I feel great after eating them.  I typically don't eat vegan - I'm a huge meat & cheese lover - but these tacos have so much flavor you don't need anything to make them better.  They are doing a great job.  What you may not know is how beautiful it is inside and out.  The design of the restaurant is really super pretty and worth checking out.  Their napkins are so pretty they are the kind of dish towel napkins that my friend always jokes about stealing - that's how great they are.  Anyways, it's a new favorite and I will be going back.  It takes a lot of effort to make food like this taste so amazing.  I'm a chef myself and I don't think I could pull it off the way they do!",5 star rating,Jennifer S.

To start, the food is fresh and organic, but also prepared in a way that is interesting and delicious. The juices and kombuchas are superlative! They are fresh and made on site and after drinking them I feel refreshed and I feel like I am putting the highest quality ingredients in my body. Lastly, the owners and the staff are very welcoming and genuinely friendly. This is one of my favorite spots for lunch. Thank you Mesa Verde!",5 star rating,M G.
5/14/2016,"Cupertino, CA","We were there with friends earlier and were surprised it was empty! We started with the grilled flatbread with hummus, then got all four dishes the waiter suggested- umami burger, potato latkes, blta flatbread and the couscous tagine. The burger and the flatbread were piled up so high that we had to eat those dishes deconstructed.  The umami burger had a beet sauce that oozed out and ruined the shirt I was wearing.  The beet sauce was not mentioned anywhere because otherwise I would not have ordered it - not a big fan of beets.  The standout dish would be the couscous tagine brunch bowl- flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit on the spicy side but enough for two.  Location is in a strip mall in a residential area- much better area is to stay on State Street- lots of places to eat there.",3 star rating,S P.
8/3/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","I was very excited for another much needed healthy option in SB... however was truly disappointed at MV.  A salad that costs $15 should be substantial, my grilled bread and heirloom tomato salad had all of maybe 1/3 of a tomato in it.  A margherita pizza should have enough basil and tomato so one can taste it- the one we had was all bread.  I'm a small girl and do not like huge portions but these were RIDICULOUS- especially for the price.  The portions need to be fair with the prices or the dishes need to come with sides... a small salad with a pizza, or a side of flat bread with the tagine.  I really feel like the potential is there.  But if it remains the same you are seriously better off buying the ingredients and cooking at home- it would be much cheaper!!!",2 star rating,Mariola 9.
8/2/2014,"Los Angeles, CA",I must say I would love to give this place 4 stars because the food was actually good.  At the end of the meal we decided to get a Sun smoothie togo.. After waiting around for 15 minutes they tell me it is coming up.. So I waited around.. Finally I was so fed up I asked if they have even started on it.. They finally decide to tell me they didn't even have mangos! What the heck!! Shouldn't your server have even mentioned it when I put the order in... So fine she says she will give me back my money.. She hands me a 6...ummmm it's 10 dollars (you don't even know your prices???).. Talk about horrible customer service!! RIDICULOUS,1 star rating,V G.

When we arrived we had no idea that it was a vegetarian/vegan restaurant. Nevertheless, we sat down to eat. The food was flavorful and satiating. I had the Street Tacos and my husband had the Empanadas. My sister had Tacos with Potatoes in it. My children had a gluten free pizza. The waitress informed us that everything was organic down to the corn tortillas!  Everyone was very happy with their food. I also had an Herbal Coffee. We ended the meal with a delicious chocolate dessert. The meal left my stomach feeling soothed and happy. The people working there were warm and friendly.

5/1/2015,"Oakland, CA","OMG. I am a Vegan Chef, visiting from the Bay Area. We are so lucky to have MANY amazing Vegan restaurants up there, but this is some of the best Vegan food I have ever had. We ordered the most amazing roasted brussels sprout dish as a starter. It had pickled onion, capers, fava bean puree, pepitas, and macambo. We literally fought over it..it was perfection.  We also had a beautiful Caesar Salad with Avocado. Delicious. I had the Purple Potato Burger for my entree. So many exciting combinations of flavors and textures! With a blackberry slaw and chimichurri. Amazing.  My friend had the lasagna which she really enjoyed as well. We finished it off with Baklava that had an amazing pomegranate molasses to balance out the sweetness. Excellent. The service was friendly, warm, and efficient. Really innovative flavor combinations, and thoughtful use of seasonal produce. I WISH we had this restaurant in my neighborhood. We are planning to go back for Brunch before we head home on Sunday.

9/15/2014,"Huntington Beach, CA","Nice menu and tasty food. We ordered the mushroom tacos and grilled eggplant to start. I'd order both again. However, the burrata on the grilled eggplant loses that amazing texture when it's heated up. It turned into melted mozzarella by the time it reached our table. Not bad, but not ideal if you're a burrata lover. Entrees were the couscous and grilled vegetables and the grilled polenta. Again, good flavors, heavily North African, which I love. Only giving 4 stars, as the service was strange. Open seating on a Sunday night, which was fine. However, we had to wait close to 10 mins for a server to visit our table, when the restaurant was probably 1/4 full. They only pour water if you request it, which we had to (it wasn't offered).  We ordered a beer and a glass of prosecco. Prosecco arrived in an unopened split, which the server left on the table and walked away. I'm certainly not above opening my own split, but i would've expected her to at least make the offer to open and pour it for me. The tacos were brought to the table first. About 5 minutes later, the eggplant was brought out with my polenta bowl. Had the polenta not been steaming hot, it would've gotten cold, as it took about 20 minutes to finish the starters. Overall, a nice place, but needs to smooth out the edges for service to match the creative menu and great flavors.",4 star rating,Kelly S.
7/4/2015,"San Francisco, CA","This is the best-est place ever in Santa Barbara!!! Everything we tried - the tacos, the macro bowl, the empanadas - everything was mind-blowingly amazing!! Reminds me of a place in Old Nice, France called Zucca Magica along with Chin Chin, Long Grain, and Tonka in Melbourne, etc  ...   This restaurant fits right in amongst those ... Simply the way food should be - bursting with flavors!!!  ....

9/28/2015,"San Francisco, CA","While the food was delicious for those who are seeking healthier foods, it did not suite my palette very well - fault on my part and not the restaurant's. However, I came here to rave about the phenomenal customer service I experienced. I ordered something that I wasn't particularly fond of and didn't have the desire to finish it. The waiter noticed that I had not really touched my food and offered me a take out box, which i politely declined. He then asked if I didn't like the food and I gently said it wasn't my favorite, expecting to just suck it up as a loss so I can just pay for my food and leave. When he came back with the bill, he had taken my order off the tab no questions asked. I thought that was the most kind gesture and I really appreciated it so much. Will recommend just because he was nice. Food was good too if you are into healthy options.",4 star rating,Vivian L.
1/8/2016,"San Francisco, CA","Vegan/ vegetarian or not, hands down Mesa Verde is the best restaurant in town.  Their dishes are unique, tasty and always surprisingly awesome.  I am very sensitive to spicy foods (allergic to chilis) and about 1/2 of the dishes have some sort of very spicy addition, but as long as I request non-spicy, they are able to accommodate.  Favs: polenta fries (ordered non-spicy), the bowls, brussel sprout dish, oh wow I could go on and on.  Try everything, it's a delight!",5 star rating,Shana B.

9/28/2017,"Lower State, Santa Barbara, CA","so...it's about time I've written a thoughtful, well deserved review for mesa verde. Ever since I started coming here, maybe two years ago, it has been my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara. This is my boy friend and I's favorite spot! The service is so friendly and accommodating and the two co-owners are great! Although I myself am vegan, my vegan AND non vegan friends have loved the food (especially the STREET TACOS)! the atmosphere is really beautiful, unique and surprisingly feels really intimate and quiet for its location. If I'm not mistaken I've seen some of the staff at the farmers market before, I assume getting the best quality produce for their restaurant, so that's an awesome sign. The desserts keep getting better and better I love the chocolate cake but the cheese cake is also incredible... and I thought I didn't like cheese cake!

9/14/2014,"Los Angeles, CA","Very delicious and great ambiance. Love the low ceilings and the comfy yet airy feel. Had the mushroom tacos and they were just delicious. Even the corn tortillas were great. Only thing I'd comment negatively about was all the sauce that wasn't on the taco but on the wood serving block it was delivered on. Is this a style? Found it kind of annoying when it was hard to scrape into the taco. Next was the peach and black lentil salad. It was very delicious  but VERY SMALL and also having the sauce served on a wood block didn't work well. Block was also too small even for the small portion size so parts of our salad were always falling on the floor. Next we had fig, hummus and honey flatbread. Really good. Seemed kind of pricey to add that very light sprinkling of cheese for $2. But tasted great. For desert we had the cheesecake. Maybe I don't like vegan desserts, because every one--no matter how people rave about it--I find average, or ""good for vegan,"" which I think means desserts should't be vegan. Service was excellent. Overall: Very delicious, portion too small, too pricey, some of the saucy stuff needs to not be served on that block.",4 star rating,S W.
9/7/2015,"Los Angeles, CA",Wow! Food was Amazing. I've been to numerous vegetarian places and nothing compares to their food. Their cauliflower dish and their street tacos are a must.

5/20/2015,"Snohomish, WA","Torn between 2 or 3 stars on this one, but the owner was so nice that I have to give them a little bump for service. The food was just okay. We've been vegan for decades and have definitely had better, but it wasn't bad...there just wasn't a ""wow"" factor. I had a bowl that was basically vegetable soup and chickpeas poured over polenta (not the most appetizing thing I've ever seen, but the serving size was generous). Also, the ambiance was seriously lacking. We were crammed into a teeny table next to a loud and obnoxious group of college students, right next to the door which caused us to freeze every time someone came in or out even though we were both bundled in our coats the whole time. It probably tainted the whole experience. If you're in the mood to try out something new, I wouldn't discourage you...but don't set your expectations too high either.",3 star rating,Kristi H.

The latter is a little hard to read and the descriptions are not super helpful, but for someone who is prepared to go out on a limb, this is a good choice.",3 star rating,Maureen G.
8/8/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","You won't find a finer vegetarian / vegan eatery in Southern Calfornia.

You won't miss meat at Mesa Verde, believe me. I'm a convert solely thanks to the outstanding food here. Presentation is first rate, portions are well measured and not overbearing, stellar service. Absolutely the best restaurant on the Mesa in Santa Barbara, and certainly one of the top five Santa Barbara eateries in the city.",5 star rating,Frank B.
8/5/2015,"Skokie, IL","The creative menu and delicious food was matched by caring and attentive service. We often search for vegetarian food when we're traveling, but this was extraordinary plant-based quisine--some familiar, some new. We loved the grilled peach salad with avocado, black lentils, romesco, and wonderful greens. But we actually enjoyed eating, tasting, and discovering  all the amazing ingredients in everything we ordered.",5 star rating,Judy K.

11/29/2014,"Menlo Park, CA","I had beans, walnut and grilled kale burger. It was really delicious and juice, unconventionally for a burger it was on a flat bread and had muhammara, a soft of bell pepper paste. Also had the goat cheese flat bread pizza. It was the best pizza ever, I'd highly recommended trying out the pizzas here.",5 star rating,Melike G.

Wish the group here success!!",5 star rating,Christy M.
10/1/2015,"Austin, TX","I really wanted to dislike Mesa Verde because the whole vegetarian, vegan, juice-cleansing, gluten free, eating-restrictive craze just doesn't jive with me. I stand HUGELY corrected. This vegetarian restaurant blew me away with its flavorful, unique, and beautifully prepared dishes. The range and subtleness of flavors is delightful and intriguing in a way that keeps me coming back on a regular basis to try new things. Factor in a lovely wine, juice (ok, ok - I LIKE juice, just not as a full meal), and tea list and you have the makings of a perfect afternoon or evening. The ambiance is soothing and intimate, making it a great lunch or dinner spot for a leisurely meal over some great conversation. While you're at the cash register, take a few moments to watch the kitchen gallery - you'll see the chefs delicately placing colorful edible flowers and arranging artistic morsels to perfection. Seriously not to be missed.",5 star rating,Whitney K.

5/4/2017,"Santa Barbara, CA","Everything at Mesa Verde is beautifully presented, organic, locally sourced, and as a vegan it is definitely the best option in Santa Barbara.  I had to take off one star just because I find a lot of things there overpriced or overspiced.  I have been there three times now and my first meal was definitely the best - pulled smoked mushrooms with, ""picadillo. caramelized onion. grilled flatbread. sweet potato crisps. cornichon. pickled turnip. harissa. dijon. dried jalapeno powder. pink lady apple.""  It was a gorgeous plate and the mushrooms were excellent.  I left full and happy.  The second two times I went, I was a little disappointed - the hummus with za'atar flatbread had wayyy too much za'atar on top to the point where I had to scrape off the top layer, and wasn't as good as the stuff I make at home (and for $10 - jeez!).  And some of the ingredients seemed to be missing from the roasted cauliflower, or were so sparse we didn't notice them.  I guess it is hit-and-miss with some of the dishes, but overall the quality is excellent and the styling is wonderful.  Definitely a special occasion kind of place.",4 star rating,Katrina M.

8/1/2014,"San Francisco, CA","Loved Mesa Verde! I had the black bean burger and a couple of slices of pizza and loved both of them. I also had a bite of the polenta bowl which was tasty as well. I'm a big fan of vegetarian restaurants so this was right up my alley. One of the people I was with ordered hot tea which took a while to get to our table. We were half way done with our meal before it came, but our waitress came over a couple times explaining how they freshly brew it which takes a little bit longer and how they ran out of clean tea pots. The food was good, the staff was nice and they even gave us a little pastry on the house. Everyone I was with said they would come back and recommend this restaurant:)",4 star rating,Kemi N.

The eggplant burrata, sunchoke bowl, wild mushroom tacos, falafel were standouts.  Small kitchen and not too allergy friendly because they offer no modification or customization.",5 star rating,Sudha N.
3/3/2015,"Santa Barbara, CA","I love this place so much that it is where I chose to spend my birthday. What I most appreciate is that they don't try to replicate a meat dish, but truly own the plant-based diet. It's refreshing. The menu changes so what I suggest may not be there. However, we had the brussel sprout and fava bean appetizer and I has the vegan Caesar salad - both delicious. We also had vegan pistachio baklava with vanilla ice cream for dessert. It was one of my favorite desserts ever...a perfect balance of salty, sweet and creamy. It's a bit out of the way for tourists, but if you are vegetarian or vegan, it is worth the 10 minute drive. I would give it 5 stars but the seats are quite uncomfortable after awhile and the parking situation is difficult.",4 star rating,Elysse M.
10/23/2014,"Austin, TX","Really great food.  I mean, REALLY good.  I'm vegan and a good cook, so it's hard going out to eat because most places offer a pasta dish, or a salad, and let's face it--that's boring!  Mesa Verde has an inspired, fresh menu with loads of options that would please anyone--vegan or carnivore.  The service is great and restaurant itself is nicely done.",5 star rating,Jess D.
9/4/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","My whole family and I dined here yesterday evening and we had a very pleasant experience!!  We shared a variety of appetizers.  Among our favorites were the hummus, the brussel sprouts and the black kale salad.  Our main courses were presented beautifully and had a wonderful combination of flavors.  My dish was exceptional.  I had the roasted vegetable and couscous.   The only dish that we did not really care for was the Fez Seven Vegetable Tangine so the manager graciously did not charge us for that one.   I cannot wait to go back to try the mushroom tacos that everyone keeps on raving about!!  Our server was super nice and attentive.  The total bill was reasonable too.  I am so happy that this restaurant came to town and we are looking forward to coming back soon.",5 star rating,Robyn Theresa C.

8/12/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","It's taken Santa Barbara a while to find a well rounded vegetarian restaurant and Verde Mesa has finally delivered!  Ordered potluck style and tried everything from appetizers, main dishes, flat breads and desserts.  Top picks were the roasted carrots (trust me, this will blow your flip flops off), the polenta dish and the caramelized onion and Fig flat bread.  In addition to the food being delicious, the ambiance and service are excellent as well. Definitely going to be adding this to my regular SB hot spots:-)",5 star rating,Desiree P.
8/11/2014,"Goleta, CA",The  food was tasty and the service very good. The portions are very small and so for that reason I feel it is overpriced.  Don't go if you are really hungry unless you want to spend a lot of money to order multiple items.,3 star rating,Sam C.
8/5/2014,"Santa Barbara, CA","This restaurant is a sophisticated and yet relaxed dining spot; best meal I have had in some time. The food is creative and delicious with unusual (for the Santa Barbara area) spices and thoughtful presentation. Typically, vegetarian fare doesn't satisfy me and I end up eating a snack later, but the combination of ingredients and visual effects work to give a substantial feel. Try the Mushroom Tacos, Hummus with gluten free flatbed along with Cider or wine to drink. The server was great, the atmosphere unique and stylish. I have found my new favorite place to eat; you really feel like you've ""been somewhere"" in a different dimension. Highly recommend.  Hope they do well.",5 star rating,Shelley L.
7/19/2014,"Scottsdale, AZ","I have been a vegan for 10 years and going to restaurants is always a compromise until now. Thank you for providing those of us who choose a plant based diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons a wonderful place to dine. The thing I like best about this restaurant is that the food is not pretending to be anything but what it is. Plant based food. Not fake chicken, not fake wings, not fake hamburgers. Just beautiful, nutritious, life sustaining plants. The vegetables are beautiful and appetizing. The plate arrangements are attractive and simple. I had the falafel plate and it was delicious. Not too much and not too little. My fiance had the kale and bean burger which he was kind enough to let me taste. Delicious. My mother had the polenta bowl which was very tasty and well presented. My stepfather had the market salad which looked appetizing.The ambiance is honest and clean, I love the outdoor seating. I recommend the restaurant highly to anyone who seeks to improve their health, the health of the planet, and the dignity of animals.Deborah Wilson MD",5 star rating,Deborah W.

7/7/2014,"Santa Ynez, CA","Suspicious of the first 5 star review by AS...made 8 days even before Mesa Verde opened (today). Food is decent: creative, organic, veggie (NOT vegan) fare. Beautiful presentation, friendly and enthusiastic wait staff. Take-out menu with fancy/ethnic terms (no glossary) doesn't clearly indicate which dishes have dairy. Stars docked for 1) small portions & high prices considering what one actually gets especially with the tiny portioned ""share"" plates. I was charged $12 for the walnut sausage charcuterie which was equivalent to about 6 bites. Total bill was $27 for the walnut sausage appetizer & the $15 black bean, walnut & grilled kale burger on naan-like flatbread...just enough food for 1 hungry person  2) inadequate parking. My car, parked in the adjoining 7-11 lot because the MV lot was full, was almost towed while I waited the 25 min. for my take-out order. The tow guy was already there when I came out with my food and if I'd been any later my car would have been gone. He told me it was the 4th time he'd been out today to tow away MV customer cars. As I wasn't exactly blown away by the food, it's not likely I'll be back.",3 star rating,R W.
9/27/2015,"WEST HILLS, CA","Me and my boyfriend were visiting Santa Barbara as a day trip away from LA and stopped by this serene location to get some grub. The ambiance is incredible. We were immersed in a bohemian beach vibe immediately upon entering. We sat out on the patio and our culinary excursion into vegan paradise began. The menu was filled with unique combinations of herbs and spices. I ordered the Cochinita Pibil Portabello Tacos and the Black Bean, Walnut, and Grilled Kale Burger (I brought an appetite). It was served in an ornate fashion, it had so much visual appeal it was tough to destroy. The guilt quickly dissipated after the first bite, which was an explosion of robust, spicy flavored. The owner, Jamal, was so attentive and kind. There was so much flavor bursting from each dish, it was hard to not moan in delight after each chew. A week later I was still dreaming about the food. I decided I would have to take another trip out there despite the long distance. My second visit was even better than my first. I was welcomed back with a warm smile and led to my table. I ordered the Street Taco and the Polenta fries. Each bite was indescribable. I would recommend coming here for just the fries alone. Topped in white beans, grilled tomato, Carmelites onions, grilled kalamata olives, and a parsley pesto, it was my favorite thing on the menu. This place is off the charts spectacular. From the exquisite presentation, to the eye-roll inducing delectable food, this is a place you need to stop and try.",5 star rating,Katherine N.
10/29/2014,"Pasadena, CA","I don't know if we went on an off night - the restaurant was pretty full and it was mid week - or maybe it was just a fluke, but I wasn't a fan. I ordered the mushroom tacos because of all the rave reviews. I like mushrooms usually, and I was a vegetarian for 10 years, but this was too much. They seemed like slices of portobello, but the texture was a little rubbery and they tasted like they were seasoned in something lemony or sour. I didn't like the flavor or the texture. I wish there were other veggies/ textures and flavors to break up the mushrooms too. The Harissa flavor was delicious (I love Harissa), but not enough to make up for the monotony of slightly sour, rubbery mushrooms. In addition to the mushrooms tacos, we split the hummus appetizer. It was fine, but I thought the hummus could have been smoother or a little creamier and the pita was just covered in a surplus of herbs. The best part of the meal was the black bean and kale ""burger,"" which comes on pita or something similar, with a tahini sauce.",3 star rating,nikki a.
12/5/2015,"Goleta, CA","Wow this place is pretty interesting. I went here for a lunch date and the food was so beautiful. I would rate the food I got as 4/5, the food my bf got as 4.5/5, and the dessert as 4/5. My bf isn't vegan or vegetarian, so he kind of got tired of/to the point of being grossed out with his dish about 75% through. I felt the same with mine, there was too much spicy tomato sauce  in comparison to the potatoes/veggies and egg in my food so I mixed it with the rest of his food and we ordered extra bread to finish it off with. The atmosphere is nice-casual but the prices are fancy restaurant prices. We got the baklava and vegan ice-cream dessert and it was $10 for two small scoops of ice cream and one medium-sized piece of baklava. I would definitely eat here again one day, after I try out all the other vegan/vegetarian places in town. There is not much competition here in SB in that aspect, so I can see why this place is able to charge such high prices. For the price and fancy presentation of the food I just wish the ambiance would match.",4 star rating,Gabriella F.
10/6/2014,"Ojai, CA","Me and my partner came across this place checking out Happy Cow. Since we moved to Ojai from LA we do not have many options compared to where we were. I hear about a new Vegan/Vegetarian place opening up every month since we left LA. I just hope that this part of the state starts to catch up or we are going to be doing a lot of driving for awhile. Anyway..... we went to MesaVerde tonight and all I can say is that it was awesome. The food, Paola (our server), atmosphere....everything. We loved it. Everything is marked V for Vegan and GF for gluten free on the menu and Paola was incredibly helpful with questions. We ordered the olives & grapefruit tarragon, the black bean burger, brussels sprouts & jackfruit chorizzo, one of the pizzas (not Vegan for my my partner only....it had cheese) and a desert. My partner also had a beer. The flavors and spices were wonderful. Some of the dishes were a bit too spicy for me, but luckily they put things like the Harissa sauce on the side. They also take out cheese elements from any dish you want. VERY Vegan friendly. The meal before tax and tip was about $57. We were sated when we left and the portions were just perfect. I tend to never listen to reviews when someone complains about portions. I almost always disagree. So glad I decide for myself. I hope that they are around for a long time.",5 star rating,Stephanie S.
